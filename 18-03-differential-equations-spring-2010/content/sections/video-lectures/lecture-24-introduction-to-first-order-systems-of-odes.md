transcript: <p><span m='8000'>For the rest of the term, we are going to be studying
  not</span> <span m='11000'>just one differential equation at a time, but rather
  what are</span> <span m='15000'>called systems of differential equations.</span>
  </p><p><span m='18000'>Those are like systems of linear equations.</span> </p><p><span
  m='21000'>They have to be solved simultaneously,</span> <span m='23000'>in other
  words, not just one at a time.</span> </p><p><span m='25000'>So, how does a system
  look when you write it down?</span> </p><p><span m='30000'>Well, since we are going
  to be talking about systems of</span> <span m='34000'>ordinary differential equations,
  there still will be only one</span> <span m='38000'>independent variable, but there
  will be several</span> <span m='42000'>dependent variables. I am going to call,</span>
  <span m='45000'>let's say two. The dependent variables are</span> <span m='48000'>going
  to be, I will call them x and y, and then the first order</span> <span m='53000'>system,
  something involving just first derivatives,</span> <span m='57000'>will look like
  this. On the left-hand side</span> <span m='62000'>will be x prime,</span> <span
  m='64000'>in other words. On the right-hand side will be</span> <span m='67000'>the
  dependent variables and then also the independent variables.</span> </p><p><span
  m='72000'>I will indicate that, I will separate it all from the</span> <span m='76000'>others
  by putting a semicolon there.</span> </p><p><span m='78000'>And the same way y prime,
  the derivative of y with</span> <span m='82000'>respect to t, will be some other
  function of</span> <span m='85000'>(x, y) and t. Let's write down explicitly</span>
  <span m='90000'>that x and y are dependent variables.</span> </p><p><span m='97000'>And
  what they depend upon is the independent variable t,</span> <span m='101000'>time.
  A system like this is going to</span> <span m='103000'>be called first order. And
  we are going to consider</span> <span m='107000'>basically only first-order systems
  for a secret reason that</span> <span m='112000'>I will explain at the end of the
  period.</span> </p><p><span m='116000'>This is a first-order system, meaning that
  the only kind of</span> <span m='120000'>derivatives that are up here are first
  derivatives.</span> </p><p><span m='124000'>So x prime is dx over dt and so on.</span>
  </p><p><span m='128000'>Now, there is still more terminology.</span> </p><p><span
  m='130000'>Of course, practically all the equations after the term</span> <span
  m='135000'>started, virtually all the equations we have been</span> <span m='138000'>considering
  are linear equations, so it must be true</span> <span m='142000'>that linear systems
  are the best kind.</span> </p><p><span m='145000'>And, boy, they certainly are.
  When are we going to call a</span> <span m='151000'>system linear? I think in the
  beginning you</span> <span m='154000'>should learn a little terminology before we
  launch in</span> <span m='159000'>and actually try to start to solve these things.</span>
  </p><p><span m='163000'>Well, the x and y, the dependent variables must</span> <span
  m='166000'>occur linearly. In other words,</span> <span m='169000'>it must look
  like this, ax plus by.</span> </p><p><span m='173000'>Now, the t can be a mess.
  And so I will throw in an extra</span> <span m='178000'>function of t there. And
  y prime will be some</span> <span m='183000'>other linear combination of x and y,
  plus some other messy</span> <span m='188000'>function of t. But even the a,</span>
  <span m='190000'>b, c, and d are allowed to be functions of t.</span> </p><p><span
  m='194000'>They could be one over t cubed or sine t</span> <span m='199000'>or something
  like that. So I have to distinguish those</span> <span m='203000'>cases. The case
  where a,</span> <span m='205000'>b, c, and d are constants, that I will call --</span>
  <span m='210000'>Well, there are different things you can call it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='214000'>We will simply call it a constant coefficient system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='220000'>A system with coefficients would probably be better</span> <span m='225000'>English.
  On the other hand,</span> <span m='227000'>a, b, c, and d, this system will still
  be</span> <span m='231000'>called linear if these are functions of t.</span> </p><p><span
  m='236000'>Can also be functions of t.</span> </p><p><span m='245000'>So it would
  be a perfectly good linear system to have x prime</span> <span m='248000'>equals
  tx plus sine t times y plus e to the minus t squared.</span> </p><p><span m='255000'>You
  would never see something like that but it is okay.</span> </p><p><span m='258000'>What
  else do you need to know? Well, what would a homogenous</span> <span m='262000'>system
  be? A homogenous system is one</span> <span m='264000'>without these extra guys.
  That doesn't mean there is no t</span> <span m='268000'>in it. There could be t
  in the a,</span> <span m='272000'>b, c and d, but these terms with no x and y in
  them must not</span> <span m='278000'>occur. So, a linear homogenous.</span> </p><p><span
  m='287000'>And that is the kind we are going to start studying first in</span> <span
  m='290000'>the same way when we studied higher order equations.</span> </p><p><span
  m='293000'>We studied first homogenous. You had to know how to solve</span> <span
  m='297000'>those first, and then you could learn how to solve the more</span> <span
  m='300000'>general kind. So linear homogenous means that</span> <span m='304000'>r1
  is zero and r2 is zero for all time.</span> </p><p><span m='307000'>They are identically
  zero. They are not there.</span> </p><p><span m='310000'>You don't see them. Have
  I left anything out?</span> </p><p><span m='313000'>Yes, the initial conditions.
  Since that is quite general,</span> <span m='318000'>let's talk about what would
  initial conditions look like?</span> </p><p><span m='328000'>Well, in a general
  way, the reason you have to have</span> <span m='331000'>initial conditions is to
  get values for the arbitrary</span> <span m='334000'>constants that appear in the
  solution.</span> </p><p><span m='337000'>The question is, how many arbitrary constants</span>
  <span m='340000'>are going to appear in the solutions of these equations?</span>
  </p><p><span m='343000'>Well, I will just give you the answer.</span> </p><p><span
  m='346000'>Two. The number of arbitrary</span> <span m='348000'>constants that appear
  is the total order of the system.</span> </p><p><span m='351000'>For example, if
  this were a second</span> <span m='353000'>derivative and this were a first derivative,
  I would expect three</span> <span m='358000'>arbitrary constants in the system --</span>
  <span m='362000'>-- because the total, the sum of two and one makes</span> <span
  m='365000'>three. So you must have as many</span> <span m='367000'>initial conditions
  as you have arbitrary constants in the</span> <span m='371000'>solution. And that,
  of course,</span> <span m='373000'>explains when we studied second-order equations,</span>
  <span m='377000'>we had to have two initial conditions.</span> </p><p><span m='379000'>I
  had to specify the initial starting point and the initial</span> <span m='384000'>velocity.
  And the reason we had to have</span> <span m='386000'>two conditions was because
  the general solution had two</span> <span m='390000'>arbitrary constants in it.
  The same thing happens here but</span> <span m='396000'>the answer is it is more
  natural, the conditions here are</span> <span m='400000'>more natural. I don't have
  to specify the</span> <span m='403000'>velocity. Why not?</span> </p><p><span m='404000'>Well,
  because an initial condition, of course,</span> <span m='408000'>would want me to
  say what the starting value of x is,</span> <span m='412000'>some number, and it
  will also want to know</span> <span m='415000'>what the starting value of y is at
  that same point.</span> </p><p><span m='420000'>Well, there are my two conditions.</span>
  </p><p><span m='422000'>And since this is going to have two arbitrary constants
  in it,</span> <span m='427000'>it is these initial conditions that will satisfy,</span>
  <span m='430000'>the arbitrary constants will have to be picked so as to</span>
  <span m='434000'>satisfy those initial conditions.</span> </p><p><span m='437000'>In
  some sense, the giving of initial</span> <span m='439000'>conditions for a system
  is a more natural activity than</span> <span m='443000'>giving the initial conditions
  of a second order system.</span> </p><p><span m='449000'>You don't have to be the
  least bit cleaver about it.</span> </p><p><span m='452000'>Anybody would give these
  two numbers.</span> </p><p><span m='455000'>Whereas, somebody faced with a second
  order system might</span> <span m='458000'>scratch his head. And, in fact,</span>
  <span m='460000'>there are other kinds of conditions.</span> </p><p><span m='463000'>There
  are boundary conditions you learned a little bit about</span> <span m='467000'>instead
  of initial conditions for a second order equation.</span> </p><p><span m='471000'>I
  cannot think of any more general terminology,</span> <span m='474000'>so it sounds
  like we are going to actually have to get to work.</span> </p><p><span m='480000'>Okay,
  let's get to work. I want to set up a system and</span> <span m='484000'>solve it.
  And since one of the things in</span> <span m='487000'>this course is supposed to
  be simple modeling,</span> <span m='490000'>it should be a system that models something.</span>
  </p><p><span m='493000'>In general, the kinds of models we are going to use when
  we</span> <span m='498000'>study systems are the same ones we used in studying just</span>
  <span m='502000'>first-order equations. Mixing, radioactive decay,</span> <span
  m='505000'>temperature, the motion of temperature.</span> </p><p><span m='510000'>Heat,
  heat conduction, in other words.</span> </p><p><span m='512000'>Diffusion. I have
  given you a diffusion</span> <span m='515000'>problem for your first homework on
  this subject.</span> </p><p><span m='519000'>What else did we do? That's all I can
  think of for</span> <span m='523000'>the moment, but I am sure they will occur to
  me.</span> </p><p><span m='526000'>When, out of those physical ideas, are we going
  to get a</span> <span m='530000'>system? The answer is,</span> <span m='532000'>whenever
  there are two of something that there was only</span> <span m='536000'>one of before.
  For example,</span> <span m='539000'>if I have mixing with two tanks where the fluid
  goes like that.</span> </p><p><span m='543000'>Say you want to have a big tank and
  a little tank here and you</span> <span m='547000'>want to put some stuff into the
  little tank so that it will get</span> <span m='550000'>mixed in the big tank without
  having to climb a big ladder and</span> <span m='554000'>stop and drop the stuff
  in. That will require two tanks,</span> <span m='557000'>the concentration of the
  substance in each tank,</span> <span m='560000'>therefore, that will require a system
  of equations rather than</span> <span m='564000'>just one. Or, to give something
  closer to</span> <span m='568000'>home, closer to this backboard, anyway, suppose
  you have dah,</span> <span m='573000'>dah, dah, don't groan, at least not audibly,</span>
  <span m='576000'>something that looks like that. And next to it put an EMF</span>
  <span m='580000'>there. That is just a first order.</span> </p><p><span m='583000'>That
  just leads to a single first order equation.</span> </p><p><span m='587000'>But
  suppose it is a two loop circuit.</span> </p><p><span m='598000'>Now I need a pair
  of equations. Each of these loops gives a</span> <span m='602000'>first order differential
  equation, but they have to be</span> <span m='606000'>solved simultaneously to find
  the current or the charges on</span> <span m='610000'>the condensers. And if I want
  a system of three</span> <span m='614000'>equations, throw in another loop.</span>
  </p><p><span m='616000'>Now, suppose I put in a coil instead.</span> </p><p><span
  m='619000'>What is this going to lead to? This is going to give me a</span> <span
  m='623000'>system of three equations of which this will be first order,</span> <span
  m='627000'>first order. And this will be second order</span> <span m='632000'>because
  it has a coil. You are up to that,</span> <span m='635000'>right? You've had coils,</span>
  <span m='637000'>inductance? Good.</span> </p><p><span m='639000'>So the whole thing
  is going to count as first-order,</span> <span m='643000'>first-order, second-order.</span>
  </p><p><span m='645000'>To find out how complicated it is, you have to add up the</span>
  <span m='650000'>orders. That is one and one,</span> <span m='652000'>and two. This
  is really fourth-order</span> <span m='655000'>stuff that we are talking about here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='660000'>We can expect it to be a little complicated.</span> </p><p><span
  m='663000'>Well, now let's take a modest little problem.</span> </p><p><span m='666000'>I
  am going to return to a problem we considered earlier in</span> <span m='670000'>the
  problem of heat conduction. I had forgotten whether it was</span> <span m='674000'>on
  the problem set or I did it in class, but I am choosing it</span> <span m='679000'>because
  it leads to something we will be able to solve.</span> </p><p><span m='683000'>And
  because it illustrates how to add a little sophistication</span> <span m='687000'>to
  something that was unsophisticated before.</span> </p><p><span m='692000'>A pot
  of water. External temperature Te of t.</span> </p><p><span m='695000'>I am talking
  about the</span> <span m='698000'>temperature of something. And what I am talking
  about the</span> <span m='703000'>temperature of will be an egg that is cooking
  inside,</span> <span m='707000'>but with a difference. This egg is not homogenous</span>
  <span m='711000'>inside. Instead it has a white and it</span> <span m='714000'>has
  a yolk in the middle. In other words,</span> <span m='719000'>it is a real egg and
  not a phony egg.</span> </p><p><span m='721000'>That is a small pot, or it is an
  ostrich egg.</span> </p><p><span m='724000'>[LAUGHTER] That is the yoke. The yolk
  is contained in a</span> <span m='728000'>little membrane inside. And there are
  little yucky</span> <span m='731000'>things that hold it in position. And we are
  going to let the</span> <span m='735000'>temperature of the yolk, if you can see
  in the back of</span> <span m='739000'>the room, be T1. That is the temperature
  of the</span> <span m='742000'>yolk. The temperature of the white,</span> <span
  m='745000'>which we will assume is uniform, is going to be T2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='750000'>Oh, that's the water bath. The temperature of the white is</span> <span
  m='754000'>T2, and then the temperature of the external water bath.</span> </p><p><span
  m='759000'>In other words, the reason for introducing two</span> <span m='762000'>variables
  instead of just the one variable for the overall</span> <span m='767000'>temperature
  of the egg we had is because egg white is liquid pure</span> <span m='772000'>protein,
  more or less, and the T1, the yolk has a lot</span> <span m='777000'>of fat and
  cholesterol and other stuff like that which is</span> <span m='781000'>supposed
  to be bad for you. It certainly has different</span> <span m='786000'>conducting.
  It is liquid,</span> <span m='787000'>at the beginning at any rate, but it certainly
  has different</span> <span m='791000'>constants of conductivity than the egg white
  would.</span> </p><p><span m='794000'>And the condition of heat through the shell
  of the egg</span> <span m='797000'>would be different from the conduction of heat
  through the</span> <span m='800000'>membrane that keeps the yoke together.</span>
  </p><p><span m='802000'>So it is quite reasonable to consider that the white and
  the</span> <span m='806000'>yolk will be at different temperatures and will have</span>
  <span m='809000'>different conductivity properties.</span> </p><p><span m='812000'>I
  am going to use Newton's laws but with this further</span> <span m='816000'>refinement.
  In other words,</span> <span m='818000'>introducing two temperatures. Whereas, before
  we only had one</span> <span m='823000'>temperature. But let's use Newton's law.</span>
  </p><p><span m='826000'>Let's see. The question is how does T1,</span> <span m='829000'>the
  temperature of the yolk, vary with time?</span> </p><p><span m='832000'>Well, the
  yolk is getting all its heat from the white.</span> </p><p><span m='837000'>Therefore,
  Newton's law of conduction will be some constant</span> <span m='841000'>of conductivity
  for the yolk times T2 minus T1.</span> </p><p><span m='848000'>The yolk does not
  know anything about the external temperature</span> <span m='852000'>of the water
  bath. It is completely surrounded,</span> <span m='855000'>snug and secure within
  itself. But how about the temperature</span> <span m='860000'>of the egg white?
  That gets heat and gives heat</span> <span m='863000'>to two sources, from the external
  water and</span> <span m='866000'>also from the internal yolk inside.</span> </p><p><span
  m='870000'>So you have to take into account both of those.</span> </p><p><span m='873000'>Its
  conduction of the heat through that membrane,</span> <span m='876000'>we will use
  the same a, which is going to be a times T1</span> <span m='880000'>minus T2. Remember
  the order in which you</span> <span m='884000'>have to write these is governed by
  the yolk outside to the</span> <span m='888000'>white. Therefore, that has to come</span>
  <span m='891000'>first when I write it in order that a be a positive constant.</span>
  </p><p><span m='895000'>But it is also getting heat from the water bath.</span>
  </p><p><span m='900000'>And, presumably, the conductivity through the</span> <span
  m='903000'>shell is different from what it is through this membrane around</span>
  <span m='908000'>the yolk. So I am going to call that by a</span> <span m='911000'>different
  constant. This is the conductivity</span> <span m='914000'>through the shell into
  the white.</span> </p><p><span m='917000'>And that is going to be T, the external
  temperature minus</span> <span m='921000'>the temperature of the egg white.</span>
  </p><p><span m='924000'>Here I have a system of equations because I want to make</span>
  <span m='928000'>two dependent variables by refining the original problem.</span>
  </p><p><span m='934000'>Now, you always have to write a system in standard form
  to solve</span> <span m='939000'>it. You will see that the left-hand</span> <span
  m='942000'>side will give the dependent variables in a certain order.</span> </p><p><span
  m='947000'>In this case, the temperature of the yolk and</span> <span m='951000'>then
  the temperature of the white.</span> </p><p><span m='954000'>The law is that in
  order not to make mistakes --</span> <span m='960000'>And it's a very frequent source
  of error so learn from the</span> <span m='963000'>beginning not to do this. You
  must write the variables on</span> <span m='967000'>the right-hand side in the same
  order left to right in which</span> <span m='971000'>they occur top to bottom here.
  In other words,</span> <span m='974000'>this is not a good way to leave that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='976000'>This is the first attempt in writing this system,</span>
  <span m='980000'>but the final version should like this.</span> </p><p><span m='982000'>T1
  prime, I won't bother writing dT / dt,</span> <span m='985000'>is equal to -- T1
  must come first,</span> <span m='989000'>so minus a times T1 plus a times T2.</span>
  </p><p><span m='994000'>And the same law for the second one.</span> </p><p><span
  m='998000'>It must come in the same order. Now, the coefficient of T1,</span> <span
  m='1004000'>that is easy. That's a times T1.</span> </p><p><span m='1007000'>The
  coefficient of T2 is minus a minus b,</span> <span m='1012000'>so minus (a plus
  b) times T2.</span> </p><p><span m='1016000'>But I am not done yet. There is still
  this external</span> <span m='1022000'>temperature I must put into the equation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1026000'>Now, that is not a variable. This is some given function
  of</span> <span m='1031000'>t. And what the function of t is,</span> <span m='1034000'>of
  course, depends upon what the problem is.</span> </p><p><span m='1038000'>So that,
  for example, what might be some</span> <span m='1042000'>possibilities, well, suppose
  the problem was I</span> <span m='1046000'>wanted to coddle the egg. I think there
  is a generation</span> <span m='1052000'>gap here. How many of you know what a</span>
  <span m='1055000'>coddled egg is? How many of you don't know?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1058000'>Well, I'm just saying my daughter didn't know.</span> </p><p><span m='1062000'>I
  mentioned it to her. I said I think I'm going to do</span> <span m='1066000'>a coddled
  egg tomorrow in class. And she said what is that?</span> </p><p><span m='1071000'>And
  so I said a cuddled egg? She said why would someone</span> <span m='1075000'>cuddle
  an egg? I said coddle.</span> </p><p><span m='1079000'>And she said, oh, you mean
  like a person,</span> <span m='1082000'>like what you do to somebody you like or
  don't like or I</span> <span m='1087000'>don't know. Whatever.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1089000'>I thought a while and said, yeah, more like that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1093000'>[LAUGHTER] Anyway, for the enrichment of your</span> <span m='1097000'>cooking
  skills, to coddle an egg,</span> <span m='1100000'>it is considered to produce a
  better quality product than</span> <span m='1105000'>boiling an egg. That is why
  people do it.</span> </p><p><span m='1110000'>You heat up the water to boiling,
  the egg should be at</span> <span m='1114000'>room temperature, and then you carefully
  lower</span> <span m='1117000'>the egg into the water. And you turn off the heat
  so</span> <span m='1121000'>the water bath cools exponentially while the egg</span>
  <span m='1125000'>inside is rising in temperature. And then you wait four minutes</span>
  <span m='1130000'>or six minutes or whatever and take it out.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1133000'>You have a perfect egg. So for coddling,</span> <span m='1136000'>spelled
  so, what will the external temperature be?</span> </p><p><span m='1142000'>Well,
  it starts out at time zero at 100 degrees centigrade</span> <span m='1146000'>because
  the water is supposed to be boiling.</span> </p><p><span m='1149000'>The reason
  you have it boiling is for calibration so that you</span> <span m='1153000'>can
  know what temperature it is without having to use a</span> <span m='1157000'>thermometer,
  unless you're on Pike's Peak or some place.</span> </p><p><span m='1160000'>It starts
  out at 100 degrees. And after that,</span> <span m='1164000'>since the light is
  off, it cools exponential because</span> <span m='1167000'>that is another law.
  You only have to know what K is</span> <span m='1172000'>for your particular pot
  and you will be able to solve the</span> <span m='1177000'>coddled egg problem.
  In other words,</span> <span m='1180000'>you will then be able to solve these equations
  and know how the</span> <span m='1185000'>temperature rises. I am going to solve
  a different</span> <span m='1189000'>problem because I don't want to have to deal
  with this</span> <span m='1194000'>inhomogeneous term. Let's use, as a different</span>
  <span m='1198000'>problem, a person cooks an egg. Coddles the egg by the first</span>
  <span m='1204000'>process, decides the egg is done, let's say hardboiled,</span>
  <span m='1209000'>and then you are supposed to drop a hardboiled egg into cold</span>
  <span m='1214000'>water. Not just to cool it but also</span> <span m='1217000'>because
  I think it prevents that dark thing from forming that</span> <span m='1223000'>looks
  sort of unattractive. Let's ice bath.</span> </p><p><span m='1228000'>The only reason
  for dropping the egg into an ice bath is so</span> <span m='1232000'>that you could
  have a homogenous equation to solve.</span> </p><p><span m='1236000'>And since this
  a first system we are going to solve,</span> <span m='1240000'>let's make life easy
  for ourselves.</span> </p><p><span m='1243000'>Now, all my work in preparing this
  example,</span> <span m='1247000'>and it took considerably longer time than actually
  solving the</span> <span m='1252000'>problem, was in picking values for a and b
  which would make</span> <span m='1256000'>everything come out nice. It's harder
  than it looks.</span> </p><p><span m='1262000'>The values that we are going to use,
  which make no physical</span> <span m='1267000'>sense whatsoever, but a equals 2
  and b</span> <span m='1271000'>equals 3. These are called nice numbers.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1275000'>What is the equation? What is the system?</span> </p><p><span m='1278000'>Can
  somebody read it off for me?</span> </p><p><span m='1281000'>It is T1 prime equals,
  what is it, minus 2T1 plus 2T2.</span> </p><p><span m='1286000'>That's good.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1290000'>Minus 2T1 plus 2T2.</span> </p><p><span m='1300000'>T2
  prime is, what is it?</span> </p><p><span m='1302000'>I think this is 2T1. And the
  other one is minus a</span> <span m='1308000'>plus b, so minus 5.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1311000'>This is a system. Now, on Wednesday I will teach</span> <span m='1317000'>you
  a fancy way of solving this. But, to be honest,</span> <span m='1323000'>the fancy
  way will take roughly about as long as the way I am</span> <span m='1327000'>going
  to do it now. The main reason for doing it is</span> <span m='1330000'>that it introduces
  new vocabulary which everyone wants</span> <span m='1334000'>you to have. And also,
  more important</span> <span m='1336000'>reasons, it gives more insight into the
  solution than this</span> <span m='1340000'>method. This method just produces the</span>
  <span m='1342000'>answer, but you want insight, also.</span> </p><p><span m='1344000'>And
  that is just as important. But for now,</span> <span m='1348000'>let's use a method
  which always works and which in 40 years,</span> <span m='1353000'>after you have
  forgotten all other fancy methods,</span> <span m='1356000'>will still be available
  to you because it is method you can</span> <span m='1360000'>figure out yourself.
  You don't have to remember</span> <span m='1363000'>anything. The method is to eliminate
  one</span> <span m='1366000'>of the dependent variables. It is just the way you
  solve</span> <span m='1370000'>systems of linear equations in general if you aren't
  doing</span> <span m='1374000'>something fancy with determinants and matrices.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1379000'>If you just eliminate variables.</span> </p><p><span m='1381000'>We
  are going to eliminate one of these variables.</span> </p><p><span m='1385000'>Let's
  eliminate T2. You could also eliminate T1.</span> </p><p><span m='1388000'>The main
  thing is eliminate one of them so you will have just</span> <span m='1393000'>one
  left to work with. How do I eliminate T2?</span> </p><p><span m='1396000'>Beg your
  pardon? Is something wrong?</span> </p><p><span m='1399000'>If somebody thinks something
  is wrong raise his hand.</span> </p><p><span m='1403000'>No?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1410000'>Why do I want to get rid of T1? Well, I can add them.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1413000'>But, on the left-hand side, I will have T1 prime plus T2</span> <span
  m='1416000'>prime. What good is that?</span> </p><p><span m='1419000'>[LAUGHTER]</span>
  <span m='1428000'>I think you will want to do it my way.</span> </p><p><span m='1429000'>[APPLAUSE]</span>
  <span m='1443000'>Solve for T2 in terms of T1. That is going to be T1 prime</span>
  <span m='1448000'>plus 2T1 divided by 2.</span> </p><p><span m='1452000'>Now, take
  that and substitute it into the second equation.</span> </p><p><span m='1458000'>Wherever
  you see a T2, put that in,</span> <span m='1461000'>and what you will be left with
  is something just in T1.</span> </p><p><span m='1468000'>To be honest, I don't know
  any other good way</span> <span m='1471000'>of doing this. There is a fancy method
  that I</span> <span m='1474000'>think is talked about in your book, which leads
  to extraneous</span> <span m='1479000'>solutions and so on, but you don't want to
  know</span> <span m='1483000'>about that. This will work for a simple</span> <span
  m='1486000'>linear equation with constant coefficients,</span> <span m='1489000'>always.
  Substitute in.</span> </p><p><span m='1491000'>What do I do? Now, here I do not
  advise doing</span> <span m='1494000'>this mentally. It is just too easy to make
  a</span> <span m='1497000'>mistake. Here, I will do it carefully,</span> <span m='1504000'>writing
  everything out just as you would.</span> </p><p><span m='1510000'>T1 prime plus
  2T1 over 2, prime, equals 2T1 minus 5 time</span> <span m='1518000'>T1 prime plus
  2T1 over two.</span> </p><p><span m='1527000'>I took that and substituted</span>
  <span m='1532000'>into this equation. Now, I don't like those two's.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1538000'>Let's get rid of them by multiplying.</span> </p><p><span m='1542000'>This
  will become 4.</span> </p><p><span m='1552000'>And now write this out. What is this
  when you look at</span> <span m='1557000'>it? This is an equation just in T1.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1560000'>It has constant coefficients. And what is its order?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1565000'>Its order is two because T1 prime primed.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1570000'>In other words, I can eliminate T2 okay,</span> <span m='1573000'>but
  the equation I am going to get is no longer a first-order.</span> </p><p><span m='1579000'>It
  becomes a second-order differential equation.</span> </p><p><span m='1584000'>And
  that's a basic law. Even if you have a system of</span> <span m='1590000'>more equations,
  three or four or whatever,</span> <span m='1593000'>the law is that after you do
  the elimination successfully and</span> <span m='1597000'>end up with a single equation,
  normally the order of that</span> <span m='1602000'>equation will be the sum of
  the orders of the things you started</span> <span m='1606000'>with. So two first-order
  equations</span> <span m='1609000'>will always produce a second-order equation in
  just</span> <span m='1613000'>one dependent variable, three will produce a third</span>
  <span m='1616000'>order equation and so on. So you trade one complexity for</span>
  <span m='1622000'>another. You trade the complexity of</span> <span m='1624000'>having
  to deal with two equations simultaneously instead</span> <span m='1629000'>of just
  one for the complexity of having to deal with a single</span> <span m='1633000'>higher
  order equation which is more trouble to solve.</span> </p><p><span m='1637000'>It
  is like all mathematical problems.</span> </p><p><span m='1640000'>Unless you are
  very lucky, if you push them down one way,</span> <span m='1644000'>they are really
  simple now, they just pop up some place</span> <span m='1648000'>else. You say,
  oh,</span> <span m='1650000'>I didn't save anything after all.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1652000'>That is the law of conservation of mathematical difficulty.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1656000'>[LAUGHTER] You saw that even with the Laplace transform.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1660000'>In the beginning it looks great, you've got these tables,</span> <span
  m='1664000'>take the equation, horrible to solve.</span> </p><p><span m='1666000'>Take
  some transform, trivial to solve for capital Y.</span> </p><p><span m='1670000'>Now
  I have to find the inverse Laplace transform.</span> </p><p><span m='1673000'>And
  suddenly all the work is there, partial fractions,</span> <span m='1677000'>funny
  formulas and so on. It is very hard in mathematics</span> <span m='1682000'>to get
  away with something. It happens now and then and</span> <span m='1686000'>everybody
  cheers. Let's write this out now in the</span> <span m='1689000'>form in which it
  looks like an equation we can actually solve.</span> </p><p><span m='1693000'>Just
  be careful. Now it is all right to use the</span> <span m='1697000'>method by which
  you collect terms.</span> </p><p><span m='1699000'>There is only one term involving
  T1 double prime.</span> </p><p><span m='1703000'>It's the one that comes from here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1705000'>How about the terms in T1 prime?</span> </p><p><span m='1707000'>There
  is a 2. Here, there is minus 5 T1</span> <span m='1713000'>prime. If I put it on
  the other side</span> <span m='1717000'>it makes plus 5 T1 prime plus this two makes
  7 T1 prime.</span> </p><p><span m='1724000'>And how many T1's are there? Well, none
  on the left-hand</span> <span m='1731000'>side. On the right-hand side I have 4</span>
  <span m='1735000'>here minus 10. 4 minus 10 is negative 6.</span> </p><p><span m='1742000'>Negative
  6 T1 put on this left-hand side the way we want</span> <span m='1746000'>to do makes
  plus 6 T1.</span> </p><p><span m='1755000'>There are no inhomogeneous terms, so
  that is equal to zero.</span> </p><p><span m='1758000'>If I had gotten a negative
  number for one of these</span> <span m='1762000'>coefficients, I would instantly
  know if I had</span> <span m='1765000'>made a mistake. Why?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1766000'>Why must those numbers come out to be positive?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1770000'>It is because the system must be, the system must be,</span> <span m='1773000'>fill
  in with one word, stable.</span> </p><p><span m='1776000'>And why must this system
  be stable?</span> </p><p><span m='1778000'>In other words, the long-term solutions
  must be</span> <span m='1782000'>zero, must all go to zero, whatever they are.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1785000'>Why is that? Well, because you are putting</span> <span
  m='1788000'>the egg into an ice bath. Or, because we know it was</span> <span m='1792000'>living
  but after being hardboiled it is dead and,</span> <span m='1796000'>therefore, dead
  systems are stable.</span> </p><p><span m='1800000'>That's not a good reason but
  it is, so to speak,</span> <span m='1803000'>the real one. It's clear anyway that
  all</span> <span m='1805000'>solutions must tend to zero physically.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1808000'>That's obvious. And, therefore,</span> <span m='1810000'>the differential
  equation must have the same property,</span> <span m='1814000'>and that means that
  its coefficients must be positive.</span> </p><p><span m='1817000'>All its coefficients
  must be positive.</span> </p><p><span m='1820000'>If this weren't there, I would
  get oscillating</span> <span m='1823000'>solutions, which wouldn't go to zero.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1825000'>That is physical impossible for this egg.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1830000'>Now the rest is just solving. The characteristic equation,</span> <span
  m='1834000'>if you can remember way, way back in prehistoric times</span> <span
  m='1839000'>when we were solving these equations, is this.</span> </p><p><span m='1843000'>And
  what you want to do is factor it.</span> </p><p><span m='1846000'>This is where
  all the work was, getting those numbers so that</span> <span m='1851000'>this would
  factor. So it's r plus 1 times r plus 6</span> <span m='1864000'>And so the solutions
  are, the roots are r equals</span> <span m='1867000'>negative 1. I am just making
  marks on the</span> <span m='1870000'>board, but you have done this often enough,</span>
  <span m='1873000'>you know what I am talking about.</span> </p><p><span m='1875000'>So
  the characteristic roots are those two numbers.</span> </p><p><span m='1878000'>And,
  therefore, the solution is,</span> <span m='1880000'>I could write down immediately
  with its arbitrary constant as</span> <span m='1884000'>c1 times e to the negative
  t plus c2 times e to the negative</span> <span m='1888000'>6t. Now, I have got to
  get T2.</span> </p><p><span m='1894000'>Here the first worry is T2 is going to give
  me two more</span> <span m='1899000'>arbitrary constants. It better not.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1902000'>The system is only allowed to have two arbitrary constants
  in</span> <span m='1907000'>its solution because that is the initial conditions
  we are giving</span> <span m='1912000'>it. By the way, I forgot to give</span> <span
  m='1915000'>initial conditions. Let's give initial conditions.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1921000'>Let's say the initial temperature of the yolk,</span> <span m='1925000'>when
  it is put in the ice bath, is 40 degrees centigrade,</span> <span m='1930000'>Celsius.
  And T2, let's say the white</span> <span m='1933000'>ought to be a little hotter
  than the yolk is always cooler than</span> <span m='1938000'>the white for a soft
  boiled egg, I don't know,</span> <span m='1942000'>or a hardboiled egg if it hasn't
  been chilled too long.</span> </p><p><span m='1947000'>Let's make this 45. Realistic
  numbers.</span> </p><p><span m='1952000'>Now, the thing not to do is to say, hey,
  I found T1.</span> </p><p><span m='1955000'>Okay, I will find T2 by the same procedure.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1959000'>I will go through the whole thing.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1961000'>I will eliminate T1 instead. Then I will end up with an</span> <span
  m='1965000'>equation T2 and I will solve that and get T2 equals blah,</span> <span
  m='1970000'>blah, blah. That is no good,</span> <span m='1972000'>A, because you
  are working too hard and, B, because you are</span> <span m='1976000'>going to get
  two more arbitrary constants unrelated to these</span> <span m='1981000'>two. And
  that is no good.</span> </p><p><span m='1984000'>Because the correct solution only
  has two constants in it.</span> </p><p><span m='1989000'>Not four. So that procedure
  is wrong.</span> </p><p><span m='1992000'>You must calculate T2 from the T1 that
  you found,</span> <span m='1995000'>and that is the equation which does it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1998000'>That's the one we have to have. Where is the chalk?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2002000'>Yes. Maybe I can have a little thing</span> <span m='2005000'>so
  I can just carry this around with me.</span> </p><p><span m='2017000'>That is the
  relation between T2 and T1.</span> </p><p><span m='2020000'>Or, if you don't like
  it, either one of these equations</span> <span m='2024000'>will express T2 in terms
  of T1 for you.</span> </p><p><span m='2027000'>It doesn't matter. Whichever one
  you use,</span> <span m='2030000'>however you do it, that's the way you must</span>
  <span m='2033000'>calculate T2. So what is it?</span> </p><p><span m='2036000'>T2
  is calculated from that pink box.</span> </p><p><span m='2040000'>It is one-half
  of T1 prime plus T1.</span> </p><p><span m='2045000'>Now, if I take the derivative
  of this, I get minus c1 times</span> <span m='2051000'>the exponential. The coefficient
  is minus c1,</span> <span m='2056000'>take half of that, that is minus a half c1</span>
  <span m='2061000'>and add it to T1. Minus one-half c1 plus c1 gives</span> <span
  m='2066000'>me one-half c1.</span> </p><p><span m='2072000'>And here I take the
  derivative, it is minus 6 c2.</span> </p><p><span m='2078000'>Take half of that,
  minus 3 c2 and add this c2 to</span> <span m='2084000'>it, minus 3 plus 1 makes
  minus 2.</span> </p><p><span m='2088000'>That is T2. And notice it uses the same</span>
  <span m='2093000'>arbitrary constants that T1 uses.</span> </p><p><span m='2099000'>So
  we end up with just two because we calculated T2 from</span> <span m='2102000'>that
  formula or from the equation which is equivalent to</span> <span m='2106000'>it,
  not from scratch. We haven't put in the initial</span> <span m='2109000'>conditions
  yet, but that is easy to do.</span> </p><p><span m='2111000'>Everybody, when working
  with exponentials,</span> <span m='2114000'>of course, you always want the initial
  conditions to be when T</span> <span m='2118000'>is equal to zero because that makes
  all the</span> <span m='2121000'>exponentials one and you don't have to worry about
  them.</span> </p><p><span m='2125000'>But this you know. If I put in the initial</span>
  <span m='2127000'>conditions, at time zero, T1 has the value 40.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2132000'>So 40 should be equal to c1 + c2.</span> </p><p><span m='2138000'>And
  the other equation will say that 45 is equal to one-half c1</span> <span m='2145000'>minus
  2 c2. Now we are supposed to</span> <span m='2152000'>solve these. Well, this is
  called solving</span> <span m='2157000'>simultaneous linear equations. We could
  use Kramer's rule,</span> <span m='2165000'>inverse matrices, but why don't we just</span>
  <span m='2169000'>eliminate. Let me see.</span> </p><p><span m='2172000'>If I multiply
  by, 45, so multiply by two,</span> <span m='2177000'>you get 90 equals c1 minus
  4 c2.</span> </p><p><span m='2183000'>Then subtract this guy from that guy.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2187000'>So, 40 taken from 90 makes 50. And c1 taken from c1,</span>
  <span m='2195000'>because I multiplied by two, makes zero.</span> </p><p><span m='2200000'>And
  c2 taken from minus 4 c2, that makes minus 5 c2,</span> <span m='2207000'>I guess.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2209000'>I seem to get c2 is equal to negative 10.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2216000'>And if c2 is negative 10, then c1 must be 50.</span> </p><p><span m='2224000'>There
  are two ways of checking the answer.</span> </p><p><span m='2227000'>One is to plug
  it into the equations, and the other is to</span> <span m='2233000'>peak. Yes, that's
  right.</span> </p><p><span m='2235000'>[LAUGHTER]</span> <span m='2245000'>The final
  answer is, in other words,</span> <span m='2247000'>you put a 50 here, 25 there,
  negative 10 here,</span> <span m='2250000'>and positive 20 there. That gives the
  answer to the</span> <span m='2254000'>problem. It tells you,</span> <span m='2255000'>in
  other words, how the temperature of the yolk</span> <span m='2259000'>varies with
  time and how the temperature of the white varies</span> <span m='2263000'>with time.
  As I said, we are going to</span> <span m='2266000'>learn a slick way of doing this
  problem, or at least a very</span> <span m='2271000'>different way of doing the
  same problem next time,</span> <span m='2274000'>but let's put that on ice for the
  moment.</span> </p><p><span m='2277000'>And instead I would like to spend the rest
  of the period</span> <span m='2281000'>doing for first order systems the same thing
  that I did for</span> <span m='2285000'>you the very first day of the term.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2289000'>Remember, I walked in assuming that you knew how to separate</span>
  <span m='2293000'>variables the first day of the term, and I did not talk to you</span>
  <span m='2297000'>about how to solve fancier equations by fancier methods.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2301000'>I instead talked to you about the geometric significance,</span>
  <span m='2305000'>what the geometric meaning of a single first order equation was</span>
  <span m='2309000'>and how that geometric meaning enabled you to solve it</span>
  <span m='2313000'>numerically. And we spent a little while</span> <span m='2316000'>working
  on such problems because nowadays with computers it is</span> <span m='2320000'>really
  important that you get a feeling for what these things</span> <span m='2324000'>mean
  as opposed to just algorithms for solving them.</span> </p><p><span m='2327000'>As
  I say, most differential equations, especially systems,</span> <span m='2330000'>are
  likely to be solved by a computer anyway.</span> </p><p><span m='2334000'>You have
  to be the guiding genius that interprets the</span> <span m='2337000'>answers and
  can see when mistakes are being made,</span> <span m='2341000'>stuff like that.
  The problem is,</span> <span m='2344000'>therefore, what is the meaning of this
  system?</span> </p><p><span m='2355000'>Well, you are not going to get anywhere
  interpreting it</span> <span m='2358000'>geometrically, unless you get rid of that
  t on</span> <span m='2361000'>the right-hand side. And the only way of getting rid</span>
  <span m='2365000'>of the t is to declare it is not there.</span> </p><p><span m='2368000'>So
  I hereby declare that I will only consider,</span> <span m='2371000'>for the rest
  of the period, that is only ten minutes,</span> <span m='2374000'>systems in which
  no t appears explicitly on the right-hand</span> <span m='2378000'>side. Because
  I don't know what to do</span> <span m='2382000'>if it does up here. We have a word
  for these.</span> </p><p><span m='2385000'>Remember what the first order word was?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2388000'>A first order equation where there was no t explicitly
  on the</span> <span m='2393000'>right-hand side, we called it,</span> <span m='2395000'>anybody
  remember? Just curious.</span> </p><p><span m='2397000'>Autonomous, right.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2405000'>This is an autonomous system. It is not a linear system</span>
  <span m='2408000'>because these are messy functions.</span> </p><p><span m='2410000'>This
  could be x times y or x squared minus 3y squared</span> <span m='2414000'>divided
  by sine of x plus y.</span> </p><p><span m='2418000'>It could be a mess. Definitely
  not linear.</span> </p><p><span m='2421000'>But autonomous means no t. t means the
  independent</span> <span m='2424000'>variable appears on the right-hand side.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2427000'>Of course, it is there. It is buried in the dx/dt and</span>
  <span m='2430000'>dy/dt. But it is not on the right-hand</span> <span m='2433000'>side.
  No t appears on the right-hand</span> <span m='2435000'>side.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2441000'>Because no t appears on the right-hand side,</span> <span m='2444000'>I
  can now draw a picture of this.</span> </p><p><span m='2447000'>But, let's see,
  what does a solution look like?</span> </p><p><span m='2452000'>I never even talked
  about what a solution was,</span> <span m='2456000'>did I? Well, pretend that immediately</span>
  <span m='2459000'>after I talked about that, I talked about this.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2465000'>What is the solution? Well, the solution,</span> <span m='2467000'>maybe
  you took it for granted, is a pair of functions,</span> <span m='2470000'>x of t,
  y of t if when you plug it in</span> <span m='2473000'>it satisfies the equation.
  And so what else is new?</span> </p><p><span m='2476000'>The solution is x equals
  x of t,</span> <span m='2479000'>y equals y of t.</span> </p><p><span m='2487000'>If
  I draw a picture of that what would it look like?</span> </p><p><span m='2490000'>This
  is where your previous knowledge of physics above all</span> <span m='2495000'>18.02,
  maybe 18.01 if you learned this in high school,</span> <span m='2499000'>what is
  x equals x of t and y equals y of t?</span> </p><p><span m='2504000'>How do you
  draw a picture of</span> <span m='2507000'>that? What does it represent?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2509000'>A curve. And what will be the title of</span> <span m='2512000'>the
  chapter of the calculus book in which that is discussed?</span> </p><p><span m='2516000'>Parametric
  equations. This is a parameterized curve.</span> </p><p><span m='2532000'>So we
  know what the solution looks like.</span> </p><p><span m='2535000'>Our solution
  is a parameterized curve.</span> </p><p><span m='2538000'>And what does a parameterized
  curve look like?</span> </p><p><span m='2541000'>Well, it travels, and in a certain
  direction.</span> </p><p><span m='2554000'>Okay. That's enough.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2555000'>Why do I have several of those curves?</span> </p><p><span m='2558000'>Well,
  because I have several solutions.</span> </p><p><span m='2560000'>In fact, given
  any initial starting point,</span> <span m='2563000'>there is a solution that goes
  through it.</span> </p><p><span m='2566000'>I will put in possible starting points.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2569000'>And you can do this on the computer screen with a little</span>
  <span m='2573000'>program you will have, one of the visuals you'll have.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2576000'>It's being made right now. You put down starter point,</span>
  <span m='2581000'>put down a click, and then it just draws the</span> <span m='2584000'>curve
  passing through that point.</span> </p><p><span m='2586000'>Didn't we do this early
  in the term?</span> </p><p><span m='2589000'>Yes. But there is a difference now</span>
  <span m='2591000'>which I will explain. These are various possible</span> <span
  m='2594000'>starting points at time zero for this solution,</span> <span m='2597000'>and
  then you see what happens to it afterwards.</span> </p><p><span m='2600000'>In fact,
  through every point in the plane will pass a solution</span> <span m='2605000'>curve,
  parameterized curve. Now, what is then the</span> <span m='2609000'>representation
  of this? Well, what is the meaning of x</span> <span m='2612000'>prime of t and
  y prime of t?</span> </p><p><span m='2620000'>I am not going to worry for the moment
  about the right-hand</span> <span m='2624000'>side. What does this mean by itself?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2627000'>If this is the curve, the parameterized motion,</span>
  <span m='2630000'>then this represents its velocity vector.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2633000'>It is the velocity of the solution at time t.</span> </p><p><span m='2638000'>If
  I think of the solution as being a parameterized motion.</span> </p><p><span m='2643000'>All
  I have drawn here is the trace, the path of the motion.</span> </p><p><span m='2648000'>This
  hasn't indicated how fast it was going.</span> </p><p><span m='2651000'>One solution
  might go whoosh and another one might go rah.</span> </p><p><span m='2656000'>That
  is a velocity, and that velocity changes from</span> <span m='2660000'>point to
  point. It changes direction.</span> </p><p><span m='2663000'>Well, we know its direction
  at each point.</span> </p><p><span m='2667000'>That's tangent. What I cannot tell
  is the</span> <span m='2671000'>speed. From this picture,</span> <span m='2673000'>I
  cannot tell what the speed was.</span> </p><p><span m='2676000'>Too bad. Now, what
  is then the meaning</span> <span m='2679000'>of the system? What the system does,</span>
  <span m='2681000'>it prescribes at each point the velocity vector.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2685000'>If you tell me what the point (x, y) is in the plane then</span> <span
  m='2690000'>these equations give you the velocity vector at that point.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2694000'>And, therefore, what I end up with,</span> <span m='2697000'>the system
  is what you call in physics and what you call in</span> <span m='2701000'>18.02
  a velocity field. So at each point there is a</span> <span m='2706000'>certain vector.
  The vector is always tangent to</span> <span m='2709000'>the solution curve through
  there, but I cannot predict from</span> <span m='2713000'>just this picture what
  its length will be because at some</span> <span m='2717000'>points, it might be
  going slow. The solution might be going</span> <span m='2721000'>slowly. In other
  words,</span> <span m='2722000'>the plane is filled up with these guys.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2733000'>Stop me. Not enough here.</span> </p><p><span m='2737000'>So on and
  so on. We can say a system of first</span> <span m='2744000'>order equations, ODEs
  of first order equations,</span> <span m='2752000'>autonomous because there must
  be no t on the right-hand side,</span> <span m='2763000'>is equal to a velocity
  field. A field of velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='2772000'>The plane covered with
  velocity vectors.</span> </p><p><span m='2778000'>And a solution is a parameterized
  curve with the</span> <span m='2785000'>right velocity everywhere.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2798000'>Now, there obviously must be a connection between that and the</span>
  <span m='2859000'>direction fields we studied at the beginning of the term.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2916000'>And there is. It is a very important</span> <span m='2951000'>connection.
  It is too important to talk</span> <span m='2989000'>about in minus one minute.
  When we need it,</span> <span m='3032000'>I will have to spend some time talking
  about it then.</span> </p>
