transcript: "<p><span m='13000'>I just want to remind you of the main facts.</span>\
  \ <span m='16000'>The first thing that you have to do is, of course,</span> <span\
  \ m='19000'>we are going to have to be doing it several times today.</span> <span\
  \ m='23000'>That is the system we are trying to solve.</span> <span m='26000'>And\
  \ the first thing you have to do is find a characteristic</span> <span m='31000'>equation\
  \ which is general form, although this is not the form</span> <span m='35000'>you\
  \ should use for two-by-two, is A minus lambda I</span> <span m='39000'>equals zero.\
  \ And its roots are the</span> <span m='42000'>eigenvalues.</span> <span m='50000'>And\
  \ then with each eigenvalue you then have to calculate its</span> <span m='55000'>eigenvector,\
  \ which you do by solving the system (A minus</span> <span m='59000'>lambda1, let's\
  \ say, times I) alpha equals zero</span> <span m='64000'>because the solution is\
  \ the eigenvector</span> <span m='69000'>alpha 1. And then the final solution</span>\
  \ <span m='72000'>that you make out of the two of them looks like alpha 1 times\
  \ e</span> <span m='78000'>to the lambda 1t.</span> <span m='81000'>Of course you\
  \ do that for each eigenvalue.</span> <span m='85000'>You get the associated eigenvector.</span>\
  \ <span m='90000'>And then the general solution is made up out of a linear</span>\
  \ <span m='95000'>combination of these individual guys with constant coefficients.</span>\
  \ <span m='100000'>The lecture today is devoted to the two cases where things do</span>\
  \ <span m='106000'>not go as smoothly as they seem to in the homework problems you</span>\
  \ <span m='111000'>have been doing up until now. The first one will take</span>\
  \ <span m='116000'>probably most of the period. It deals with what happens when</span>\
  \ <span m='122000'>an eigenvalue gets repeated. But I think since the situation</span>\
  \ <span m='126000'>is a little more complicated than it is where the case of a</span>\
  \ <span m='130000'>characteristic root gets repeated in the case of a</span> <span\
  \ m='134000'>second-order equation as we saw it, you know what to do in that</span>\
  \ <span m='138000'>case, here there are different possibilities.</span> <span m='142000'>And\
  \ I thought the best thing to do would be to illustrate them</span> <span m='146000'>on\
  \ an example. So here is a problem.</span> <span m='150000'>It came out of a mild\
  \ nightmare, but I won't bore you</span> <span m='154000'>with the details. Anyway,\
  \ we have this circular</span> <span m='158000'>fish tank. It is a very modern fish\
  \ tank.</span> <span m='162000'>It is divided into three compartments because one\
  \ holds</span> <span m='167000'>Siamese fighting fish and one goldfish, and one--\
  \ They should</span> <span m='172000'>not eat each other. And it is going to be\
  \ a simple</span> <span m='177000'>temperature problem. The three actual compartments</span>\
  \ <span m='182000'>have to be kept at different temperatures because one is for</span>\
  \ <span m='186000'>tropical fish and one is for arctic fish and one is for</span>\
  \ <span m='190000'>everyday garden variety fish. But the guy forgets to turn on</span>\
  \ <span m='195000'>the heater so the temperatures start out what they are supposed</span>\
  \ <span m='199000'>to be, tropical, icy, and normal.</span> <span m='202000'>But\
  \ as the day wears on, of course, the three</span> <span m='205000'>compartments\
  \ trade their heat and sort of tend to all end up</span> <span m='210000'>at the\
  \ same temperature. So we are going to let (x)i</span> <span m='215000'>equal the\
  \ temperature in tank i. Now, these are separated from</span> <span m='220000'>each\
  \ other by glass things. Everything is identical,</span> <span m='224000'>each has\
  \ the same volume, and the same glass partition</span> <span m='228000'>separates\
  \ them out and no heat can escape.</span> <span m='231000'>This is very well-insulated\
  \ with very double-thick</span> <span m='235000'>Thermopane glass or something like\
  \ that.</span> <span m='240000'>You can see in, but heat cannot get out very</span>\
  \ <span m='243000'>well. Heat essentially is conducted</span> <span m='246000'>from\
  \ one of these cells to the other.</span> <span m='248000'>And let's assume that\
  \ the water in each tank is kept stirred up</span> <span m='253000'>because the\
  \ fish are swimming around in it.</span> <span m='257000'>That should be a pretty\
  \ decent way of stirring a fish tank.</span> <span m='261000'>The question is how\
  \ do each of these, as a function of time,</span> <span m='266000'>and I want to\
  \ know how they behave over time,</span> <span m='269000'>so find these functions.</span>\
  \ <span m='280000'>Well, we are going to find them in solutions to differential</span>\
  \ <span m='283000'>equations. And the differential equations</span> <span m='285000'>are\
  \ not hard to set up. They are very much like the</span> <span m='288000'>diffusion\
  \ equation you had for homework or the equations we</span> <span m='291000'>studied\
  \ in the beginning of the term.</span> <span m='293000'>Let's do one carefully because\
  \ the others go exactly the same</span> <span m='297000'>way. What determines the\
  \ flow,</span> <span m='299000'>the change in temperature? Well, it is the conductivity</span>\
  \ <span m='303000'>across the barriers. But there are two barriers</span> <span\
  \ m='306000'>because heat can flow into this first cell, both from this guy</span>\
  \ <span m='310000'>and it can flow across this glass pane from the other cell.</span>\
  \ <span m='314000'>We have to take account of both of those possibilities.</span>\
  \ <span m='317000'>It is like in your homework. The little diffusion cell that</span>\
  \ <span m='321000'>was in the middle could get contributions from both sides,</span>\
  \ <span m='325000'>whereas, the two guys on the end could only get contribution</span>\
  \ <span m='329000'>from one. But here, nobody is on the end.</span> <span m='334000'>It\
  \ is circular table. Everyone is dying equally.</span> <span m='338000'>Everybody\
  \ can get input from the other two cells.</span> <span m='343000'>x1 prime is some\
  \ constant of conductivity times</span> <span m='348000'>the temperature difference\
  \ between tank three and tank one.</span> <span m='354000'>And then there is another\
  \ term which comes from tank two.</span> <span m='361000'>So a times tank two minus\
  \ the temperature difference,</span> <span m='364000'>tank two minus tank one. Let's\
  \ write this out.</span> <span m='367000'>Remember there will be other equations,\
  \ too.</span> <span m='370000'>But instead of doing this, let's do a more careful\
  \ job</span> <span m='374000'>with this first equation. When I write it out,</span>\
  \ <span m='377000'>remember, the important thing is you are going to have x1,</span>\
  \ <span m='381000'>x2, x3 down the left, so they have to occur in the</span> <span\
  \ m='384000'>same order on the right in order to use these standard eigenvalue</span>\
  \ <span m='389000'>techniques. The coefficient of x1 is going</span> <span m='393000'>to\
  \ be minus a x1 and then another minus a x1.</span> <span m='398000'>In other words,\
  \ it is going to be minus 2 ax1.</span> <span m='402000'>And then the x2 term will\
  \ be plus a x2.</span> <span m='406000'>And the x3 term will be plus a x3.</span>\
  \ <span m='409000'>Well, you can see now that is the equation for x1 prime in</span>\
  \ <span m='415000'>terms of the other variables. But there is symmetry.</span> <span\
  \ m='420000'>There is no difference between this tank, that tank,</span> <span m='424000'>and\
  \ that tank as far as the differential equations are</span> <span m='428000'>concerned.\
  \ And, therefore,</span> <span m='430000'>I can get the equations for the other\
  \ two tanks by just changing</span> <span m='435000'>1 to 2, just switching the\
  \ subscripts.</span> <span m='438000'>When I finally do it all, the equations are\
  \ going to be,</span> <span m='442000'>I will write them first out as a system.</span>\
  \ <span m='447000'>Let's take a equal 1 because I am going to want to</span> <span\
  \ m='450000'>solve them numerically, and I want you to be able to</span> <span m='454000'>concentrate\
  \ on what is important, what is new now and</span> <span m='457000'>not fuss because\
  \ I don't want to have an extra a floating around</span> <span m='462000'>everywhere\
  \ just contributing nothing but a mild confusion to</span> <span m='465000'>the\
  \ proceedings. So x1 prime,</span> <span m='467000'>I am going to take a equal 1\
  \ and simply write it minus 2 x1</span> <span m='471000'>plus x2 plus x3.</span>\
  \ <span m='474000'>And so now what would the equation for x2 prime</span> <span\
  \ m='477000'>be? Well, here x2 plays the role</span> <span m='481000'>that x1 played\
  \ before. And the only way to tell that</span> <span m='485000'>x1 was the main\
  \ guy here was it occurred with a coefficient</span> <span m='490000'>negative 2,\
  \ whereas, the other guys occurred with</span> <span m='494000'>coefficient 1. That\
  \ must be what happens here,</span> <span m='498000'>too. Since x2 prime is our</span>\
  \ <span m='501000'>main man, this is minus x2 and this must be x1 here plus x3.</span>\
  \ <span m='506000'>And finally the last one is no different, x3 prime is x1 plus</span>\
  \ <span m='511000'>x2. And now it is the x3 that</span> <span m='515000'>should\
  \ get negative 2 for the coefficient.</span> <span m='518000'>There is a perfectly\
  \ reasonable-looking set of</span> <span m='522000'>equations. Just how reasonable\
  \ they are</span> <span m='525000'>depends upon what their characteristic polynomial\
  \ turns</span> <span m='529000'>out to be. And all the work in these</span> <span\
  \ m='532000'>problems is trying to find nice models where you won't have to</span>\
  \ <span m='537000'>use Matlab to calculate the roots, the eigenvalues,</span> <span\
  \ m='541000'>the roots of the characteristic polynomial.</span> <span m='546000'>So\
  \ we have to now find the characteristic polynomial.</span> <span m='549000'>The\
  \ matrix that we are talking about is the matrix,</span> <span m='553000'>well,\
  \ let's right away write A minus lambda I</span> <span m='557000'>I cannot use the\
  \ trace and</span> <span m='559000'>determinant form for this equation because it\
  \ is not a</span> <span m='563000'>two-by-two matrix. It is a three-by-three matrix.</span>\
  \ <span m='566000'>I have to use the original form for the characteristic equation.</span>\
  \ <span m='572000'>But what is this going to be? Well, what is A?</span> <span m='575000'>A\
  \ is minus 2. I am going to leave a little</span> <span m='578000'>space here. 1,\
  \ 1, 1 minus 2,</span> <span m='581000'>1. And finally 1,</span> <span m='582000'>1,\
  \ negative 2. subtract lambda from</span> <span m='588000'>the main diagonal, minus\
  \ 2 minus lambda</span> <span m='592000'>minus 2 minus lambda, minus 2 minus lambda.</span>\
  \ <span m='596000'>And now that equals zero is the characteristic equation.</span>\
  \ <span m='602000'>The term with the most lambdas in it is the main diagonal.</span>\
  \ <span m='606000'>That is always true, notice.</span> <span m='608000'>Now, each\
  \ of these I would be happier writing lambda plus 2,</span> <span m='612000'>so\
  \ there would be a negative sign, negative sign,</span> <span m='616000'>negative\
  \ sign. The product of three negative</span> <span m='619000'>signs is still a negative\
  \ sign because three is an odd number.</span> <span m='624000'>So it is minus the\
  \ principle term.</span> <span m='628000'>The product of these three is minus lambda\
  \ plus 2 cubed.</span> <span m='632000'>Now, the rest of the terms are</span> <span\
  \ m='636000'>going to be easy. There is another term 1 times 1</span> <span m='640000'>times\
  \ 1, another term 1 times 1 times 1.</span> <span m='643000'>So to that I add 2,\
  \ 1 and 1 for those two other</span> <span m='647000'>terms. And now I have the\
  \ three going</span> <span m='649000'>in this direction, but each one of them has\
  \ to be</span> <span m='653000'>prefaced with a minus sign. What does each one of\
  \ them come</span> <span m='658000'>to? Well, this is minus 2 minus</span> <span\
  \ m='661000'>lambda when I multiply those three numbers together.</span> <span m='665000'>And\
  \ so are the other guys. This is 1 times 1 times minus 2</span> <span m='669000'>minus\
  \ lambda, the same thing.</span> <span m='671000'>There are three of them. Minus\
  \ because they are going</span> <span m='675000'>this way, minus 3 because there\
  \ are three of them,</span> <span m='678000'>and what each one of them is is negative\
  \ 2 negative lambda.</span> <span m='682000'>That is equal to zero, and that is\
  \ the characteristic</span> <span m='686000'>equation. Now, it doesn't look very</span>\
  \ <span m='689000'>promising. On the other hand,</span> <span m='691000'>I have\
  \ selected it for the lecture.</span> <span m='693000'>Simple psychology should\
  \ tell you that it is going to come out</span> <span m='697000'>okay. What I am\
  \ going to do is expand</span> <span m='699000'>this. First imagine changing the</span>\
  \ <span m='701000'>sign. I hate to have a minus sign in</span> <span m='704000'>front\
  \ of a lambda cubed,</span> <span m='706000'>so let's make this plus and we will\
  \ make this minus and we will</span> <span m='710000'>make this plus. I will just\
  \ change all the</span> <span m='712000'>signs, which is okay since it is an equation\
  \ equals zero.</span> <span m='716000'>That doesn't change its roots any.</span>\
  \ <span m='720000'>And now we are going to expand it out.</span> <span m='722000'>What\
  \ is this? Lambda plus 2 cubed.</span> <span m='725000'>Lambda cubed plus,</span>\
  \ <span m='726000'>and don't get confused because it is this 2 that will kill you</span>\
  \ <span m='730000'>when you use the binomial theorem.</span> <span m='732000'>If\
  \ there is 1 here everybody knows what to do.</span> <span m='735000'>If there is\
  \ an A there everybody knows what to do.</span> <span m='738000'>It is when that\
  \ is a number not 1 that everybody makes mistakes,</span> <span m='742000'>including\
  \ me. The binomial coefficients are</span> <span m='745000'>1, 3, 3, 1 because it\
  \ is a cubed, I am expanding.</span> <span m='750000'>So it is lambda cubed plus\
  \ 3 times lambda squared times 2.</span> <span m='754000'>I won't explain to you\
  \ what I am doing.</span> <span m='757000'>I will just do it and hope that you all\
  \ know what I am doing.</span> <span m='761000'>Plus 3 times lambda times 2 squared\
  \ plus the last term,</span> <span m='765000'>which is 2 cubed.</span> <span m='769000'>And\
  \ now we have the other term.</span> <span m='773000'>All that is plus because I\
  \ changed its sign.</span> <span m='776000'>The next thing is negative 2. And then\
  \ the last thing is plus</span> <span m='783000'>3 times (minus 2 minus lambda).</span>\
  \ <span m='788000'>Let's keep it. So what is the actual</span> <span m='791000'>characteristic\
  \ equation? Maybe I can finish it.</span> <span m='795000'>I should stay over here\
  \ instead of recopying all of it.</span> <span m='807000'>Well, there is a lot more\
  \ work to do.</span> <span m='809000'>Let's see if we can at least write down the\
  \ equation.</span> <span m='813000'>What is it? It is lambda cubed.</span> <span\
  \ m='815000'>What is the lambda squared</span> <span m='818000'>erm? It is six and\
  \ that is all there</span> <span m='822000'>is. How about the lambda term?</span>\
  \ <span m='824000'>Well, we have 12 lambda minus 3 lambda which makes plus 9</span>\
  \ <span m='828000'>lambda. That looks good but constant</span> <span m='831000'>terms\
  \ have a way of screwing everything up.</span> <span m='834000'>What is the constant\
  \ term? It is A minus 2 minus 6.</span> <span m='840000'>Zero. The constant term\
  \ is zero.</span> <span m='842000'>That converts this from a hard problem to an\
  \ easy problem.</span> <span m='847000'>Now it is a cinch to calculate the stuff.</span>\
  \ <span m='851000'>Let's go to this board and continue the work over here.</span>\
  \ <span m='864000'>The equation is lambda cubed plus 6 lambda squared plus 9</span>\
  \ <span m='867000'>lambda is zero.</span> <span m='871000'>It is very easy to calculate\
  \ the roots of that.</span> <span m='874000'>You factor it. Lambda is a common factor.</span>\
  \ <span m='877000'>And what is left? Lambda squared plus 6 lambda</span> <span m='880000'>plus\
  \ 9.</span> <span m='883000'>That is the sort of thing you got all the time when\
  \ you were</span> <span m='887000'>studying critical damping. It is the square of\
  \ lambda plus</span> <span m='891000'>3. Lambda squared plus 6 lambda</span> <span\
  \ m='894000'>plus 9 equals zero. So the eigenvalues,</span> <span m='898000'>the\
  \ roots are what? Well, they are lambda equals</span> <span m='902000'>zero from\
  \ this factor and then lambda equals minus 3.</span> <span m='907000'>But what is\
  \ new is that the</span> <span m='910000'>minus 3 is a double root. That is a double\
  \ root.</span> <span m='914000'>Now, that, of course, is what is going to cause\
  \ the</span> <span m='918000'>trouble. Because, for each one of these,</span> <span\
  \ m='921000'>I am supposed to calculate the eigenvector and make up the</span> <span\
  \ m='926000'>solution. But that assumed that I had</span> <span m='929000'>three\
  \ things to get three different solutions.</span> <span m='932000'>Here I have only\
  \ got two things.</span> <span m='934000'>It is the same trouble we ran into when\
  \ there was a repeated</span> <span m='938000'>root. We were studying second or</span>\
  \ <span m='940000'>third order differential equations and the characteristic</span>\
  \ <span m='943000'>equation had a repeated root. And I had to go into a song and</span>\
  \ <span m='947000'>dance and stand on my head and multiply things by t and so on.</span>\
  \ <span m='951000'>And then talk very hard arguing why that was a good thing to\
  \ do</span> <span m='954000'>to get the answer. Now, I am not going to do the</span>\
  \ <span m='957000'>same thing here. Instead, I am going to try to</span> <span m='962000'>solve\
  \ the problem instead. Let's get two points by at</span> <span m='966000'>least\
  \ doing the easy part of it. Lambda equals zero.</span> <span m='971000'>What am\
  \ I supposed to do with</span> <span m='973000'>lambda equals zero? I am looking\
  \ for the alpha that</span> <span m='977000'>goes with that. And I find that eigenvector\
  \ by</span> <span m='981000'>solving this system of equations.</span> <span m='984000'>Let's\
  \ write out what that system of equations is.</span> <span m='989000'>Well, if lambda\
  \ is zero, this isn't there.</span> <span m='992000'>It is just the matrix A times\
  \ alpha equals zero.</span> <span m='998000'>And the matrix A is,</span> <span m='1000000'>I\
  \ never even wrote it anywhere. I never wrote A.</span> <span m='1005000'>I thought\
  \ I would get away without having to do it,</span> <span m='1009000'>but you never\
  \ get away with anything.</span> <span m='1013000'>It's the principle of life. That\
  \ is A.</span> <span m='1018000'>If I subtract zero from the main diagonal,</span>\
  \ <span m='1021000'>that doesn't do a great deal to A.</span> <span m='1024000'>And\
  \ the resulting system of equations is those same things,</span> <span m='1030000'>except\
  \ you have the a1's there, too.</span> <span m='1033000'>There is one. a1 minus\
  \ 2 a2 plus a3 equals</span> <span m='1037000'>zero. I am just subtracting zero\
  \ from</span> <span m='1042000'>the main diagonal so there is nothing to do.</span>\
  \ <span m='1046000'>a2 minus 2 a3 equals zero. Now I am supposed to solve</span>\
  \ <span m='1053000'>those.</span> <span m='1060000'>Of course we could do it. Well,\
  \ how do you know how to</span> <span m='1063000'>solve a system of three linear\
  \ equations?</span> <span m='1065000'>Well, elimination. You can always solve by</span>\
  \ <span m='1068000'>elimination. Now we are much more</span> <span m='1070000'>sophisticated\
  \ than that. You all have pocket calculators</span> <span m='1074000'>so you could\
  \ use the inverse matrix, right?</span> <span m='1076000'>No. You cannot use the\
  \ inverse</span> <span m='1078000'>matrix. What will happen if you punch</span>\
  \ <span m='1083000'>in those coefficients and then punch in A inverse.</span> <span\
  \ m='1088000'>What answer will it give you? 0, 0, 0.</span> <span m='1092000'>No,\
  \ I am sorry. It won't give you any answer.</span> <span m='1096000'>What will it\
  \ say? It will say I cannot calculate</span> <span m='1101000'>the inverse to that\
  \ matrix because the whole purpose of</span> <span m='1107000'>this exercise was\
  \ to find a value of lambda such that this</span> <span m='1113000'>system of equations\
  \ is dependent.</span> <span m='1118000'>The coefficient determinant is zero and,\
  \ therefore,</span> <span m='1122000'>the coefficient matrix does not have an inverse\
  \ matrix.</span> <span m='1126000'>You cannot use that method. In other words,</span>\
  \ <span m='1129000'>the inverse matrix will never work in these problems because</span>\
  \ <span m='1134000'>the system of equations you will be trying to solve is always\
  \ a</span> <span m='1139000'>non-independent system. And, therefore,</span> <span\
  \ m='1143000'>its determinant is always zero. And, therefore,</span> <span m='1146000'>there\
  \ is no inverse matrix because the determinant of the</span> <span m='1151000'>coefficient\
  \ is zero. All you can do is use</span> <span m='1154000'>elimination or physical\
  \ insight and common sense.</span> <span m='1158000'>Now, because I teach differential\
  \ equations everybody</span> <span m='1163000'>assumes, mistakenly, as I think,\
  \ that I really know</span> <span m='1167000'>something about them. I get now and\
  \ then graduate</span> <span m='1172000'>students, not in mathematics, but some\
  \ obscure field of</span> <span m='1176000'>engineering or whatever drift into my\
  \ office and say I see you</span> <span m='1180000'>teach differential equations.\
  \ Do you have a minute here?</span> <span m='1185000'>And before I can say no they\
  \ write their differential</span> <span m='1189000'>equation on the board. And almost\
  \ invariably it is</span> <span m='1192000'>nothing I have ever seen before. And\
  \ they so look at me</span> <span m='1197000'>hopefully and expectantly. So what\
  \ do I ask them?</span> <span m='1201000'>I don't ask them what they have tried.</span>\
  \ <span m='1205000'>What I ask them is where did this come from?</span> <span m='1208000'>What\
  \ field did it come from? Because each field has its own</span> <span m='1214000'>little\
  \ tricks. It gets the same differential</span> <span m='1217000'>equations all the\
  \ time and has its own little tricks for</span> <span m='1222000'>solving them.\
  \ You should do the same thing</span> <span m='1226000'>here. Well, of course we\
  \ can solve</span> <span m='1229000'>this. And by now most of you have</span> <span\
  \ m='1233000'>solved it just by inspection, just by sort of psyching out</span>\
  \ <span m='1237000'>the answer. But a better way is to say</span> <span m='1240000'>look,\
  \ suppose we had the solution, what would the</span> <span m='1244000'>solution\
  \ look like? Well, it would look like (a1,</span> <span m='1248000'>a2, a3), whatever\
  \ the values of those variables were which gave</span> <span m='1252000'>me the\
  \ solution to the equation, times e to the 0t.</span> <span m='1257000'>But what\
  \ is this? e to the 0t is one</span> <span m='1262000'>for all time. And, therefore,</span>\
  \ <span m='1264000'>this is a constant solution. What I am asking is to find a</span>\
  \ <span m='1269000'>constant solution. Now, can I, by inspection,</span> <span m='1273000'>find\
  \ a constant solution to this?</span> <span m='1275000'>If so it must be the one.\
  \ Well, there is an obvious</span> <span m='1279000'>constant solution. All the\
  \ cells have the same</span> <span m='1283000'>temperature. If that is true then\
  \ there is</span> <span m='1286000'>no reason why it should ever change as time\
  \ goes on.</span> <span m='1292000'>The physical problem itself suggests what the\
  \ answer must</span> <span m='1295000'>be. You don't have to solve</span> <span\
  \ m='1297000'>equations. In other words,</span> <span m='1298000'>any constant like\
  \ (1, 1, 1).</span> <span m='1300000'>Well, could it be (20, 20, 20)?</span> <span\
  \ m='1302000'>Yeah, that is a constant multiple of (1,</span> <span m='1304000'>1,\
  \ 1). That is included.</span> <span m='1305000'>My basic constant solution, therefore,\
  \ is simply (1,</span> <span m='1308000'>1, 1) times e to the 0t.</span> <span m='1311000'>You\
  \ don't have to include e to the 0t because it is one.</span> <span m='1314000'>Now,\
  \ just to check, is (1, 1, 1) a solution to</span> <span m='1317000'>these equations?\
  \ It certainly is.</span> <span m='1321000'>1 plus 1 minus 2 is zero in every case.</span>\
  \ <span m='1324000'>The equations are essentially the same, except they use</span>\
  \ <span m='1328000'>different variables. By inspection or,</span> <span m='1331000'>if\
  \ you like, by elimination,</span> <span m='1334000'>but not by finding the inverse\
  \ matrix you solve those</span> <span m='1338000'>equations. And we have our first\
  \ solution.</span> <span m='1341000'>Now let's go onto the second one.</span> <span\
  \ m='1344000'>For the second one, we are going to have to use the</span> <span m='1348000'>eigenvalue\
  \ lambda equals negative 3.</span> <span m='1353000'>And now what is the system\
  \ of equations?</span> <span m='1356000'>Well, now I have to take this and I have\
  \ to subtract negative</span> <span m='1361000'>3 from the diagonal elements. Minus\
  \ 2 minus negative 3 is</span> <span m='1366000'>plus 1, right?</span> <span m='1369000'>Got\
  \ that? Each of the diagonal elements,</span> <span m='1373000'>after I subtract\
  \ minus 3 turns into plus 1.</span> <span m='1378000'>And, therefore, the system\
  \ becomes,</span> <span m='1380000'>the system I have to solve is a1 plus a2 plus\
  \ a3 equals zero.</span> <span m='1385000'>And what is the second</span> <span m='1389000'>equation?\
  \ Symmetry is preserved.</span> <span m='1391000'>All the equations are essentially\
  \ the same,</span> <span m='1394000'>except for the names of the variables so they\
  \ all must give</span> <span m='1399000'>you the same thing after I subtract minus\
  \ 3 from the main</span> <span m='1404000'>diagonal. Well, that is what we call\
  \ a</span> <span m='1407000'>dependent system of equations. All I have is the same\
  \ equation</span> <span m='1414000'>repeated twice, but I still have to solve it.</span>\
  \ <span m='1418000'>Now, what you see is that there are lots of solutions to this.</span>\
  \ <span m='1424000'>Let me write down one of them. For example,</span> <span m='1429000'>suppose\
  \ I made a1 equal to 1 and I made a2 a 0,</span> <span m='1434000'>then a3 would\
  \ be negative 1.</span> <span m='1440000'>So here is a solution. That is the eigenvector.</span>\
  \ <span m='1443000'>And with it, I can make the solution by</span> <span m='1446000'>multiplying\
  \ by e to the negative 3t.</span> <span m='1450000'>There is a solution. But that\
  \ is not the only alpha</span> <span m='1454000'>I could have chosen. Suppose I\
  \ chose this one</span> <span m='1458000'>instead. Suppose I kept this 1,</span>\
  \ <span m='1460000'>but this time made a3 zero. Well, in that case,</span> <span\
  \ m='1464000'>there would be a2 that had to be minus 1.</span> <span m='1470000'>Now,\
  \ is this essentially different from that one?</span> <span m='1472000'>It would\
  \ still be multiplied by e to the minus 3t,</span> <span m='1476000'>but don't be\
  \ fooled by the e to the minus 3t.</span> <span m='1479000'>That is our scalar.\
  \ That is not what is essential.</span> <span m='1482000'>What is essential is the\
  \ content of these two vectors.</span> <span m='1485000'>Is either one a multiple\
  \ of the other?</span> <span m='1487000'>The answer is no. Therefore, they are</span>\
  \ <span m='1489000'>independent. They are pointing in two</span> <span m='1491000'>different\
  \ directions in three space, these two vectors.</span> <span m='1496000'>And, therefore,\
  \ I have two independent</span> <span m='1499000'>solutions just by picking two\
  \ different vectors that solve</span> <span m='1503000'>those three equations. This\
  \ is also a solution.</span> <span m='1507000'>If I call this the eigenvector alpha\
  \ 1, then I ought to call</span> <span m='1512000'>this one the alpha 2. Hey, we\
  \ can keep on going</span> <span m='1516000'>through this. Why not make the first\
  \ one</span> <span m='1519000'>zero? Well, what would happen if I</span> <span m='1521000'>made\
  \ the first one 0, and then 1, and minus 1?</span> <span m='1525000'>The answer\
  \ is this one is no longer independent of those two.</span> <span m='1532000'>I\
  \ can get it by taking a combination of those two.</span> <span m='1534000'>Do you\
  \ see what combination I should take?</span> <span m='1542000'>This one minus that\
  \ one. This guy minus that guy gives</span> <span m='1547000'>me that guy, isn't\
  \ that right? 1 minus 1, 0 minus minus 1,</span> <span m='1552000'>minus 1 minus\
  \ 0. This is not a new one.</span> <span m='1556000'>It looks new, but it is not.</span>\
  \ <span m='1560000'>I can get it by taking a linear combination of these two.</span>\
  \ <span m='1564000'>It is not independent delta. And that would be true for any</span>\
  \ <span m='1568000'>other possible solution you could get for these equations.</span>\
  \ <span m='1572000'>Once you found two solutions, all the others will be linear</span>\
  \ <span m='1576000'>combinations of them. Well, I cannot use that one.</span> <span\
  \ m='1580000'>It is not new. And the general solution,</span> <span m='1583000'>therefore,\
  \ will be a combination, c1 times that one</span> <span m='1586000'>plus a constant\
  \ times this one. Plus the first one that I found</span> <span m='1592000'>c3 times\
  \ (1, 1, 1) e to the 0t,</span> <span m='1596000'>which I don't have to write in.\
  \ That is the general solution to</span> <span m='1602000'>the system, (x1,x2, x3).</span>\
  \ <span m='1605000'>What happens as time goes to infinity?</span> <span m='1608000'>Regardless\
  \ of what the values of these two C's this term goes</span> <span m='1614000'>to\
  \ zero, that term goes to zero and what I am left with is a</span> <span m='1620000'>constant\
  \ solution. So all of these solutions tend</span> <span m='1626000'>to be the solution\
  \ where all the cells are at the same</span> <span m='1631000'>temperature. Well,\
  \ of course there must be</span> <span m='1635000'>some vocabulary word in this.\
  \ There is.</span> <span m='1639000'>There are two vocabulary words. This is a good\
  \ eigenvalue.</span> <span m='1645000'>There are also bad eigenvalues. This is a\
  \ good repeated</span> <span m='1652000'>eigenvalue, but good is not the official\
  \ word.</span> <span m='1657000'>An eigenvalue like this, which is repeated but\
  \ where you</span> <span m='1664000'>can find enough eigenvectors, if lambda is\
  \ a repeated</span> <span m='1670000'>eigenvalue, it occurs multiply in the characteristic\
  \ polynomial</span> <span m='1677000'>as a root. But you can find enough</span>\
  \ <span m='1683000'>independent eigenvectors -- Forget the \"but.\"</span> <span\
  \ m='1710000'>-- to make up the needed number of independent solutions.</span> <span\
  \ m='1716000'>For example, if it is repeated once,</span> <span m='1720000'>that\
  \ is it occurs doubly then somehow I have got to get two</span> <span m='1726000'>solutions\
  \ out of that as I was able to here.</span> <span m='1731000'>If it occurred triply,\
  \ I have got to get three</span> <span m='1736000'>solutions out of it. I would\
  \ look for three</span> <span m='1742000'>independent eigenvectors and hope I could\
  \ find them.</span> <span m='1746000'>That is the good case because it tells you\
  \ how to make up as</span> <span m='1752000'>many solutions as you need. And this\
  \ kind of eigenvalue is</span> <span m='1757000'>called in the literature the complete\
  \ eigenvalue.</span> <span m='1770000'>Now, how about the kind in which you cannot?</span>\
  \ <span m='1773000'>Well, unfortunately, all my life I have called it</span> <span\
  \ m='1777000'>incomplete, which seems to be a perfectly reasonable thing to</span>\
  \ <span m='1783000'>call it. However, terminology changes</span> <span m='1786000'>slowly\
  \ over time. The notes, because I wrote</span> <span m='1790000'>them, call it an\
  \ incomplete eigenvalue.</span> <span m='1793000'>But the accepted term nowadays\
  \ is defective.</span> <span m='1797000'>I don't like that. It violates the \"eigenvalues</span>\
  \ <span m='1802000'>with disabilities act\" or something.</span> <span m='1806000'>But\
  \ I have to give it to you because that is the word I am</span> <span m='1811000'>going\
  \ to try to use from now on, at least if I remember to use</span> <span m='1818000'>it.\
  \ It would be the word,</span> <span m='1820000'>for example, used in the linear\
  \ algebra</span> <span m='1824000'>course 18.06 \"plug, plug,\" defective otherwise.</span>\
  \ <span m='1830000'>A defective eigenvalue is one where you can get one</span> <span\
  \ m='1833000'>eigenvector. If it is double,</span> <span m='1834000'>for example,\
  \ if it a double eigenvalue.</span> <span m='1837000'>It is defective if you can\
  \ get one eigenvector that goes with</span> <span m='1841000'>it, but you cannot\
  \ find an independent one.</span> <span m='1843000'>The only other ones you can\
  \ find are multiples of the first</span> <span m='1847000'>one. Then you are really\
  \ in trouble</span> <span m='1849000'>because you just don't have enough solutions\
  \ that you are</span> <span m='1853000'>supposed to get out of that, and you have\
  \ to do something.</span> <span m='1858000'>What you do is turn to problem two on\
  \ your problem set and</span> <span m='1861000'>solve it because that tells you\
  \ what to do.</span> <span m='1864000'>And I even give you an example to work.</span>\
  \ <span m='1866000'>Problem two, that little matrix has a</span> <span m='1869000'>defective\
  \ eigenvalue. It doesn't look defective,</span> <span m='1872000'>but you cannot\
  \ tell. It is defective.</span> <span m='1874000'>But you, nonetheless, will be\
  \ able to find two</span> <span m='1877000'>solutions because you will be following\
  \ instructions.</span> <span m='1892000'>Now, the only other thing I should tell\
  \ you is one of the</span> <span m='1895000'>most important theorems in linear algebra,</span>\
  \ <span m='1897000'>which is totally beyond the scope of this course and is</span>\
  \ <span m='1901000'>beyond the scope of most elementary linear algebra</span> <span\
  \ m='1904000'>courses as I have taught around the country but,</span> <span m='1907000'>of\
  \ course, not at MIT. But, nonetheless,</span> <span m='1909000'>it is the last\
  \ theorem in the course.</span> <span m='1911000'>That means it is liable to use\
  \ stuff.</span> <span m='1913000'>The theorem goes by different names.</span> <span\
  \ m='1915000'>Sometimes it is called the principle axis theorem.</span> <span m='1920000'>Sometimes\
  \ it is called the spectral theorem.</span> <span m='1924000'>But, anyway, what\
  \ it says is,</span> <span m='1926000'>if A is a real end-by-end matrix which is\
  \ symmetric,</span> <span m='1931000'>you know what a symmetric matrix is?</span>\
  \ <span m='1935000'>The formal definition is it is equal to its transpose.</span>\
  \ <span m='1940000'>What that means is if you flip it around the main diagonal it</span>\
  \ <span m='1945000'>looks just the same as before. Somewhere on this board,</span>\
  \ <span m='1952000'>right there, in fact, is a symmetric matrix.</span> <span m='1956000'>What\
  \ happened to it? Right here was the symmetric</span> <span m='1960000'>matrix.\
  \ I erased the one thing which I</span> <span m='1964000'>had to have. Minus 2,\
  \ 1, 1;</span> <span m='1966000'>1, minus 2, 1; 1, 1 minus 2.</span> <span m='1971000'>That\
  \ was our matrix A. The matrix is symmetric because</span> <span m='1977000'>if\
  \ I flip it around the diagonal it looks the same as it did</span> <span m='1982000'>before.\
  \ Well, not exactly.</span> <span m='1986000'>The ones are sort of lying on their\
  \ side, but you have to take</span> <span m='1990000'>account of that. Is that right?</span>\
  \ <span m='1992000'>The twos are backward. Well, you know what I mean.</span> <span\
  \ m='1995000'>Put that element there, this one here,</span> <span m='1998000'>that\
  \ one there. Exchange these two.</span> <span m='2000000'>Notice the diagonal elements\
  \ don't all have to be minus 2 for</span> <span m='2004000'>that. No matter what\
  \ they were,</span> <span m='2006000'>they are the guys that aren't moved when you\
  \ do the flipping.</span> <span m='2012000'>Therefore, there is no condition on\
  \ them.</span> <span m='2014000'>It is these other guys. Each guy here has to use\
  \ the</span> <span m='2018000'>same guy there. This one has to be the same as</span>\
  \ <span m='2022000'>that one, and so on. Then it will be real and</span> <span m='2025000'>symmetric.\
  \ If you have a matrix that is</span> <span m='2028000'>real and symmetric, like\
  \ the one we have been</span> <span m='2031000'>working with, the theorem is that\
  \ all its</span> <span m='2034000'>eigenvalues are complete. That is a very unobvious</span>\
  \ <span m='2038000'>theorem. All its eigenvalues are</span> <span m='2042000'>automatically\
  \ complete. And it is a remarkable fact</span> <span m='2047000'>that you can prove\
  \ that purely generally with a certain amount</span> <span m='2054000'>of pure reasoning\
  \ no calculation at all.</span> <span m='2058000'>But it has to be true, and it\
  \ is true.</span> <span m='2062000'>You will find there are whole branches of applied\
  \ differential</span> <span m='2068000'>equations. You know, equilibrium theory,</span>\
  \ <span m='2073000'>all the matrices that you deal with are always symmetric.</span>\
  \ <span m='2077000'>And, therefore, this repeated eigenvalues is</span> <span m='2080000'>not\
  \ something you have to worry about, finding extra solutions.</span> <span m='2085000'>Well,\
  \ I guess that is the end of the first part of the</span> <span m='2089000'>lecture.\
  \ I have a third of it left.</span> <span m='2092000'>Let's talk fast. I would like\
  \ to,</span> <span m='2095000'>with the remaining time, explain to you what to do\
  \ if</span> <span m='2099000'>you were to get complex eigenvalues.</span> <span\
  \ m='2108000'>Now, actually, the answer is follow the same</span> <span m='2111000'>program.\
  \ In other words,</span> <span m='2112000'>if you solve the characteristic equation\
  \ and you get a complex</span> <span m='2117000'>root, follow the program, calculate\
  \ the corresponding</span> <span m='2120000'>complex eigenvectors. In other words,</span>\
  \ <span m='2123000'>solve the equations. Everything will be the same</span> <span\
  \ m='2126000'>except that the eigenvectors will turn out to be complex,</span> <span\
  \ m='2130000'>that is will have complex entries.</span> <span m='2134000'>Don't\
  \ worry about it. Then form the solutions.</span> <span m='2137000'>The solutions\
  \ are now going to look once again like alpha times</span> <span m='2143000'>e to\
  \ the a plus bi to the t.</span> <span m='2147000'>This will be complex and that\
  \ will be complex,</span> <span m='2151000'>too. This will have complex entries.</span>\
  \ <span m='2154000'>And then, finally, take the real and imaginary</span> <span\
  \ m='2158000'>parts. Those will be real and they</span> <span m='2162000'>will give\
  \ real and two solutions.</span> <span m='2164000'>In other words, the program is\
  \ exactly like</span> <span m='2168000'>what we did for second-order differential\
  \ equations.</span> <span m='2172000'>We used the complex numbers, got complex solutions.</span>\
  \ <span m='2176000'>And then, at the very last step, we took the real and</span>\
  \ <span m='2180000'>imaginary parts to get two real solutions out of each complex</span>\
  \ <span m='2185000'>number. I would like to give you a</span> <span m='2187000'>simple\
  \ example of working that out.</span> <span m='2190000'>And it is the system x prime\
  \ equals x plus 2y.</span> <span m='2195000'>And y prime equals minus x</span> <span\
  \ m='2199000'>minus y. Because it is springtime,</span> <span m='2205000'>it doesn't\
  \ feel like spring but it will this weekend as it is</span> <span m='2211000'>getting\
  \ warmer. And since, when I am too tired</span> <span m='2216000'>to make up problem\
  \ sets for you late at night,</span> <span m='2221000'>I watch reruns of Seinfeld.\
  \ I am from New York.</span> <span m='2226000'>It is just in my bloodstream. Of\
  \ course, the most interesting</span> <span m='2232000'>character on Seinfeld is\
  \ George. We are going to consider Susan</span> <span m='2239000'>who is the girlfriend\
  \ who got killed by licking poison</span> <span m='2244000'>envelopes. And George\
  \ carried on their</span> <span m='2248000'>love affair until Susan was disposed\
  \ of by the writers by</span> <span m='2253000'>this strange death. And we are going\
  \ to consider x</span> <span m='2259000'>is modeling Susan's love for George.</span>\
  \ <span m='2263000'>That is x. And George's love for Susan</span> <span m='2267000'>will\
  \ be y. Now, I don't mean the absolute</span> <span m='2271000'>love. If x and y\
  \ are zero,</span> <span m='2273000'>I don't mean that they don't love each other.</span>\
  \ <span m='2278000'>I just mean that that is the equilibrium value of the love.</span>\
  \ <span m='2285000'>Everything else is measured as departures from that.</span>\
  \ <span m='2290000'>So (0, 0) represents the normal amount of love,</span> <span\
  \ m='2295000'>if love is measured. I don't know what love units</span> <span m='2300000'>are.\
  \ Hearts, I guess.</span> <span m='2302000'>Six hearts, let's say. Now, in what\
  \ sense does this</span> <span m='2307000'>model it? This is a normal equation and</span>\
  \ <span m='2312000'>this is a neurotic equation. That is why this is George and</span>\
  \ <span m='2316000'>this is Susan who seemed very normal to me.</span> <span m='2319000'>Susan\
  \ is a normal person. When y is positive that means</span> <span m='2323000'>that\
  \ George seems to be loving her more today than yesterday,</span> <span m='2327000'>and\
  \ her natural response is to be more in love with him.</span> <span m='2331000'>That\
  \ is what most people are. If y is negative,</span> <span m='2334000'>hey, what's\
  \ the matter with George?</span> <span m='2337000'>He doesn't feel so good. Maybe\
  \ there is something wrong</span> <span m='2342000'>with him. She gets a little\
  \ mad at him</span> <span m='2346000'>and this goes down. x prime is negative.</span>\
  \ <span m='2350000'>And the same way why is this positive?</span> <span m='2353000'>Well,\
  \ again, it is a psychological thing,</span> <span m='2357000'>but all the world\
  \ loves a lover.</span> <span m='2360000'>When Susan is in love, as she feels x\
  \ is high,</span> <span m='2364000'>that makes her feel good. And she loves everything,</span>\
  \ <span m='2368000'>in fact. Not just George.</span> <span m='2372000'>It is one\
  \ of those things. You all know what I am talking</span> <span m='2378000'>about.\
  \ Now, George,</span> <span m='2380000'>of course, is what makes the writers happy.</span>\
  \ <span m='2384000'>George is neurotic and, therefore, is exactly the</span> <span\
  \ m='2389000'>opposite. He sees one day that he feels</span> <span m='2393000'>more\
  \ in love with Susan than he was yesterday.</span> <span m='2400000'>Does this make\
  \ him happy? Not at all.</span> <span m='2402000'>Not at all. It makes y prime more\
  \ negative.</span> <span m='2405000'>Why? Because all he can think of is,</span>\
  \ <span m='2408000'>my God, suppose I am really in love with this girl?</span> <span\
  \ m='2411000'>Suppose I marry her. Oh, my God, 40 years of seeing</span> <span m='2415000'>the\
  \ same person at breakfast all the time.</span> <span m='2418000'>I must be crazy.\
  \ And so it goes down.</span> <span m='2420000'>Here is our neurotic model. The\
  \ question for differential</span> <span m='2424000'>equations is, what do the solutions\
  \ to that</span> <span m='2427000'>look like? In other words,</span> <span m='2431000'>how\
  \ does, in fact, their love affair go?</span> <span m='2434000'>Now, there is a\
  \ reason why the writers picked that model,</span> <span m='2439000'>as you will\
  \ see. It means they were able to get</span> <span m='2444000'>a year's worth of\
  \ episodes out of it.</span> <span m='2447000'>And why is that so? Well, let's solve\
  \ it.</span> <span m='2450000'>The characteristic equation is lambda squared.</span>\
  \ <span m='2454000'>The matrix that governs this system is A equals (1,</span> <span\
  \ m='2459000'>2; negative 1, negative 1)</span> <span m='2462000'>The trace of that\
  \ matrix,</span> <span m='2466000'>the sum of the diagonal elements is zero.</span>\
  \ <span m='2470000'>There is the zero lambda here. The determinant,</span> <span\
  \ m='2473000'>which is the constant term, is negative 1,</span> <span m='2476000'>minus\
  \ negative 2, which is plus 1.</span> <span m='2479000'>So the characteristic equation,\
  \ by calculating the trace and</span> <span m='2483000'>determinant is lambda squared\
  \ plus 1 equals 0.</span> <span m='2488000'>The eigenvalues are plus and</span>\
  \ <span m='2492000'>minus i. Now, you don't have to pick</span> <span m='2495000'>both\
  \ of them because the negative one lead to essentially</span> <span m='2500000'>the\
  \ same solutions but with negative signs.</span> <span m='2504000'>Either one will\
  \ do just as we solved second order equations.</span> <span m='2509000'>The system\
  \ for finding the eigenvectors,</span> <span m='2513000'>well, we are going to have\
  \ to accept the complex eigenvector.</span> <span m='2520000'>What is the system\
  \ going to be? Well, I take the matrix and I</span> <span m='2525000'>subtract i.\
  \ We will use i.</span> <span m='2527000'>Subtract i from the main diagonal.</span>\
  \ <span m='2530000'>So the system is (1 minus i) times a1 plus 2a2 is zero.</span>\
  \ <span m='2535000'>And let's, for good measure,</span> <span m='2539000'>write\
  \ the other one down, too.</span> <span m='2542000'>It is negative a1 plus minus\
  \ (1 minus i) times a2.</span> <span m='2548000'>Then what is the solution?</span>\
  \ <span m='2553000'>Well, you get the solution the usual way.</span> <span m='2559000'>Let's\
  \ take a1 equal to 1.</span> <span m='2564000'>Then what is a2? a2 is 1 minus i\
  \ divided by 2</span> <span m='2570000'>from the first equation.</span> <span m='2578000'>So\
  \ the complex solution is 1 minus i over 2 times</span> <span m='2582000'>e to the\
  \ it. Now you have to take the real</span> <span m='2585000'>and imaginary parts\
  \ of that. This is the only part which</span> <span m='2589000'>technically I would\
  \ not trust you to do without having someone</span> <span m='2593000'>show you how\
  \ to do it. What do you do?</span> <span m='2595000'>Well, of course, you know how\
  \ to separate the</span> <span m='2598000'>real and imaginary parts of that.</span>\
  \ <span m='2600000'>It is the first thing is to separate the vectors.</span> <span\
  \ m='2605000'>I don't know how to explain this.</span> <span m='2609000'>Just watch.\
  \ The real part of it is 1,</span> <span m='2613000'>one-half. It should be negative\
  \ 1,</span> <span m='2617000'>so minus this plus that because I didn't put that\
  \ on the right</span> <span m='2625000'>side. It is minus one-half plus i</span>\
  \ <span m='2629000'>times (0, one-half).</span> <span m='2634000'>Anybody want to\
  \ fight?</span> <span m='2640000'>1 plus i times 0 minus one-half plus one-half\
  \ times i.</span> <span m='2646000'>You saw how I did that? Okay.</span> <span m='2650000'>When\
  \ you do these problem you do it the same way,</span> <span m='2656000'>but don't\
  \ ask me to explain what I just did.</span> <span m='2661000'>Here it is cosine\
  \ t plus i sine t.</span> <span m='2670000'>And so the real part will give me one\
  \ solution.</span> <span m='2674000'>The imaginary part will give me another.</span>\
  \ <span m='2679000'>Since I have a limited amount of time, let's just calculate</span>\
  \ <span m='2685000'>the real part. What is it?</span> <span m='2688000'>Well, it\
  \ is (1, minus \xBD) times cosine t,</span> <span m='2692000'>i squared is negative\
  \ 1, so minus (0,</span> <span m='2696000'>one-half), the negative 1 from the i\
  \ squared,</span> <span m='2701000'>times sine t.</span> <span m='2704000'>Now,\
  \ what solution is that?</span> <span m='2710000'>This is (x, y). Take the final\
  \ step.</span> <span m='2713000'>It doesn't have to look like that.</span> <span\
  \ m='2716000'>x equals cosine t.</span> <span m='2719000'>Do you see that? x equals\
  \ cosine t plus 0 times</span> <span m='2724000'>sine t.</span> <span m='2727000'>What\
  \ is y? y is minus one-half times</span> <span m='2731000'>cosine t, minus one-half\
  \ times sine t, plus sine t.</span> <span m='2737000'>Now, you may have the pleasure</span>\
  \ <span m='2742000'>of showing eliminating t. You get a quadratic polynomial</span>\
  \ <span m='2747000'>in x and y equals zero. This is an ellipse.</span> <span m='2751000'>As\
  \ t varies, you can see this repeats its</span> <span m='2755000'>values at intervals\
  \ of 2pi, this gives an ellipse.</span> <span m='2761000'>And if you want to use\
  \ a little computer program,</span> <span m='2765000'>linear phase, this is not\
  \ in the assignment,</span> <span m='2769000'>but the ellipses look like this and\
  \ go around that way.</span> <span m='2774000'>And that is the model of George and\
  \ Susan's love.</span> <span m='2779000'>x, Susan. y, George.</span> <span m='2781000'>They\
  \ go round and round in this little love circle,</span> <span m='2785000'>and it\
  \ stretches on for 26 episodes.</span> </p>"
