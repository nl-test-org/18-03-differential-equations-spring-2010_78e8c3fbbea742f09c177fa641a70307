title: 'Lecture 21: Convolution Formula'
transcript: "<p><span m='10000'> Today is going to be one of the more difficult lectures\
  \ of the</span> <span m='14000'>term. So, put on your thinking caps,</span> <span\
  \ m='17000'>as they would say in elementary school.</span> <span m='20000'>The topic\
  \ is going to be what's called a convolution.</span> <span m='25000'>The convolution\
  \ is something very peculiar that you do to two</span> <span m='29000'>functions\
  \ to get a third function.</span> <span m='32000'>It has its own special symbol.\
  \ f of t asterisk is the</span> <span m='38000'>universal symbol that's used for\
  \ that.</span> <span m='41000'>So, this is a new function of t, which bears very\
  \ little</span> <span m='45000'>resemblance to the ones, f of t, that you started\
  \ with.</span> <span m='50000'>I'm going to give you the formula for it,</span>\
  \ <span m='53000'>but first, there are two ways of motivating it,</span> <span m='57000'>and\
  \ both are important. There is a formal motivation,</span> <span m='62000'>which\
  \ is why it's tucked into the section on Laplace</span> <span m='67000'>transform.\
  \ And, the formal motivation is</span> <span m='70000'>the following. Suppose we\
  \ start with the</span> <span m='73000'>Laplace transform of those two functions.</span>\
  \ <span m='77000'>Now, the most natural question to ask is, since Laplace</span>\
  \ <span m='82000'>transforms are really a pain to calculate is from old Laplace</span>\
  \ <span m='87000'>transforms, is it easy to get new ones?</span> <span m='92000'>And,\
  \ the first thing, of course, summing functions is</span> <span m='95000'>easy.\
  \ That gives you the sum of the</span> <span m='97000'>transforms. But, a more natural\
  \ question</span> <span m='100000'>would be, suppose I want to multiply F of t and\
  \ G</span> <span m='103000'>of t. Is there, hopefully,</span> <span m='105000'>some\
  \ neat formula? If I multiply the product of</span> <span m='108000'>the, take the\
  \ product of these two, is there some neat formula</span> <span m='112000'>for the\
  \ Laplace transform of that product?</span> <span m='115000'>That would simply life\
  \ greatly. And, the answer is,</span> <span m='118000'>there is no such formula.\
  \ And there never will be.</span> <span m='123000'>Well, we will not give up entirely.</span>\
  \ <span m='125000'>Suppose we ask the other question.</span> <span m='128000'>Suppose\
  \ instead I multiply the Laplace transforms.</span> <span m='131000'>Could that\
  \ be related to something I cook up out of F of</span> <span m='135000'>t and G\
  \ of t? Could it be the transform of</span> <span m='140000'>something I cook up\
  \ out of F of t or G of t?</span> <span m='143000'>And, that's what the convolution\
  \ is for.</span> <span m='146000'>The answer is that F of s times G of s turns out</span>\
  \ <span m='151000'>to be the Laplace transform of the convolution.</span> <span\
  \ m='156000'>The convolution, and that's one way of defining</span> <span m='160000'>it,\
  \ is the function of t you should put it there in order</span> <span m='165000'>that\
  \ its Laplace transform turn out to be the product of F of s</span> <span m='170000'>times\
  \ G of s. Now, I'll give you,</span> <span m='174000'>in a moment, the formula for\
  \ it.</span> <span m='177000'>But, I'll give you one and a quarter minutes,</span>\
  \ <span m='181000'>well, two minutes of motivation as to why there should be such</span>\
  \ <span m='187000'>formula. Now, I won't calculate this out</span> <span m='190000'>to\
  \ the end because I don't have time.</span> <span m='193000'>But, here's the reason\
  \ why there should be such formula.</span> <span m='196000'>And, you might suspect,\
  \ and therefore it would be worth</span> <span m='199000'>looking for. It's because,</span>\
  \ <span m='201000'>remember, I told you where the Laplace transform came from,</span>\
  \ <span m='204000'>that the Laplace transform was the continuous analog of a power</span>\
  \ <span m='208000'>series. So, when you ask a general</span> <span m='211000'>question\
  \ like that, the place to look for is if you</span> <span m='214000'>know an analogous\
  \ idea, say, does it work.</span> <span m='217000'>something like that work there?\
  \ So, here I have a power series</span> <span m='221000'>summation, (a)n x to the\
  \ n.</span> <span m='223000'>Remember, you can write this in computer notation as\
  \ a of n</span> <span m='227000'>to make it look like f of n,</span> <span m='230000'>f\
  \ of t. And, the analog is turned into</span> <span m='233000'>t when you turn a\
  \ power series into the Laplace transform,</span> <span m='237000'>and x gets turned\
  \ into e to the negative s,</span> <span m='241000'>and one formula just turns into\
  \ the other.</span> <span m='245000'>Okay, so, there's a formula for F of x.</span>\
  \ <span m='248000'>This is the analog of the Laplace transform.</span> <span m='252000'>And,\
  \ similarly, G of x here is</span> <span m='255000'>summation (b)n x to the n.</span>\
  \ <span m='258000'>Now, again, the na\u012Bve question would be, well,</span> <span\
  \ m='261000'>suppose I multiply the two corresponding coefficients</span> <span\
  \ m='265000'>together, and add up that power series, summation (a)n (b)n</span>\
  \ <span m='270000'>times x to the n.</span> <span m='274000'>Is that somehow, that\
  \ sum related to F and G?</span> <span m='277000'>And, of course, everybody knows\
  \ the answer to</span> <span m='280000'>that is no. It has no relation whatever.</span>\
  \ <span m='284000'>But, suppose instead I multiply these two guys.</span> <span\
  \ m='287000'>In that case, I'll get a new power series.</span> <span m='290000'>I\
  \ don't know what its coefficients are,</span> <span m='293000'>but let's write\
  \ them down. Let's just call them (c)n's.</span> <span m='298000'>So, what I'm asking\
  \ is, this corresponds to the product</span> <span m='302000'>of the two Laplace\
  \ transforms. And, what I want to know is,</span> <span m='308000'>is there a formula\
  \ which says that (c)n is equal to something</span> <span m='314000'>that can be\
  \ calculated out of the (a)i and the (b)j.</span> <span m='319000'>Now, the answer\
  \ to that is, yes, there is.</span> <span m='324000'>And, the formula for (c)n is\
  \ called the convolution.</span> <span m='330000'>Now, you could figure out this\
  \ formula yourself.</span> <span m='333000'>You figure it out. Anyone who's smart\
  \ enough to be</span> <span m='336000'>interested in the question in the first place\
  \ is smart enough</span> <span m='341000'>to figure out what that formula is.</span>\
  \ <span m='343000'>And, it will give you great pleasure to see that it's just</span>\
  \ <span m='347000'>like the formula for the convolution of going to give you</span>\
  \ <span m='351000'>now. So, what is that formula for</span> <span m='354000'>the\
  \ convolution? Okay, hang on.</span> <span m='356000'>Now, you are not going to\
  \ like it.</span> <span m='360000'>But, you didn't like the formula for the Laplace</span>\
  \ <span m='363000'>transform, either. You felt wiser,</span> <span m='366000'>grown-up\
  \ getting it. But it's a mouthful to swallow.</span> <span m='370000'>It's something\
  \ you get used to slowly.</span> <span m='373000'>And, you will get used to the\
  \ convolution equally slowly.</span> <span m='377000'>So, what is the convolution\
  \ of f of t and g of t?</span> <span m='382000'>It's a function calculated</span>\
  \ <span m='385000'>according to the corresponding formula.</span> <span m='388000'>It's\
  \ a function of t. It is the integral from zero to</span> <span m='392000'>t of\
  \ f of u, -- u is a dummy variable because</span> <span m='397000'>it's going to\
  \ be integrated out when I do the integration,</span> <span m='403000'>g of (t minus\
  \ u) dt.</span> <span m='409000'>That's it.</span> <span m='410000'>I didn't make\
  \ it up. I'm just varying the bad news.</span> <span m='415000'>Well, what do you\
  \ do when you see a formula?</span> <span m='420000'>Well, the first thing to do,\
  \ of course, is try calculating</span> <span m='425000'>just to get some feeling\
  \ for what kind of a thing,</span> <span m='430000'>you know. Let's try some examples.</span>\
  \ <span m='434000'>Let's see, let's calculate, what would be a modest</span> <span\
  \ m='438000'>beginning? Let's calculate the convolution</span> <span m='441000'>of\
  \ t with itself. Or, better yet,</span> <span m='444000'>let's calculate the convolution\
  \ just so that you could tell the</span> <span m='448000'>difference, t with t squared,\
  \ t squared with t,</span> <span m='452000'>to make it a little easier. By the way,\
  \ the convolution is</span> <span m='457000'>symmetric. f star g is the same thing\
  \ as g</span> <span m='460000'>star f. Let's put that down explicitly.</span> <span\
  \ m='463000'>I forgot to last period. So, tell all the guys who came</span> <span\
  \ m='467000'>to the one o'clock lecture that you know something that they</span>\
  \ <span m='471000'>don't. Now, that's a theory.</span> <span m='473000'>It's commutative.\
  \ This operation is commutative,</span> <span m='477000'>in other words. Now, that\
  \ has to be a theorem</span> <span m='480000'>because the formula is not symmetric.</span>\
  \ <span m='484000'>The formula does not treat f and g equally.</span> <span m='487000'>And\
  \ therefore, this is not obvious.</span> <span m='491000'>It's at least not obvious\
  \ if you look at it that way,</span> <span m='495000'>but it is obvious if you look\
  \ at it that way.</span> <span m='499000'>Why? In other words,</span> <span m='501000'>f\
  \ star g is the guy whose Laplace transform is F of</span> <span m='507000'>s times\
  \ G of s. Well, what would g star f?</span> <span m='513000'>That would be the guy\
  \ whose</span> <span m='515000'>Laplace transform is G times F.</span> <span m='517000'>But\
  \ capital F times capital G is the same as capital G times</span> <span m='521000'>capital\
  \ F. So, it's because the Laplace</span> <span m='525000'>transforms are commutative.\
  \ Ordinary multiplication is</span> <span m='528000'>commutative. It follows that\
  \ this has to be</span> <span m='531000'>commutative, too. So, I'll write that down,</span>\
  \ <span m='534000'>since F times G is equal to GF. And, you have to understand</span>\
  \ <span m='538000'>that here, I mean that these are the Laplace transforms of those</span>\
  \ <span m='542000'>guys. But, it's not obvious from the</span> <span m='546000'>formula.\
  \ Okay, let's calculate the</span> <span m='548000'>Laplace transform of, sorry,\
  \ the convolution of t</span> <span m='551000'>star, let's do it by the formula.</span>\
  \ <span m='554000'>All right, by the formula, I calculate integral zero to t.</span>\
  \ <span m='558000'>Now, I take the first function, but I change its variable to</span>\
  \ <span m='563000'>the dummy variable, u.</span> <span m='564000'>So, that's u squared.\
  \ I take the second function and</span> <span m='568000'>replace its variable by\
  \ u minus t.</span> <span m='573000'>So, this is times t minus u, sorry.</span>\
  \ <span m='578000'>Okay, do you see that to calculate this is what I have to</span>\
  \ <span m='585000'>write down? That's what the formula</span> <span m='589000'>becomes.\
  \ Anything wrong?</span> <span m='591000'>Oh, sorry, the du, the integration's with\
  \ expect</span> <span m='597000'>to u, of course. Thanks very much.</span> <span\
  \ m='603000'>Okay, let's do it. So, it is, integral of u</span> <span m='606000'>squared\
  \ t is, remember, it's integrated with</span> <span m='610000'>respect to u. So,\
  \ it's u cubed over three</span> <span m='613000'>times t. The rest of it is the\
  \ integral</span> <span m='617000'>of u cubed, which is u to the forth over</span>\
  \ <span m='621000'>four. All this is to be evaluated</span> <span m='624000'>between\
  \ zero and t at the upper limit.</span> <span m='627000'>So, I put u equal t, I\
  \ get t to the forth over three</span> <span m='632000'>minus t to the forth over\
  \ four.</span> <span m='638000'>Of course, at the lower limit, u is zero.</span>\
  \ <span m='641000'>So, both of these are terms of zero.</span> <span m='643000'>There's\
  \ nothing there. And, the answer is,</span> <span m='646000'>therefore, t to the\
  \ forth divided by,</span> <span m='649000'>a third minus a quarter is a twelfth.</span>\
  \ <span m='653000'>So, that's doing it from the formula.</span> <span m='656000'>But,\
  \ of course, there is an easier way to do</span> <span m='659000'>it. We can cheat\
  \ and use the</span> <span m='661000'>Laplace transform instead. If I Laplace transform\
  \ it,</span> <span m='666000'>the Laplace transform of t squared is what?</span>\
  \ <span m='670000'>It's two factorial divided by s cubed.</span> <span m='673000'>The\
  \ Laplace transform of t</span> <span m='676000'>is one divided by s squared.</span>\
  \ <span m='680000'>And so, because this is the convolution of these,</span> <span\
  \ m='684000'>it should correspond to the product of the Laplace</span> <span m='688000'>transforms,\
  \ which is two over s to the 5th power.</span> <span m='694000'>Well, is that the\
  \ same as this? What's the Laplace transform</span> <span m='698000'>of, in other\
  \ words, what's the inverse Laplace</span> <span m='702000'>transform of two over\
  \ s to the fifth?</span> <span m='707000'>Well, the inverse Laplace transform of\
  \ four factorial over</span> <span m='711000'>s to the fifth is how much?</span>\
  \ <span m='715000'>That's t to the forth, right?</span> <span m='718000'>Now, how\
  \ does this differ? Well, to turn that into that,</span> <span m='723000'>I should\
  \ divide by four times three.</span> <span m='726000'>So, this should be one twelfth\
  \ t to the forth,</span> <span m='730000'>one over four times three because this\
  \ is 24,</span> <span m='733000'>and that's two, so, divide by 12 to determine</span>\
  \ <span m='735000'>what constant, yeah.</span> <span m='737000'>So, it works, at\
  \ least in that case.</span> <span m='739000'>But now, notice that this is not an\
  \ ordinary product.</span> <span m='742000'>The convolution of t squared and t is\
  \ not something</span> <span m='746000'>like t cubed. It's something like t to the</span>\
  \ <span m='750000'>forth, and there's a funny constant in there,</span> <span m='753000'>too,\
  \ very unpredictable. Let's look at the convolution.</span> <span m='758000'>Let's\
  \ take another example of the convolution.</span> <span m='761000'>Let's do something\
  \ really humble just assure you that</span> <span m='765000'>this, even at the simplest\
  \ example, this is not trivial.</span> <span m='770000'>Let's take the convolution\
  \ of f of t with one.</span> <span m='774000'>Can you take, yeah, one is a function\
  \ just</span> <span m='777000'>like any function. But, you get something out of</span>\
  \ <span m='781000'>the convolution, yes, yes.</span> <span m='783000'>Let's just\
  \ write down the formula.</span> <span m='785000'>Now, I can't use the Laplace transform\
  \ here because you won't</span> <span m='789000'>know what to do with it. You don't\
  \ have that formula</span> <span m='793000'>yet. It's a secret one that only I</span>\
  \ <span m='795000'>know. So, let's do it.</span> <span m='796000'>Let's calculate\
  \ it out the way it was supposed to.</span> <span m='799000'>So, it's the integral\
  \ from zero to t of f of u,</span> <span m='803000'>and now, what do I do with that\
  \ one?</span> <span m='805000'>I'm supposed to take, one is the function g of t,</span>\
  \ <span m='809000'>and wherever I see a t, I'm supposed to plug in t</span> <span\
  \ m='812000'>minus u. Well, I don't see any t there.</span> <span m='819000'>But\
  \ that's something for rejoicing.</span> <span m='823000'>There's nothing to do\
  \ to make the substitution.</span> <span m='828000'>It's just one. So, the answer\
  \ is,</span> <span m='832000'>it's this curious thing. The convolution of a function</span>\
  \ <span m='838000'>with one, you integrate it from zero to t.</span> <span m='844000'>Well,\
  \ as they said in Alice in Wonderland, things are getting</span> <span m='848000'>curiouser\
  \ and curiouser. I mean, what is going on with</span> <span m='852000'>this crazy\
  \ function, and where are we supposed to</span> <span m='856000'>start with it?\
  \ Well, I'm going to prove this</span> <span m='859000'>for you, mostly because\
  \ the proof is easy.</span> <span m='863000'>In other words, I'm going to prove\
  \ that that's</span> <span m='866000'>true. And, as I give the proof,</span> <span\
  \ m='869000'>you'll see where the convolution is coming from.</span> <span m='872000'>That's\
  \ number one. And, number two,</span> <span m='874000'>the real reason I'm giving\
  \ you the proof: because it's a</span> <span m='878000'>marvelous exercise in changing\
  \ the variables in a double</span> <span m='882000'>integral. Now, that's something\
  \ you all</span> <span m='884000'>know how to do, even the ones who are taking</span>\
  \ <span m='887000'>18.02 concurrently, and I didn't advise you to do</span> <span\
  \ m='890000'>that. But, I've arranged the course</span> <span m='892000'>so it's\
  \ possible to do. But, I knew that by the time we</span> <span m='896000'>got to\
  \ this, you would already know how to change variables at</span> <span m='900000'>a\
  \ double integral. So, and in fact,</span> <span m='904000'>you will have the advantage\
  \ of remembering how to do it because</span> <span m='910000'>you just had it about\
  \ a week or two ago, whereas all the other</span> <span m='915000'>guys, it's something\
  \ dim in their distance.</span> <span m='919000'>So, I'm reviewing how to change\
  \ variables at a double integral.</span> <span m='925000'>I'm showing you it's good\
  \ for something.</span> <span m='929000'>So, what we are out to try to prove is\
  \ this formula.</span> <span m='933000'>Let's put that down in, so you understand.</span>\
  \ <span m='939000'>Okay, let's do it. Now, we'll use the desert</span> <span m='941000'>island\
  \ method. So, you have as much time as</span> <span m='944000'>you want. You're\
  \ on a desert island.</span> <span m='946000'>In fact, I'm going to even go it the\
  \ opposite way.</span> <span m='949000'>I'm going to start with-- you've got a lot\
  \ of time on your</span> <span m='953000'>hands and say, gee, I wonder if I take\
  \ the</span> <span m='956000'>product of the Laplace transforms, I wonder if there's</span>\
  \ <span m='959000'>some crazy function I could put in there, which would make</span>\
  \ <span m='963000'>things work. You've never heard of the</span> <span m='966000'>convolution.\
  \ You're going to discover it all</span> <span m='969000'>by yourself. Okay, so\
  \ how do you begin?</span> <span m='971000'>So, we'll start with the left hand side.</span>\
  \ <span m='974000'>We're looking for some nice way of calculating that as the</span>\
  \ <span m='977000'>Laplace transform of a single function.</span> <span m='979000'>So,\
  \ the way to begin is by writing out the definitions.</span> <span m='983000'>We\
  \ couldn't use anything else since we don't have anything</span> <span m='986000'>else\
  \ to use. Now, looking ahead,</span> <span m='988000'>I'm going to not use t. I'm\
  \ going to use two neutral</span> <span m='992000'>variables when I calculate. After\
  \ all, the t is just a</span> <span m='995000'>dummy variable anyway. You will see\
  \ in a minute the</span> <span m='1000000'>wisdom of doing this. So, it's this times\
  \ the</span> <span m='1004000'>integral, which gives the Laplace transform of g.</span>\
  \ <span m='1008000'>So, that's e to the negative s v, let's say,</span> <span m='1012000'>times\
  \ g of v, dv.</span> <span m='1013000'>Okay, everybody can get that far.</span>\
  \ <span m='1016000'>But now we have to start looking.</span> <span m='1020000'>Well,\
  \ this is a single integral, an 18.01 integral</span> <span m='1023000'>involving\
  \ u, and this is an 18.01 integral involving v.</span> <span m='1027000'>But when\
  \ you take the product of two integrals like that,</span> <span m='1031000'>remember\
  \ when you evaluate a double integral,</span> <span m='1034000'>there's an easy\
  \ case where it's much easier than any other case.</span> <span m='1039000'>If you\
  \ could write the inside, if you are integrating over a</span> <span m='1043000'>rectangle,\
  \ for example, and you can write the integral</span> <span m='1047000'>as a product\
  \ of a function just of u, and a product of a</span> <span m='1051000'>function\
  \ just as v, then the integral is very easy</span> <span m='1054000'>to evaluate.\
  \ You can forget all the rules.</span> <span m='1058000'>You just take all the u\
  \ part out, all the v part out,</span> <span m='1062000'>and integrate them separately,\
  \ a to b, c to d.</span> <span m='1064000'>That's the easy case of evaluating a\
  \ double integral.</span> <span m='1068000'>It's what everybody tries to do, even\
  \ when it's not</span> <span m='1071000'>appropriate. Now, here it is appropriate,</span>\
  \ <span m='1073000'>except I'm going to use it backwards.</span> <span m='1076000'>This\
  \ is the result of having done that.</span> <span m='1078000'>If this is the result\
  \ of having done it, what was the step just</span> <span m='1082000'>before it?\
  \ Well, I must have been trying</span> <span m='1086000'>to evaluate a double integral\
  \ as u runs from zero to infinity and</span> <span m='1090000'>v runs from zero\
  \ to infinity, of what?</span> <span m='1093000'>Well, of the product of these two\
  \ functions.</span> <span m='1096000'>Now, what is that? e to the minus s u times\
  \ e to</span> <span m='1100000'>the minus s v.</span> <span m='1102000'>Well, I\
  \ must surely want to combine those.</span> <span m='1105000'>e to the minus s u\
  \ times e to the minus s v.</span> <span m='1110000'>And, what's left? Well, what\
  \ gets dragged along?</span> <span m='1113000'>du dv. This is the same as that</span>\
  \ <span m='1115000'>because of that law I just gave you this is the product of a</span>\
  \ <span m='1119000'>function just of u, and a function just of v.</span> <span m='1122000'>And\
  \ therefore, it's okay to separate the two</span> <span m='1125000'>integrals out\
  \ that way because I'm integrating sort of a</span> <span m='1129000'>rectangle\
  \ that goes to infinity that way and infinity that way.</span> <span m='1134000'>But,\
  \ what I'm integrating is over the plane,</span> <span m='1137000'>in other words,\
  \ this region of the plane as u,</span> <span m='1140000'>v goes from zero to infinity,\
  \ zero to infinity.</span> <span m='1145000'>Now, let's take a look. What are we\
  \ looking for?</span> <span m='1150000'>Well, we're looking for, we would be very\
  \ happy if u</span> <span m='1155000'>plus v were t. Let's make it t.</span> <span\
  \ m='1160000'>In other words, I'm introducing a new variable,</span> <span m='1165000'>t,\
  \ u plus v, and it's suggested by the form</span> <span m='1170000'>in which I'm\
  \ looking for the answer.</span> <span m='1175000'>Now, of course you then have\
  \ to, we need another variable.</span> <span m='1179000'>We could keep either u\
  \ or v. Let's keep u.</span> <span m='1183000'>That means v, we just gave a musical\
  \ chairs.</span> <span m='1186000'>v got dropped out. Well, we can't have three</span>\
  \ <span m='1190000'>variables. We only have room for two.</span> <span m='1193000'>But,\
  \ we will remember it. Rest in peace,</span> <span m='1197000'>v was equal to t\
  \ minus u in case we ever need him</span> <span m='1202000'>again. Okay, let's now\
  \ put in the</span> <span m='1205000'>limits. Let's put in the integral,</span>\
  \ <span m='1208000'>the rest of the change of variable.</span> <span m='1210000'>So,\
  \ I'm now changing it to these new variables,</span> <span m='1214000'>t and u,\
  \ so it's e to the negative s t.</span> <span m='1218000'>Well, f of u I don't have\
  \ to do anything to.</span> <span m='1222000'>But, g of v, I'm not allowed to keep\
  \ v,</span> <span m='1225000'>so v has to be changed to t minus u.</span> <span\
  \ m='1230000'>Amazing things are happening. Now, I want to change this to</span>\
  \ <span m='1234000'>an integral du dt. Now, for that,</span> <span m='1237000'>you\
  \ have to be a little careful.</span> <span m='1240000'>We have two things to do\
  \ to figure out this;</span> <span m='1243000'>what goes with that? And, we have\
  \ to put in the</span> <span m='1247000'>limits, also. Now, those are the two</span>\
  \ <span m='1250000'>nontrivial operations, when you change variables in a</span>\
  \ <span m='1255000'>double integral. So, let's be really careful.</span> <span m='1260000'>Let's\
  \ do the easier of the two, first.</span> <span m='1263000'>I want to change from\
  \ du dv to du dt.</span> <span m='1267000'>And now, to do that, you have to put\
  \ in the Jacobian</span> <span m='1272000'>matrix, the Jacobian determinant.</span>\
  \ <span m='1275000'>Ah-ha! How many of you forgot that?</span> <span m='1279000'>I\
  \ won't even bother asking. Oh, come on,</span> <span m='1283000'>you only lose\
  \ two points. It doesn't matter if you put it</span> <span m='1288000'>in the Jacobian.\
  \ As you see, you're going to</span> <span m='1294000'>forget something. You will\
  \ lose less credit for</span> <span m='1299000'>forgetting than anything else. So,\
  \ it's the Jacobian of u and</span> <span m='1305000'>v with respect to u and t.\
  \ So, to calculate that,</span> <span m='1309000'>you write u equals u, v equals\
  \ t minus u,</span> <span m='1314000'>and then the Jacobian is the partial of the\
  \ matrix,</span> <span m='1320000'>the determinant of partial derivatives.</span>\
  \ <span m='1325000'>So, it's the determinant whose entries are the partial of u</span>\
  \ <span m='1329000'>with respect to u, the partial of u with respect</span> <span\
  \ m='1333000'>to t, but these are independent variables.</span> <span m='1336000'>So,\
  \ that's zero. The partial of v with respect</span> <span m='1340000'>to u is negative\
  \ one. The partial of v with respect</span> <span m='1344000'>to t is one. So, the\
  \ Jacobian is one.</span> <span m='1347000'>So, if you forgot it, no harm.</span>\
  \ <span m='1351000'>So, the Jacobian is one. Now, more serious,</span> <span m='1354000'>and\
  \ in some ways, I think, for most of you,</span> <span m='1357000'>the most difficult\
  \ part of the operation, is putting in the new</span> <span m='1361000'>limits.\
  \ Now, for that,</span> <span m='1363000'>you look at the region over which you're\
  \ integrating.</span> <span m='1366000'>I think I'd better do that carefully.</span>\
  \ <span m='1369000'>I need a bigger picture. That's really what I'm trying</span>\
  \ <span m='1373000'>to say. So, here's the (u,</span> <span m='1374000'>v) coordinates.\
  \ And, I want to change these to</span> <span m='1378000'>(u, t) coordinates. The\
  \ integration is over the</span> <span m='1381000'>first quadrant. So, what you\
  \ do is,</span> <span m='1385000'>when you do the integral, the first step is u\
  \ is varying,</span> <span m='1390000'>and t is held fixed. So, in the first integration,</span>\
  \ <span m='1395000'>u varies. t is held fixed.</span> <span m='1397000'>Now, what\
  \ is holding t fixed in this picture mean?</span> <span m='1402000'>Well, t is equal\
  \ to u plus v.</span> <span m='1406000'>So, u plus v is fixed, is a constant,</span>\
  \ <span m='1409000'>in other words. Now, where are the curves along</span> <span\
  \ m='1414000'>which u plus v is a constant?</span> <span m='1418000'>Well, they\
  \ are these lines. These are the lines along which</span> <span m='1423000'>u plus\
  \ v equals a constant, or t is a constant.</span> <span m='1427000'>The reason I'm\
  \ holding t a constant is because the first</span> <span m='1432000'>integration\
  \ only allows u to change.</span> <span m='1435000'>t is held fixed. Okay, you let\
  \ u increase.</span> <span m='1439000'>As u increases, and t is held fixed,</span>\
  \ <span m='1442000'>I'm traversing these lines in this direction.</span> <span m='1448000'>That's\
  \ the direction on which u is increasing.</span> <span m='1451000'>I integrate from\
  \ the point, from the u value where they</span> <span m='1455000'>leave the region.\
  \ And, to enter the region,</span> <span m='1458000'>what's the u value where they\
  \ enter the region?</span> <span m='1461000'>u is equal to zero. Everybody would\
  \ know that.</span> <span m='1464000'>Not so many people would be able to figure\
  \ out what to put</span> <span m='1468000'>for where it leaves the region. What's\
  \ the value of u when it</span> <span m='1474000'>leaves the region? Well, this\
  \ is the curve,</span> <span m='1478000'>v equals zero. But, v equals zero is,</span>\
  \ <span m='1482000'>in another language, u equals t.</span> <span m='1486000'>t\
  \ minus u equals zero, or u equals t.</span> <span m='1491000'>In other words, they\
  \ enter the region where u</span> <span m='1495000'>equals zero, and they leave\
  \ where u is t,</span> <span m='1500000'>has the value of t. And, how about the\
  \ other guys?</span> <span m='1505000'>For which t's do I want to do this?</span>\
  \ <span m='1507000'>Well, I want to do it for all these t values.</span> <span m='1510000'>Well,\
  \ now, the t value here, that's the starting one.</span> <span m='1514000'>Here,\
  \ t is zero, and here t is not zero.</span> <span m='1516000'>And, if I go out and\
  \ cover the whole first quadrant,</span> <span m='1520000'>I'll be letting t increase\
  \ to infinity.</span> <span m='1523000'>The sum of u and v, I will be letting increase\
  \ to</span> <span m='1526000'>infinity. So, it's zero to infinity.</span> <span\
  \ m='1530000'>So, all this is an exercise in taking this double integral in</span>\
  \ <span m='1535000'>(u, v) coordinates, and changing it to this double</span> <span\
  \ m='1540000'>integral, an equivalent double integral over the same region,</span>\
  \ <span m='1546000'>but now in (u, t) coordinates.</span> <span m='1548000'>And\
  \ now, that's the answer. Somewhere here is the answer</span> <span m='1554000'>because,\
  \ look, since the first integration is</span> <span m='1558000'>with respect to\
  \ u, this guy can migrate outside</span> <span m='1562000'>because it doesn't involve\
  \ u. That only involves t,</span> <span m='1568000'>and t is only caught by the\
  \ second integration.</span> <span m='1571000'>So, I can put this outside. And,\
  \ what do I end up with?</span> <span m='1575000'>The integral from zero to infinity\
  \ of e to the negative s</span> <span m='1578000'>t times,</span> <span m='1582000'>what's\
  \ left? A funny expression,</span> <span m='1584000'>but you're on your desert island\
  \ and found it.</span> <span m='1587000'>This funny expression, integral from zero\
  \ to t,</span> <span m='1590000'>f of u, g of t minus u vu,</span> <span m='1594000'>in\
  \ short, the convolution,</span> <span m='1597000'>exactly the convolution. So,\
  \ all you have to do is get</span> <span m='1602000'>the idea that there might be\
  \ a formula, sit down,</span> <span m='1605000'>change variables and double integral\
  \ it, ego,</span> <span m='1608000'>you've got your formula. Well, I would like\
  \ to spend</span> <span m='1612000'>much of the rest of the period--- in other words,</span>\
  \ <span m='1616000'>that's how it relates to the Laplace transform.</span> <span\
  \ m='1619000'>That's how it comes out of the Laplace transform.</span> <span m='1624000'>Here's\
  \ how to use it, calculate it either with the</span> <span m='1627000'>Laplace transform\
  \ or directly from the integral.</span> <span m='1630000'>And, of course, you will\
  \ solve problems,</span> <span m='1633000'>Laplace transform problems, differential\
  \ equations using</span> <span m='1637000'>the convolution. But, I have to tell\
  \ you that</span> <span m='1640000'>most people, convolution is very important.</span>\
  \ <span m='1643000'>And, most people who use it don't use it in connection with</span>\
  \ <span m='1647000'>the Laplace transform. They use it for its own sake.</span>\
  \ <span m='1650000'>The first place I learned that outside of MIT people used a</span>\
  \ <span m='1654000'>convolution was actually from my daughter.</span> <span m='1659000'>She's\
  \ an environmental engineer, an environmental</span> <span m='1661000'>consultant.\
  \ She does risk assessment,</span> <span m='1664000'>and stuff like that. But anyway,\
  \ she had this paper</span> <span m='1667000'>on acid rain she was trying to read\
  \ for a client,</span> <span m='1670000'>and she said something about calculating\
  \ acid rain falls on</span> <span m='1673000'>soil. And then, from there,</span>\
  \ <span m='1675000'>the stuff leeches into a river. But, things happen to it on\
  \ the</span> <span m='1678000'>way. Soil combines in various ways,</span> <span\
  \ m='1681000'>reduces the acidity, and things happen.</span> <span m='1683000'>Chemical\
  \ reactions take place, blah, blah, blah,</span> <span m='1686000'>blah. Anyways,\
  \ she said,</span> <span m='1688000'>well, then they calculated in the end how much\
  \ the river gets</span> <span m='1691000'>polluted. But, she said it's convolution.</span>\
  \ <span m='1693000'>She said, what's the convolution?</span> <span m='1695000'>So,\
  \ I told her she was too young to learn about the</span> <span m='1698000'>convolution.\
  \ And she knows that I thought</span> <span m='1700000'>I'd better look it up first.\
  \ I mean, I, of course,</span> <span m='1703000'>knew the convolution was, but I\
  \ was a little puzzled at</span> <span m='1706000'>that application of it. So, I\
  \ read the paper.</span> <span m='1709000'>It was interesting. And, in thinking\
  \ about it,</span> <span m='1713000'>other people have come to me, some guy with\
  \ a problem about,</span> <span m='1718000'>they drilled ice cores in the North\
  \ Pole, and from the</span> <span m='1721000'>radioactive carbon and so on, deducing\
  \ various things about</span> <span m='1726000'>the climate 60 billion years ago,\
  \ and it was all convolution.</span> <span m='1730000'>He asked me if I could explain\
  \ that to him.</span> <span m='1733000'>So, let me give you sort of all-purpose\
  \ thing,</span> <span m='1736000'>a simple all-purpose model, which can be adapted,</span>\
  \ <span m='1739000'>which is very good way of thinking of the convolution,</span>\
  \ <span m='1743000'>in my opinion. It's a problem of radioactive</span> <span m='1748000'>dumping.\
  \ It's in the notes,</span> <span m='1751000'>by the way. So, I'm just,</span> <span\
  \ m='1753000'>if you want to take a chance, and just listen to what I'm</span> <span\
  \ m='1758000'>saying rather that just scribbling everything down,</span> <span m='1763000'>maybe\
  \ you'll be able to figure it out for the notes,</span> <span m='1768000'>also.\
  \ So, the problem is we have some</span> <span m='1773000'>factory, or a nuclear\
  \ plant, or some thing like that,</span> <span m='1778000'>is producing radioactive\
  \ waste, not always at the same rate.</span> <span m='1784000'>And then, it carts\
  \ it, dumps it on a pile somewhere.</span> <span m='1789000'>So, radioactive waste\
  \ is dumped, and there's a dumping</span> <span m='1794000'>function. I'll call\
  \ that f of t,</span> <span m='1798000'>the dump rate. That's the dumping rate.</span>\
  \ <span m='1803000'>Let's say t is in years. You like to have units,</span> <span\
  \ m='1807000'>and quantity, kilograms, I don't know,</span> <span m='1810000'>whatever\
  \ you want. Now, what does the dumping rate</span> <span m='1815000'>mean? The dumping\
  \ rate means that if</span> <span m='1818000'>I have two times that are close together,\
  \ for example,</span> <span m='1823000'>two successive days, midnight on two successive</span>\
  \ <span m='1827000'>days, then there's a time interval between them.</span> <span\
  \ m='1833000'>I'll call that delta t. To say the dumping rate is f of</span> <span\
  \ m='1838000'>t means that the amount dumped in this time interval,</span> <span\
  \ m='1843000'>in the time interval from t1 to t1 plus one is</span> <span m='1849000'>approximately,\
  \ not exactly,</span> <span m='1852000'>because the dumping rate isn't even constant\
  \ within this time</span> <span m='1858000'>interval. But it's approximately the</span>\
  \ <span m='1862000'>dumping rate times the time over which the dumping is taking</span>\
  \ <span m='1869000'>place. That's what I mean by the dump</span> <span m='1873000'>rate.\
  \ And, it gets more and more</span> <span m='1876000'>accurate, the smaller the\
  \ time interval you take.</span> <span m='1881000'>Okay, now here's my problem.\
  \ The problem is,</span> <span m='1886000'>you start dumping at time t equals zero.</span>\
  \ <span m='1893000'>At time t equal t, how much radioactive waste is</span> <span\
  \ m='1899000'>in the pile?</span> <span m='1915000'>Now, what makes that problem\
  \ slightly complicated is</span> <span m='1918000'>radioactive waste decays. If\
  \ I put some at a certain day,</span> <span m='1922000'>and then go back several\
  \ months later and nothing's happened in</span> <span m='1927000'>between, I don't\
  \ have the same amount that I dumps because a</span> <span m='1931000'>fraction\
  \ of it decayed. I have less.</span> <span m='1934000'>And, our answer to the problem\
  \ must take account of,</span> <span m='1938000'>for each piece of waste, how long\
  \ it has been in the</span> <span m='1942000'>pile because that takes account of\
  \ how long it had to decay,</span> <span m='1947000'>and what it ends up as. So,\
  \ the calculation,</span> <span m='1952000'>the essential part of the calculation\
  \ will be that if you</span> <span m='1957000'>have an initial amount of this substance,\
  \ and it decays for a</span> <span m='1963000'>time, t, this is the amount left\
  \ at time t.</span> <span m='1967000'>This is the law of radioactive decay.</span>\
  \ <span m='1971000'>You knew that coming into 18.03, although,</span> <span m='1975000'>it's,\
  \ of course, a simple differential equation</span> <span m='1980000'>which produces\
  \ it, but I'll assume you simply know</span> <span m='1985000'>the answer. k depends\
  \ on the material,</span> <span m='1990000'>so I'm going to assume that the nuclear\
  \ plant dumps the same</span> <span m='1994000'>radioactive substance each time.\
  \ It's only one substance I'm</span> <span m='1999000'>calculating, and k is it.\
  \ So, assume the k is fixed.</span> <span m='2003000'>I don't have to change from\
  \ one k from one material to a k for</span> <span m='2007000'>another because it's\
  \ mixing up the stuff, just one material.</span> <span m='2013000'>Okay, and now\
  \ let's calculate it.</span> <span m='2015000'>Here's the idea. I'll take the t-axis,</span>\
  \ <span m='2018000'>but now I'm going to change its name to the u-axis.</span> <span\
  \ m='2023000'>You will see why in just a second.</span> <span m='2025000'>It starts\
  \ at zero. I'm interested in what's</span> <span m='2029000'>happening at the time,\
  \ t.</span> <span m='2031000'>How much is left at time t? So, I'm going to divide\
  \ up the</span> <span m='2036000'>interval from zero to t on this time axis into,</span>\
  \ <span m='2040000'>well, here's u0, the starting point,</span> <span m='2043000'>u1,\
  \ u2, let's make this u1. Oh, curses!</span> <span m='2048000'>u1, u2, u3, and so\
  \ on. Let's call this (u)n.</span> <span m='2053000'>So they're u(n + 1), not that\
  \ it matters.</span> <span m='2058000'>It doesn't matter. Okay, now, the amount,</span>\
  \ <span m='2063000'>so, what I'm going to do is look at the amount,</span> <span\
  \ m='2068000'>take the time interval from ui to ui plus one.</span> <span m='2076000'>This\
  \ is a time interval,</span> <span m='2080000'>delta u. Divide it up into equal\
  \ time</span> <span m='2083000'>intervals. So, the amount dumped in the</span> <span\
  \ m='2086000'>time interval from u(i) to u(i plus one)</span> <span m='2091000'>is\
  \ equal to approximately f of u(i),</span> <span m='2095000'>the dumping function\
  \ there, times delta u.</span> <span m='2100000'>We calculated that before. That's\
  \ what the meaning of the</span> <span m='2106000'>dumping rate is. By time t, how\
  \ much has it</span> <span m='2111000'>decayed to? It has decayed.</span> <span\
  \ m='2114000'>How much is left, in other words?</span> <span m='2118000'>Well, this\
  \ is the starting amount.</span> <span m='2121000'>So, the answer is going to be\
  \ it's f of (u)i times delta u</span> <span m='2128000'>times this factor, which\
  \ tells how much it decays,</span> <span m='2134000'>so, time. So, this is the starting\
  \ amount</span> <span m='2139000'>at time (u)i. That's when it was first</span>\
  \ <span m='2141000'>dumped, and this is the amount that was dumped,</span> <span\
  \ m='2145000'>times, multiply that by e to the minus k times,</span> <span m='2149000'>now,\
  \ what should I put up in there?</span> <span m='2151000'>I have to put the length\
  \ of time that it had to decay.</span> <span m='2155000'>What is the length of time\
  \ that it had to decay?</span> <span m='2160000'>It was dumped at u(i). I'm looking\
  \ at time,</span> <span m='2168000'>t, it decayed for time length t minus u i,</span>\
  \ <span m='2179000'>the length of time it had all the pile.</span> <span m='2192000'>So,\
  \ the stuff that was dumped in this time interval,</span> <span m='2196000'>at time\
  \ t when I come to look at it, this is how much of it is</span> <span m='2201000'>left.\
  \ And now, all I have to do is</span> <span m='2204000'>add up that quantity for\
  \ this time, the stuff that was dumped</span> <span m='2209000'>in this time interval\
  \ plus the stuff dumped in,</span> <span m='2214000'>and so on, all the way up to\
  \ the stuff that was dumped</span> <span m='2218000'>yesterday. And, the answer\
  \ will be the</span> <span m='2221000'>total amount left at time, t, that is not\
  \ yet decayed will</span> <span m='2226000'>be approximately, you add up the amount\
  \ coming</span> <span m='2230000'>from the first time interval plus the amount coming,</span>\
  \ <span m='2235000'>and so on. So, it will be f of u(i),</span> <span m='2239000'>I'll\
  \ save the delta u for the end, times e to the minus k</span> <span m='2243000'>times\
  \ t minus u(i) times delta u.</span> <span m='2247000'>So, these two parts represent</span>\
  \ <span m='2249000'>the amount dumped, and this is the decay factor.</span> <span\
  \ m='2253000'>And, I had those up as I runs from, well, where did I start?</span>\
  \ <span m='2257000'>From one to n, let's say.</span> <span m='2259000'>And now,\
  \ let delta t go to zero, in other words,</span> <span m='2262000'>make this delta\
  \ u go to zero, make this more accurate by</span> <span m='2266000'>taking finer\
  \ and finer subdivisions.</span> <span m='2268000'>In other words, instead of looking\
  \ every month</span> <span m='2271000'>to see how much was dumped, let's look every\
  \ week,</span> <span m='2275000'>every day, and so on, to make this calculation\
  \ more</span> <span m='2278000'>accurate. And, the answer is,</span> <span m='2280000'>this\
  \ approach is the exact amount, which will be the</span> <span m='2284000'>integral.\
  \ This sum is a Riemann sum.</span> <span m='2288000'>It approaches the integral\
  \ from zero to, well,</span> <span m='2292000'>I'm adding it up from u1 equals zero\
  \ to un equals t,</span> <span m='2298000'>the final value. So, it will be the integral</span>\
  \ <span m='2302000'>from the starting point to the ending point of f of u e to the</span>\
  \ <span m='2308000'>minus k times t minus u to u.</span> <span m='2314000'>That's\
  \ the answer to the problem.</span> <span m='2316000'>It's given by this rather\
  \ funny looking integral.</span> <span m='2319000'>But, from this point of view,\
  \ it's entirely natural.</span> <span m='2322000'>It's a combination of the dumping\
  \ function.</span> <span m='2324000'>This doesn't care what the material was.</span>\
  \ <span m='2327000'>It only wants to know how much was put on everyday.</span> <span\
  \ m='2330000'>And, this part, which doesn't care how much was</span> <span m='2333000'>put\
  \ on each day, it just is an intrinsic</span> <span m='2335000'>constant of the\
  \ material involving its decay rate.</span> <span m='2340000'>And, this total thing\
  \ represents the total amount.</span> <span m='2344000'>And that is, what is it?</span>\
  \ <span m='2346000'>It's the convolution of f of t with what function?</span> <span\
  \ m='2351000'>e to the minus k t. It's the convolution of the</span> <span m='2356000'>dumping\
  \ function and the decay function.</span> <span m='2359000'>And, the convolution\
  \ is exactly the operation that you have to</span> <span m='2365000'>have to do\
  \ that. Okay, so, I think this is the</span> <span m='2368000'>most intuitive physical\
  \ approach to the meaning of the</span> <span m='2373000'>convolution. In this particular,</span>\
  \ <span m='2377000'>you can say, well, that's very special.</span> <span m='2379000'>Okay,\
  \ so it tells you what the meaning of the convolution with</span> <span m='2383000'>an\
  \ exponential is. But, what about the convolution</span> <span m='2386000'>with\
  \ all the other functions we're going to have to use in</span> <span m='2390000'>this\
  \ course. They can all be interpreted</span> <span m='2392000'>just by being a little\
  \ flexible in your approach.</span> <span m='2395000'>I'll give you two examples\
  \ of this, well, three.</span> <span m='2398000'>First of all, I'll use it for,</span>\
  \ <span m='2400000'>in the problem set I ask you about a bank account.</span> <span\
  \ m='2405000'>That's not something any of you are interested in.</span> <span m='2408000'>Okay,\
  \ so, suppose instead I dumped garbage --</span> <span m='2416000'>-- undecaying.\
  \ So, something that doesn't</span> <span m='2419000'>decay at all, what's the answer\
  \ going to be?</span> <span m='2422000'>Well, the calculation will be exactly the\
  \ same.</span> <span m='2426000'>It will be the convolution of the dumping function.</span>\
  \ <span m='2430000'>The only difference is that now the garbage isn't going to</span>\
  \ <span m='2434000'>decay. So, no matter how long it's</span> <span m='2437000'>left,\
  \ the same amount is going to be left at the end.</span> <span m='2440000'>In other\
  \ words, I don't want to exponential</span> <span m='2442000'>decay function. I\
  \ want to function,</span> <span m='2444000'>one, the constant function, one, because\
  \ once I stick it on</span> <span m='2448000'>the pile, nothing happens to it. It\
  \ just stays there.</span> <span m='2451000'>So, it's going to be the convolution\
  \ of this one because</span> <span m='2454000'>this is constant. It's undecaying\
  \ --</span> <span m='2464000'>-- by the identical reasoning. And so, what's the\
  \ answer going</span> <span m='2467000'>to be? It's going to be the integral</span>\
  \ <span m='2469000'>from zero to t of f of u du.</span> <span m='2472000'>Now, that's\
  \ an 18.01 problem.</span> <span m='2474000'>If I dump with a dumping rate, f of\
  \ u,</span> <span m='2477000'>and I dump from time zero to time t, how much is on\
  \ the pile?</span> <span m='2480000'>They don't give it. They always give velocity</span>\
  \ <span m='2483000'>problems, and problems of how to slice up bread loaves,</span>\
  \ <span m='2486000'>and stuff like that. But, this is a real life</span> <span m='2488000'>problem.\
  \ If that's the dumping rate,</span> <span m='2492000'>and you dump for t days from\
  \ zero to time t,</span> <span m='2495000'>how much do you have left at the end?</span>\
  \ <span m='2497000'>Answer: the integral of f of u du from zero to t.</span> <span\
  \ m='2502000'>I'll give you another example.</span> <span m='2506000'>Suppose I\
  \ wanted a dumping function, suppose I wanted a</span> <span m='2510000'>function,\
  \ wanted to interpret something which grows like t,</span> <span m='2514000'>for\
  \ instance. All I want is a physical</span> <span m='2517000'>interpretation. Well,\
  \ I have to think,</span> <span m='2521000'>I'm making a pile of something, a metaphorical\
  \ pile,</span> <span m='2524000'>we don't actually have to make a physical pile.</span>\
  \ <span m='2527000'>And, the thing should be growing like t.</span> <span m='2529000'>Well,\
  \ what grows like t? Not bacteria,</span> <span m='2531000'>they grow exponentially.\
  \ Before the lecture,</span> <span m='2534000'>I was trying to think of something.</span>\
  \ <span m='2536000'>So, I came up with chickens on a chicken farm.</span> <span\
  \ m='2539000'>Little baby chickens grow linearly.</span> <span m='2541000'>All little\
  \ animals, anyway, I've observed that</span> <span m='2543000'>babies grow linearly,\
  \ at least for a while,</span> <span m='2546000'>thank God. After a while,</span>\
  \ <span m='2547000'>they taper off. But, at the beginning,</span> <span m='2552000'>they\
  \ eat every four hours or whatever.</span> <span m='2555000'>And they eat the same\
  \ amount, pretty much.</span> <span m='2559000'>And, that adds up. So, let's suppose\
  \ this</span> <span m='2563000'>represents the linear growth of chickens, of baby\
  \ chicks.</span> <span m='2568000'>That makes them sound cuter, less offensive.</span>\
  \ <span m='2572000'>Okay, so, a farmer, chicken farmer,</span> <span m='2576000'>whatever\
  \ they call them, is starting a new brood.</span> <span m='2582000'>So anyway, the\
  \ hens lay at a certain rate,</span> <span m='2585000'>and each of those are incubated.</span>\
  \ <span m='2588000'>And after a while, little baby chicks come out.</span> <span\
  \ m='2592000'>So, this will be the production rate for new chickens.</span> <span\
  \ m='2603000'>Okay, and it will be the convolution which will tell you</span> <span\
  \ m='2606000'>at time, t, the number of kilograms.</span> <span m='2609000'>We'd\
  \ better do this in kilograms, I'm afraid.</span> <span m='2612000'>Now, that's\
  \ not as heartless as it seems.</span> <span m='2615000'>The number of kilograms\
  \ of chickens times t.</span> <span m='2618000'>[LAUGHTER] It really isn't heartless\
  \ because,</span> <span m='2621000'>after all, why would the farmer want to know\
  \ that?</span> <span m='2624000'>Well, because a certain number of pounds of chicken\
  \ eat a</span> <span m='2628000'>certain number of pounds of chicken feed,</span>\
  \ <span m='2631000'>and that's how much he has to dump, must have to give them</span>\
  \ <span m='2635000'>every day. That's how he calculates his</span> <span m='2637000'>expenses.\
  \ So, he will have to know the</span> <span m='2641000'>convolution is, or better\
  \ yet,</span> <span m='2643000'>he will hire you, who knows what the convolution</span>\
  \ <span m='2647000'>is. And you'll be able to tell him.</span> <span m='2649000'>Okay,\
  \ why don't we stop there and go to recitation tomorrow.</span> <span m='2653000'>I'll\
  \ be doing important things.</span> </p>"
