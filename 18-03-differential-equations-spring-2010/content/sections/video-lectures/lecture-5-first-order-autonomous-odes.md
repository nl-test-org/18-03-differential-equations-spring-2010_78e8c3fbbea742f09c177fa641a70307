transcript: '<p><span m=''0''>Today, once again, a day of solving no</span> <span
  m=''3000''>differential equations whatsoever.</span> </p><p><span m=''5000''>The
  topic is a special kind of differential equation,</span> <span m=''10000''>which
  occurs a lot. It''s one in which the</span> <span m=''13000''>right-hand side doesn''t
  have any independent variable in it.</span> </p><p><span m=''18000''>Now, since
  I''m going to use as the independent variable,</span> <span m=''23000''>t for time,
  maybe it would be better to write the left-hand</span> <span m=''28000''>side to
  let you know, since you won''t be able to</span> <span m=''32000''>figure out any
  other way what it is, dy dt.</span> </p><p><span m=''37000''>We will write it this
  time. dy dt is equal to,</span> <span m=''42000''>and the point is that there is
  no t on the right hand side.</span> </p><p><span m=''50000''>So, there''s no t.
  There''s a name for such an</span> <span m=''56000''>equation. Now, some people
  call it time</span> <span m=''61000''>independent. The only problem with that is</span>
  <span m=''67000''>that sometimes the independent variable is a time.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''72000''>It''s something else. We need a generic word for</span> <span m=''77000''>there
  being no independent variable on the right-hand side.</span> </p><p><span m=''84000''>So,
  the word that''s used for that is autonomous.</span> </p><p><span m=''89000''>So,
  that means no independent variable on the right-hand side.</span> </p><p><span m=''97000''>It''s
  a function of y alone, the dependent variable.</span> </p><p><span m=''101000''>Now,
  your first reaction should be, oh, well,</span> <span m=''105000''>big deal. Big
  deal.</span> </p><p><span m=''107000''>If there''s no t on the right hand side,
  then we can solve</span> <span m=''113000''>this by separating variables. So, why
  has he been talking</span> <span m=''118000''>about it in the first place? So, I
  admit that.</span> </p><p><span m=''123000''>We can separate variables, and what
  I''m going to talk</span> <span m=''127000''>about today is how to get useful information
  out of the equation</span> <span m=''132000''>about how its solutions look without
  solving the equation.</span> </p><p><span m=''137000''>The reason for wanting to
  do that is, A, it''s fast.</span> </p><p><span m=''141000''>It gives you a lot of
  insight, and the actual solution,</span> <span m=''145000''>I''ll illustrate one,
  in the first place,</span> <span m=''149000''>take you quite a while. You may not
  be able to actually</span> <span m=''155000''>do the integrations, the required
  and separation of</span> <span m=''160000''>variables to get an explicit solution,
  or it might simply not</span> <span m=''167000''>be worth the effort of doing if
  you only want certain kinds of</span> <span m=''173000''>separations about the solution.
  So, the thing is,</span> <span m=''178000''>the problem is, therefore, to get qualitative</span>
  <span m=''183000''>information about the solutions without actually solving --</span>
  <span m=''191000''>Without actually having to solve the equation.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''194000''>Now, to do that, let''s take a quick look at how</span> <span m=''198000''>the
  direction fields of such an equation, after all,</span> <span m=''202000''>it''s
  the direction field is our principal tool for getting</span> <span m=''207000''>qualitative
  information about solutions without actually</span> <span m=''212000''>solving.
  So, how does the direction</span> <span m=''215000''>field look? Well, think about
  it for just a</span> <span m=''219000''>second, and you will see that every horizontal
  line is an</span> <span m=''224000''>isocline. So, the horizontal lines,</span>
  <span m=''227000''>what are their equations? This is the t axis.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''231000''>And, here''s the y axis. The horizontal lines have the</span> <span
  m=''236000''>formula y equals a constant. Let''s make it y equals a y zero</span>
  <span m=''241000''>for different values of the constant y zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''246000''>Those are the horizontal lines. And, the point is they are</span> <span
  m=''251000''>isoclines. Why?</span> </p><p><span m=''252000''>Well, because along
  any one of these horizontal lines,</span> <span m=''257000''>I''ll draw one in,
  what are the slopes of the line</span> <span m=''262000''>elements? The slopes are
  dy / dt is equal</span> <span m=''265000''>to f of y zero, but that''s a constant
  because</span> <span m=''270000''>there''s no t to change as you move in the horizontal</span>
  <span m=''275000''>direction. The slope is a constant.</span> </p><p><span m=''279000''>So,
  if I draw in that isocline, I guess I''ve forgotten,</span> <span m=''284000''>as
  our convention, isoclines are in dashed lines,</span> <span m=''287000''>but if
  you have color, you are allowed to put them in</span> <span m=''291000''>living
  yellow. Well, I guess I could make them</span> <span m=''295000''>solid, in that
  case. I don''t have to make a dash.</span> </p><p><span m=''300000''>Then, all the
  line elements, you put them in at will because</span> <span m=''304000''>they will
  all have, they are all the same,</span> <span m=''308000''>and they have slope,
  that, f of y0.</span> </p><p><span m=''311000''>And, similarly down here, they''ll
  have some other slope.</span> </p><p><span m=''316000''>This one will have some
  other slope.</span> </p><p><span m=''318000''>Whatever, this is the y zero, the
  value of it,</span> <span m=''323000''>and whatever that happens to be.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''325000''>I''ll put it one more. That''s the x-axis.</span> </p><p><span m=''330000''>I
  can use the x-axis. That''s an isocline,</span> <span m=''333000''>too. Now, what
  do you deduce about</span> <span m=''336000''>how the solutions must look? Well,
  let''s draw one solution.</span> </p><p><span m=''341000''>Suppose one solution
  looks like this.</span> </p><p><span m=''344000''>Well, that''s an integral curve,
  in other words.</span> </p><p><span m=''348000''>Its graph is a solution. Now, as
  I slide along,</span> <span m=''352000''>these slope elements stay exactly the same,</span>
  <span m=''356000''>I can slide this curb along horizontally,</span> <span m=''360000''>and
  it will still be an integral curve everywhere.</span> </p><p><span m=''366000''>So,
  in other words, they integral curves are</span> <span m=''369000''>invariant under
  translation for an equation of this type.</span> </p><p><span m=''374000''>They
  all look exactly the same, and you get them all by taking</span> <span m=''380000''>one,
  and just pushing it along. Well, that''s so simple it''s</span> <span m=''385000''>almost
  uninteresting, except in that these equations</span> <span m=''390000''>occur a
  lot in practice. They are often hard to</span> <span m=''394000''>integrate directly.
  And, therefore,</span> <span m=''398000''>it''s important to be able to get information
  about them.</span> </p><p><span m=''402000''>Now, how does one do that? There''s
  one critical idea,</span> <span m=''405000''>and that is the notion of a critical
  point.</span> </p><p><span m=''408000''>These equations have what are called critical
  points.</span> </p><p><span m=''412000''>And, what it is is very simple. There are
  three ways of looking</span> <span m=''417000''>at it: critical point, y zero;</span>
  <span m=''419000''>what does it mean for y0 to be a critical point?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''424000''>It means, another way of saying it is that it should be a zero</span>
  <span m=''428000''>of the right-hand side. So, if I ask you to find the</span> <span
  m=''431000''>critical points for the equation, what you will do is</span> <span
  m=''435000''>solve the equation f of y equals zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''438000''>Now,
  what''s interesting about them?</span> </p><p><span m=''441000''>Well, for a critical
  point, what would be the slope of the</span> <span m=''445000''>line element along,
  if this is at a critical level,</span> <span m=''448000''>if that''s a critical
  point? Look at that isocline.</span> </p><p><span m=''453000''>What''s the slope
  of the line elements along it?</span> </p><p><span m=''457000''>It is zero. And
  therefore,</span> <span m=''459000''>for these guys, these are, in other words,</span>
  <span m=''463000''>our solution curves. But let''s prove it formally.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''468000''>So, there are three ways of saying it.</span> </p><p><span m=''472000''>y
  zero is a critical point.</span> </p><p><span m=''475000''>It''s a zero of the right-hand
  side, or, y equals y0 is a</span> <span m=''480000''>solution to the equation. Now,
  that''s perfectly easy to</span> <span m=''485000''>verify. If y zero makes this</span>
  <span m=''490000''>right-hand side zero, it''s certainly also y equals y0</span>
  <span m=''494000''>makes the left-hand side zero because you''re</span> <span m=''498000''>differentiating
  a constant. So, the reasoning,</span> <span m=''501000''>if you want reasoning,
  is proof.</span> </p><p><span m=''504000''>Maybe we can make one line out of a proof.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''508000''>To say that it''s a solution, what does it mean to say
  that</span> <span m=''513000''>it''s a solution? It means to say that when you</span>
  <span m=''518000''>plug it in, plug in this constant function,</span> <span m=''522000''>y0,
  the dy0 dt is equal to f of y0.</span> </p><p><span m=''527000''>Is that true? Yeah.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''529000''>Both sides are zero. It''s true.</span> </p><p><span m=''532000''>Now,
  y0 is not a number. Well, it is.</span> </p><p><span m=''536000''>It''s a number
  on this side, but on this side,</span> <span m=''540000''>what I mean is a constant
  function whose constant value is</span> <span m=''546000''>y zero, this function,</span>
  <span m=''549000''>and its derivatives are zero because it has slope zero</span>
  <span m=''554000''>everywhere. So, this guy is a constant</span> <span m=''560000''>function,
  has slope zero. This is a number which makes</span> <span m=''565000''>the right-hand
  side zero. Well, that''s nice.</span> </p><p><span m=''570000''>So, in other words,
  what we found are,</span> <span m=''573000''>by finding these critical points, solving
  that equation,</span> <span m=''578000''>we found all the horizontal solutions.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''581000''>But, what''s so good about those?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''584000''>Surely, they must be the most interesting solutions there are.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''590000''>Well, think of how the picture goes.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''593000''>Let''s draw in one of those horizontal solutions.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''597000''>So, here''s a horizontal solution.</span> </p><p><span m=''602000''>That''s
  a solution. So, this is my y0.</span> </p><p><span m=''605000''>That''s the height
  at which it is.</span> </p><p><span m=''608000''>And, I''m assuming that f of y0
  equals zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''613000''>So, that''s a solution. Now, the significance
  of that</span> <span m=''618000''>is, because it''s a solution, in other words,</span>
  <span m=''622000''>it''s an integral curve, remember what''s true about</span> <span
  m=''627000''>integral curves. Other curves are not allowed to</span> <span m=''631000''>cross
  them. And therefore,</span> <span m=''635000''>these things are the absolute barriers.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''638000''>So, for example, suppose I have two of them is</span>
  <span m=''642000''>y0, and let''s say here''s another one, another constant solution.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''647000''>I want to know what the curves in between those can do.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''652000''>Well, I do know that whatever those red curves do,</span>
  <span m=''656000''>the other integral curves, they cannot cross this,</span> <span
  m=''660000''>and they cannot cross that. And, you must be able to</span> <span m=''666000''>translate
  them along each other without ever having two of them</span> <span m=''672000''>intersect.
  Now, that really limits their</span> <span m=''676000''>behavior, but I''m going
  to nail it down even more.</span> </p><p><span m=''681000''>So, other curves can''t
  cross these.</span> </p><p><span m=''684000''>Other integral curves can''t cross
  these yellow curves,</span> <span m=''689000''>these yellow lines, these horizontal
  lines.</span> </p><p><span m=''695000''>But, I''m going to show you more, and namely,</span>
  <span m=''699000''>so what I''m after is deciding, without solving the equation,</span>
  <span m=''705000''>what those curves must look like in between.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''709000''>Now, the way to do that is you draw, so if we want to make</span> <span
  m=''715000''>steps, everybody likes steps, okay, so step one is going to</span>
  <span m=''720000''>be, find these. Find the critical points.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''726000''>And, you''re going to do that by solving this equation,</span> <span
  m=''731000''>finding out where it''s zero. Once you have done that,</span> <span
  m=''736000''>you are going to draw the graph of f of y.</span> </p><p><span m=''741000''>And,
  the interest is going to be, where is it positive?</span> </p><p><span m=''747000''>Where
  is it negative? You''ve already found where it''s</span> <span m=''752000''>zero.
  Everywhere else,</span> <span m=''755000''>therefore, it must be either positive
  or negative.</span> </p><p><span m=''759000''>Now, once you have found that out,
  why am I interested in</span> <span m=''763000''>that? Well, because dy / dt is
  equal</span> <span m=''766000''>to f of y, right?</span> </p><p><span m=''769000''>That''s
  what the differential equation says.</span> </p><p><span m=''772000''>Therefore,
  if this, for example,</span> <span m=''775000''>is positive, that means this must
  be</span> <span m=''777000''>positive. It means that y must be</span> <span m=''780000''>increasing.
  It means the solution must be</span> <span m=''783000''>increasing. Where it''s
  negative,</span> <span m=''787000''>the solution will be decreasing.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''789000''>And, that tells me how it''s behaving in between these yellow</span>
  <span m=''793000''>lines, or on top of them, or on the bottom.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''795000''>Now, at this point, I''m going to stop,</span> <span m=''798000''>or
  not stop, I mean, I''m going to stop</span> <span m=''800000''>talking generally.
  And everything in the rest of</span> <span m=''803000''>the period will be done
  by examples which will get</span> <span m=''806000''>increasingly complicated, not
  terribly complicated by the</span> <span m=''810000''>end. But, let''s do one that''s
  super</span> <span m=''814000''>simple to begin with. Sorry, I shouldn''t say that</span>
  <span m=''818000''>because some of you may be baffled even by here because</span>
  <span m=''822000''>after all I''m going to be doing the analysis not in the usual</span>
  <span m=''827000''>way, but by using new ideas. That''s the way you make</span>
  <span m=''832000''>progress. All right, so,</span> <span m=''833000''>let''s do
  our bank account. So, y is money in the bank</span> <span m=''838000''>account.
  r is the interest rate.</span> </p><p><span m=''842000''>Let''s assume it''s a continuous
  interest rate.</span> </p><p><span m=''846000''>All banks nowadays pay interest
  continuously,</span> <span m=''851000''>the continuous interest rate. So, if that''s
  all there is,</span> <span m=''856000''>and money is growing, you know the differential</span>
  <span m=''861000''>equation says that the rate at which it grows is equal to r,</span>
  <span m=''866000''>the interest rate times a principle, the amount that''s in</span>
  <span m=''872000''>the bank at that time. So, that''s the differential</span> <span
  m=''878000''>equation that governs that. Now, that''s,</span> <span m=''881000''>of
  course, the solution is simply an exponential curve.</span> </p><p><span m=''886000''>There''s
  nothing more to say about it.</span> </p><p><span m=''889000''>Now, let''s make
  it more interesting.</span> </p><p><span m=''892000''>Let''s suppose there is a
  shifty teller at the bank,</span> <span m=''896000''>and your money is being embezzled
  from your account at a</span> <span m=''901000''>constant rate. So, let''s let w
  equal,</span> <span m=''906000''>or maybe e, but e has so many other uses in mathematics,</span>
  <span m=''911000''>w is relatively unused, w is the rate of embezzlement,</span>
  <span m=''916000''>thought of as continuous. So, every day a little bit of</span>
  <span m=''921000''>money is sneaked out of your account because you are not</span>
  <span m=''926000''>paying any attention to it. You''re off skiing somewhere,</span>
  <span m=''931000''>and not noticing what''s happening to your bank account.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''938000''>So, since it''s the rate, the time rate of embezzlement,</span>
  <span m=''942000''>I simply subtract it from this. It''s not w times y because the</span>
  <span m=''947000''>embezzler isn''t stealing a certain fraction of your</span> <span
  m=''951000''>account. It''s simply stealing a certain</span> <span m=''954000''>number
  of dollars every day, the same number of dollars</span> <span m=''959000''>being
  withdrawn for the count. Okay, now, of course,</span> <span m=''963000''>you could
  solve this. This separates variables</span> <span m=''967000''>immediately. You
  get the answer,</span> <span m=''970000''>and there''s no problem with that.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''972000''>Let''s analyze the behavior of the solutions without solving</span>
  <span m=''977000''>the equation by using these two points.</span> </p><p><span m=''980000''>So,
  I want to analyze this equation using the method of</span> <span m=''984000''>critical
  points. So, the first thing I should do</span> <span m=''988000''>is, so, here''s
  our equation, is find the critical points.</span> </p><p><span m=''994000''>Notice
  it''s an autonomous equation all right,</span> <span m=''998000''>because there''s
  no t on the right-hand side.</span> </p><p><span m=''1002000''>Okay, so, the critical
  points, well, that''s where ry minus w</span> <span m=''1008000''>equals zero. In
  other words,</span> <span m=''1011000''>there''s only one critical point, and that
  occurs when y is</span> <span m=''1016000''>equal to w over r. So, that''s the only
  critical</span> <span m=''1021000''>point. Now, I want to know what''s</span> <span
  m=''1025000''>happening to the solution. So, in other words,</span> <span m=''1029000''>if
  I plot, I can write away, of course, negative values</span> <span m=''1034000''>aren''t
  of particularly interesting here,</span> <span m=''1037000''>there is definitely
  a horizontal solution,</span> <span m=''1041000''>and it has the value, it''s at
  the height,</span> <span m=''1045000''>w over r. That''s a solution.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1050000''>The question is, what do the other solutions</span> <span m=''1053000''>look
  like? Now, watch how I make the</span> <span m=''1055000''>analysis because I''m
  going to use two now.</span> </p><p><span m=''1059000''>So, this is step one, then
  step two.</span> </p><p><span m=''1061000''>What do I do? Well, I''m going to graph
  f of y.</span> </p><p><span m=''1065000''>Well, f of y is ry minus w.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1067000''>What does that look like?</span> </p><p><span m=''1070000''>Okay,
  so, here is the y-axis. Notice the y-axis is going</span> <span m=''1075000''>horizontally
  because what I''m interested in is the graph of</span> <span m=''1079000''>this
  function. What do I call the other axis?</span> </p><p><span m=''1084000''>I''m
  going to use the same terminology that is used on the</span> <span m=''1088000''>little
  visual that describes this.</span> </p><p><span m=''1091000''>And, that''s dy. You
  could call this other axis</span> <span m=''1094000''>the f of y axis. That''s not
  a good name for it.</span> </p><p><span m=''1098000''>You could call it the dy /
  dt axis because it''s,</span> <span m=''1102000''>so to speak, the other variable.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1104000''>That''s not great either. But, worst of all would be</span>
  <span m=''1108000''>introducing yet another letter for which we would have no use</span>
  <span m=''1112000''>whatsoever. So, let''s think of it.</span> </p><p><span m=''1117000''>We
  are plotting, now, the graph of f of y.</span> </p><p><span m=''1120000''>f of y
  is this function,</span> <span m=''1123000''>ry minus w. Well, that''s a line.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1128000''>Its intercept is down here at w, and so the graph looks</span>
  <span m=''1133000''>something like this. It''s a line.</span> </p><p><span m=''1135000''>This
  is the line, ry minus w.</span> </p><p><span m=''1139000''>It has slope r. Well,
  what am I going to get</span> <span m=''1145000''>out of that line? Just exactly
  this.</span> </p><p><span m=''1148000''>What am I interested in about that line?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1153000''>Nothing other than where is it above the axis,</span>
  <span m=''1158000''>and where is it below? This function is positive over</span>
  <span m=''1163000''>here, and therefore, I''m going to indicate that</span> <span
  m=''1168000''>symbolically, this, by putting an arrow here.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1175000''>The meeting of this arrow is that y of t is</span> <span m=''1179000''>increasing.
  See where it''s the right-hand</span> <span m=''1183000''>side of that last board?
  y of t is increasing when f of</span> <span m=''1188000''>y is positive. f of y
  is positive here,</span> <span m=''1192000''>and therefore, to the right of this
  point,</span> <span m=''1195000''>it''s increasing. Here to the left of it,</span>
  <span m=''1199000''>f of y is negative, and therefore over here it''s</span> <span
  m=''1203000''>going to be decreasing. What point is this,</span> <span m=''1208000''>in
  fact? Well, that''s where it crosses</span> <span m=''1211000''>the axis. That''s
  exactly the critical</span> <span m=''1215000''>point, w over r. Therefore, what
  this says is</span> <span m=''1219000''>that a solution, once it''s bigger than
  y over r,</span> <span m=''1224000''>it increases, and it increases faster and</span>
  <span m=''1228000''>faster because this function is higher and higher.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1234000''>And, that represents the rate of change.</span> </p><p><span m=''1237000''>So,
  in other words, once the solution,</span> <span m=''1240000''>let''s say a solution
  starts over here at time zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''1244000''>So, this is the
  t axis. And, here is the y axis.</span> </p><p><span m=''1248000''>So, now, I''m
  plotting solutions.</span> </p><p><span m=''1251000''>If it starts at t equals zero,
  above this line,</span> <span m=''1255000''>that is, starts with the value w over
  r,</span> <span m=''1259000''>which is bigger than zero, a value bigger than w over
  r,</span> <span m=''1264000''>then it increases, and increases faster and</span>
  <span m=''1267000''>faster. If it starts below that,</span> <span m=''1272000''>it
  decreases and decreases faster and faster.</span> </p><p><span m=''1276000''>Now,
  in fact, I only have to draw two of</span> <span m=''1280000''>those because what
  do all the others look like?</span> </p><p><span m=''1284000''>They are translations.
  All the other curves look</span> <span m=''1289000''>exactly like those. They are
  just translations of</span> <span m=''1295000''>them. This guy, if I start closer,</span>
  <span m=''1299000''>it''s still going to decrease. Well, that''s supposed to be
  a</span> <span m=''1307000''>translation. Maybe it is.</span> </p><p><span m=''1310000''>So,
  these guys look like that. Let''s do just a tiny bit more</span> <span m=''1317000''>interpretation
  of that. Well, I think I better leave it</span> <span m=''1326000''>there because
  we''ve got harder things to do,</span> <span m=''1333000''>and I want to make sure
  we''ve got time for it.</span> </p><p><span m=''1339000''>Sorry. Okay, next example,</span>
  <span m=''1343000''>a logistic equation. Some of you have already solved</span>
  <span m=''1351000''>this in recitation, and some of you haven''t.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1359000''>This is a population equation. This is the one that section</span>
  <span m=''1364000''>7.1 and section 1.7 is most heavily concerned with,</span> <span
  m=''1368000''>this particular equation. The derivation of it is a</span> <span m=''1372000''>little
  vague. It''s an equation which</span> <span m=''1375000''>describes how population
  increases.</span> </p><p><span m=''1378000''>And one minute, the population behavior
  of some</span> <span m=''1382000''>population, -- -- let''s call it,</span> <span
  m=''1386000''>y is the only thing I know to call anything today,</span> <span m=''1390000''>but
  of course your book uses capital P for population,</span> <span m=''1395000''>to
  get you used to different variables.</span> </p><p><span m=''1398000''>Now, the
  basic population equation runs dy / dt.</span> </p><p><span m=''1402000''>There''s
  a certain growth rate. Let''s call it k y.</span> </p><p><span m=''1406000''>So,
  k is what''s called the growth rate.</span> </p><p><span m=''1409000''>It''s actually,
  sometimes it''s talked about in</span> <span m=''1413000''>terms of birthrate. But,
  it''s the net birth rate.</span> </p><p><span m=''1418000''>It''s the rate at which
  people, or bacteria,</span> <span m=''1422000''>or whatever are being born minus
  the rate at which they are</span> <span m=''1427000''>dying. So, it''s a net birthrate.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1429000''>But, let''s just call it the growth rate.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1433000''>Now, if this is the equation, we can think of this,</span> <span m=''1437000''>if
  k is constant, that''s what''s called simple</span> <span m=''1441000''>population
  growth. And you are all familiar with</span> <span m=''1445000''>that. Logistical
  growth allows for</span> <span m=''1448000''>slightly more complex situations.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1453000''>Logistic growth says that calling k a constant is</span>
  <span m=''1458000''>unrealistic because the Earth is not filled entirely with people.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1466000''>What stops it from having unlimited growth?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1472000''>Well, the fact that the resources, the food,</span> <span m=''1476000''>the
  organism has to live on gets depleted.</span> </p><p><span m=''1481000''>And, in
  other words, the growth rate declines as y</span> <span m=''1486000''>increases.
  As the population increases,</span> <span m=''1490000''>one expects the growth rate
  to decline because resources are</span> <span m=''1496000''>being used up, and they
  are not indefinitely</span> <span m=''1501000''>available. Well, in other words,</span>
  <span m=''1505000''>we should replace k by a function with this behavior.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1509000''>What''s the simplest function that declines as y increases?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1514000''>The simplest choice, and if you are ignorant about</span>
  <span m=''1517000''>what else to do, stick with the simplest,</span> <span m=''1520000''>at
  least you won''t work any harder than you have to,</span> <span m=''1524000''>would
  be to take k equal to the simplest declining function of y</span> <span m=''1529000''>there
  is, which is simply a linear function,</span> <span m=''1532000''>A minus BY. So,
  if I use that as the choice</span> <span m=''1537000''>of the declining growth rate,
  the new equation is dy / dt</span> <span m=''1541000''>equals, here''s my new k.
  The y stays the same,</span> <span m=''1545000''>so the equation becomes a minus
  by, the quantity times y,</span> <span m=''1550000''>or in other words,</span> <span
  m=''1553000''>ay minus b y squared.</span> </p><p><span m=''1555000''>This equation
  is what''s called the logistic equation.</span> </p><p><span m=''1561000''>It has
  many applications, not just to population growth.</span> </p><p><span m=''1565000''>It''s
  applied to the spread of disease, the spread of a rumor,</span> <span m=''1571000''>the
  spread of many things. Yeah, a couple pieces of chalk</span> <span m=''1576000''>here.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1588000''>Okay, now, those of you who have solved it know that
  the</span> <span m=''1594000''>explicit solution involves, well, you separate variables,</span>
  <span m=''1600000''>but you will have to use partial fractions,</span> <span m=''1604000''>ugh,
  I hope you love partial fractions.</span> </p><p><span m=''1608000''>You''re going
  to need them later in the term.</span> </p><p><span m=''1613000''>But, I could avoid
  them now by not solving the equation</span> <span m=''1619000''>explicitly. But
  anyway, you get a solution,</span> <span m=''1623000''>which I was going to write
  on the board for you,</span> <span m=''1626000''>but you could look it up in your
  book.</span> </p><p><span m=''1629000''>It''s unpleasant enough looking to make
  you feel that there must</span> <span m=''1633000''>be an easier way at least to
  get the basic information out.</span> </p><p><span m=''1636000''>Okay, let''s see
  if we can get the basic information out.</span> </p><p><span m=''1640000''>What
  are the critical points? Well, this is pretty easy.</span> </p><p><span m=''1643000''>A,
  I want to set the right-hand side equal to zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''1646000''>So,
  I''m going to solve the equation.</span> </p><p><span m=''1650000''>I can factor
  out a y. It''s going to be y times a</span> <span m=''1655000''>minus by equals
  zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''1659000''>And therefore, the critical points are where
  y</span> <span m=''1663000''>equals zero. That''s one.</span> </p><p><span m=''1667000''>And,
  the other factor is when this factor is zero,</span> <span m=''1672000''>and that
  happens when y is equal to a over b.</span> </p><p><span m=''1679000''>So, there
  are my two critical points.</span> </p><p><span m=''1683000''>Okay, what does, let''s
  start drawing pictures of</span> <span m=''1688000''>solutions. Let''s put it in
  those right</span> <span m=''1692000''>away. Okay, the critical point,</span> <span
  m=''1695000''>zero, gives me a solution that looks like this.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1698000''>And, the critical point, a over b,</span> <span m=''1701000''>those
  are positive numbers. So, that''s somewhere up here.</span> </p><p><span m=''1705000''>So,
  those are two solutions, constant solutions.</span> </p><p><span m=''1709000''>In
  other words, if the population by dumb luck</span> <span m=''1712000''>started at
  zero, it would stay at zero for all</span> <span m=''1715000''>time. That''s not
  terribly surprising.</span> </p><p><span m=''1719000''>But, it''s a little less
  obvious that if it starts at that magic</span> <span m=''1723000''>number, a over
  b, it will also stay at that magic</span> <span m=''1727000''>number for all time
  without moving up or down or away from</span> <span m=''1730000''>it. Now, the question
  is,</span> <span m=''1732000''>therefore, what happens in between?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1734000''>So, for the in between, I''m going to make that same</span> <span
  m=''1738000''>analysis that I made before. And, it''s really not very hard.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1743000''>Look, so here''s my dy/dt-axis. I''ll call that y prime,</span>
  <span m=''1749000''>okay? And, here''s the y-axis.</span> </p><p><span m=''1752000''>So,
  I''m now doing step two. This was step one.</span> </p><p><span m=''1756000''>Okay,
  the function that I want to graph is this one,</span> <span m=''1761000''>ay minus
  b y squared, or in factor form,</span> <span m=''1766000''>y times a minus by.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1769000''>Now, this function, we know, has a zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1772000''>It has a zero here, and it has a zero at the point</span> <span m=''1777000''>a
  over b. At these two critical points,</span> <span m=''1783000''>it has a zero.
  What is it doing in between?</span> </p><p><span m=''1786000''>Well, in between,
  it''s a parabola.</span> </p><p><span m=''1789000''>It''s a quadratic function.
  It''s a parabola.</span> </p><p><span m=''1792000''>Does it go up or does it go
  down?</span> </p><p><span m=''1795000''>Well, when y is very large, it''s very negative.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1799000''>That means it must be a downward-opening parabola.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1804000''>And therefore, this curve looks like this.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1807000''>So, I''m interested in knowing, where is it positive,</span> <span
  m=''1812000''>and where is it negative? Well, it''s positive,</span> <span m=''1816000''>here,
  for this range of values of y.</span> </p><p><span m=''1819000''>Since it''s positive
  there, it will be increasing there.</span> </p><p><span m=''1824000''>Here, it''s
  negative, and therefore it will be</span> <span m=''1828000''>decreasing. Here,
  it''s negative,</span> <span m=''1832000''>and therefore, dy / dt will be negative
  also,</span> <span m=''1836000''>and therefore the function, y, will be decreasing
  here.</span> </p><p><span m=''1841000''>So, how do these other solutions look?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1844000''>Well, we can put them in. I''ll put them in in white,</span>
  <span m=''1849000''>okay, because this has got to last until the end of the term.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1854000''>So, how are they doing? They are increasing between the</span>
  <span m=''1859000''>two curves. They are not allowed to cross</span> <span m=''1864000''>either
  of these yellow curves. But, they are always</span> <span m=''1868000''>increasing.
  Well, if they''re always</span> <span m=''1871000''>increasing, they must start
  here and increase,</span> <span m=''1875000''>and not allowed to cross. It must
  do something like that.</span> </p><p><span m=''1879000''>This must be a translation
  of it.</span> </p><p><span m=''1882000''>In other words, the curves must look like
  that.</span> </p><p><span m=''1886000''>Those are supposed to be translations of
  each other.</span> </p><p><span m=''1892000''>I know they aren''t, but use your
  imaginations.</span> </p><p><span m=''1895000''>But what''s happening above? So
  in other words,</span> <span m=''1898000''>if I start with a population anywhere
  bigger than zero but</span> <span m=''1902000''>less than a over b, it increases
  asymptotically to</span> <span m=''1906000''>the level a over b. What happens if
  I start above</span> <span m=''1910000''>that? Well, then it decreases to it</span>
  <span m=''1912000''>because, this way, for the values of y bigger than</span> <span
  m=''1916000''>a over b, it decreases as time increases.</span> </p><p><span m=''1920000''>So,
  these guys up here are doing this.</span> </p><p><span m=''1924000''>And, how about
  the ones below the axis?</span> </p><p><span m=''1926000''>Well, they have no physical
  significance.</span> </p><p><span m=''1929000''>But let''s put them in anyway. Whether
  they doing?</span> </p><p><span m=''1932000''>They are decreasing away from zero.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1935000''>So, these guys don''t mean anything physically,</span>
  <span m=''1938000''>but mathematically they exist. Their solutions,</span> <span
  m=''1941000''>they''re going down like that. Now, you notice from this</span> <span
  m=''1945000''>picture that there are, even though both of these are</span> <span
  m=''1949000''>constant solutions, they have dramatically</span> <span m=''1952000''>different
  behavior. This one, this solution,</span> <span m=''1957000''>is the one that all
  other solutions try to approach as</span> <span m=''1961000''>time goes to infinity.
  This one, the solution zero,</span> <span m=''1965000''>is repulsive, as it were.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1968000''>Any solution that starts near zero, if it starts at zero,</span>
  <span m=''1972000''>of course, it stays there for all time, but if it starts just</span>
  <span m=''1978000''>a little bit above zero, it increases to a over b.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1982000''>This is called a stable</span> <span m=''1985000''>solution because
  everybody tries to get closer and closer to it.</span> </p><p><span m=''1991000''>This
  is called, zero is also a constant</span> <span m=''1994000''>solution, but this
  is an unstable solution.</span> </p><p><span m=''1997000''>And now, usually, solution
  is too general a word.</span> </p><p><span m=''2001000''>I think it''s better to
  call it a stable critical point,</span> <span m=''2006000''>and an unstable critical
  point. But, of course,</span> <span m=''2010000''>it also corresponds to a solution.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2014000''>So, critical points are not all the same.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2017000''>Some are stable, and some are unstable.</span> </p><p><span m=''2020000''>And,
  you can see which is which just by looking at this picture.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2026000''>If the arrows point towards them, you''ve got a stable</span> <span
  m=''2031000''>critical point. If it arrows point away from</span> <span m=''2035000''>them,
  you''ve got an unstable critical point.</span> </p><p><span m=''2038000''>Now, there
  is a third possibility.</span> </p><p><span m=''2043000''>Okay, I think we''d better
  address it because otherwise</span> <span m=''2049000''>you''re going to sit there
  wondering, hey,</span> <span m=''2053000''>what did he do? Suppose it looks like
  this.</span> </p><p><span m=''2058000''>Suppose it were just tangent. Well, this
  is the picture of</span> <span m=''2064000''>that curve, the pink curve. What would
  the arrows look like</span> <span m=''2071000''>then? What would the arrows look
  like</span> <span m=''2075000''>then? Well, since they are positive,</span> <span
  m=''2078000''>it''s always positive, the arrow goes like this.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2081000''>And then on the side, it also goes in the same</span> <span m=''2085000''>direction.
  So, is this critical point</span> <span m=''2087000''>stable or unstable? It''s
  stable if you approach it</span> <span m=''2091000''>from the left. So, how, in
  fact,</span> <span m=''2093000''>do the curves, how would the corresponding</span>
  <span m=''2097000''>curves look? Well, there''s our long-term</span> <span m=''2100000''>solution.
  This corresponds to that point.</span> </p><p><span m=''2105000''>Let''s call this
  a, and then this will be the</span> <span m=''2110000''>value, a. If I start below
  it,</span> <span m=''2114000''>I rise to it. If I start above it,</span> <span m=''2118000''>I
  increase. So, if I start above it,</span> <span m=''2122000''>I do this. Well, now,
  that''s stable on one</span> <span m=''2127000''>side, and unstable on the other.
  And, that''s indicated by saying</span> <span m=''2135000''>it''s semi-stable. That''s
  a brilliant word.</span> </p><p><span m=''2140000''>I wonder how long it to do think
  that one up,</span> <span m=''2143000''>semi-stable critical point: stable on one
  side,</span> <span m=''2146000''>unstable on the other depending on whether you
  start below it.</span> </p><p><span m=''2150000''>And, of course, it could be reversed
  if I had</span> <span m=''2153000''>drawn the picture the other way. I could have
  approached it from</span> <span m=''2157000''>the top, and left it from below. You
  get the idea of the</span> <span m=''2163000''>behavior. Okay, let''s now take,</span>
  <span m=''2168000''>I''m going to soup up this logistic equation just a little</span>
  <span m=''2176000''>bit more. So, let''s talk about the</span> <span m=''2181000''>logistic
  equation. But, I''m going to add to it</span> <span m=''2188000''>harvesting, with
  harvesting. So, this is a very late 20th</span> <span m=''2196000''>century concept.
  So, we imagine,</span> <span m=''2199000''>for example, a bunch of formerly free
  range</span> <span m=''2203000''>Atlantic salmon penned in one of these huge factory
  farms off the</span> <span m=''2209000''>coast of Maine or someplace. They''ve made
  salmon much</span> <span m=''2214000''>cheaper than it used to be, but at a certain
  cost to the</span> <span m=''2220000''>salmon, and possibly to our environment.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2225000''>So, what happens? Well, the salmon grow,</span> <span
  m=''2228000''>and grow, and do what salmon do.</span> </p><p><span m=''2231000''>And,
  they are harvested. That''s a word somewhere in the</span> <span m=''2235000''>category
  of ethnic cleansing in my opinion.</span> </p><p><span m=''2239000''>But, it''s,
  again, a very 20th-century word.</span> </p><p><span m=''2243000''>I think it was
  Hitler who discovered that,</span> <span m=''2247000''>that all you had to do was
  call something by a sanitary name,</span> <span m=''2252000''>and no matter how
  horrible it was, good bourgeois people would</span> <span m=''2257000''>accept it.
  So, the harvesting,</span> <span m=''2262000''>which means, of course, picking them
  up and</span> <span m=''2267000''>killing them, and putting them in cans and</span>
  <span m=''2272000''>stuff like that, okay, so what''s the equation?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2278000''>I''m going to assume that the harvest is at a constant time</span>
  <span m=''2285000''>rate. In other words,</span> <span m=''2288000''>it''s not a
  certain fraction of all the salmon that are being</span> <span m=''2293000''>caught
  each day and canned. The factory has a certain</span> <span m=''2297000''>capacity,
  so, 400 pounds of salmon each day</span> <span m=''2301000''>are pulled out and
  canned. So, it''s a constant time rate.</span> </p><p><span m=''2305000''>That means
  that the equation is now going to be dy/dt is equal</span> <span m=''2311000''>to,
  well, salmon grow logistically.</span> </p><p><span m=''2315000''>ay minus b y squared,
  so, that part of the</span> <span m=''2319000''>equation is the same. But, I need
  a term to take care</span> <span m=''2324000''>of this constant harvesting rate,
  and that will be h.</span> </p><p><span m=''2328000''>Let''s call it h, not h times
  y.</span> </p><p><span m=''2330000''>Then, I would be harvesting a certain fraction
  of all the</span> <span m=''2335000''>salmon there, which is not what I''m doing.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2340000''>Okay: our equation. Now, I want to analyze what the</span>
  <span m=''2343000''>critical points of this look like.</span> </p><p><span m=''2345000''>Now,
  this is a little more subtle because there''s now a new</span> <span m=''2349000''>parameter,
  there. And, what I want to see is how</span> <span m=''2352000''>that varies with
  the new parameter.</span> </p><p><span m=''2355000''>The best thing to do is, I
  mean, the thing not to do is</span> <span m=''2359000''>make this equal to zero,
  fiddle around with the</span> <span m=''2362000''>quadratic formula, get some massive
  expression,</span> <span m=''2365000''>and then spend the next half hour scratching
  your head trying</span> <span m=''2369000''>to figure out what it means, and what
  information you are</span> <span m=''2373000''>supposed to be getting out of it.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2377000''>Draw pictures instead. Draw pictures.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2380000''>If h is zero, that''s the smallest harvesting</span> <span m=''2385000''>rate
  I could have. The picture looks like our old</span> <span m=''2390000''>one. So,
  if h is zero,</span> <span m=''2392000''>the picture looks like, what color did
  I,</span> <span m=''2396000''>okay, pink. Yellow.</span> </p><p><span m=''2400000''>Yellow
  is the cheapest, but I can''t find it.</span> </p><p><span m=''2403000''>Okay, yellow
  is commercially available.</span> </p><p><span m=''2406000''>These are precious.
  All right, purple if it''s okay,</span> <span m=''2411000''>purple. So, this is
  the one,</span> <span m=''2413000''>our original one corresponding to h equals zero.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2417000''>Or, in other words, it''s the equation ay minus b y</span>
  <span m=''2421000''>squared. h is zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''2424000''>Now, if
  I want to find, I now want to increase the</span> <span m=''2428000''>value of h,
  well, if I increase the value of h,</span> <span m=''2432000''>in other words, harvest
  more and more,</span> <span m=''2435000''>what''s happening? Well, I simply lower
  this</span> <span m=''2441000''>function by h. So, if I lower h somewhat,</span>
  <span m=''2445000''>it will come to here. So, this is some value,</span> <span m=''2449000''>ay
  minus b y squared minus h1,</span> <span m=''2454000''>let''s say. That''s this
  curve.</span> </p><p><span m=''2457000''>If I lower it a lot, it will look like
  this.</span> </p><p><span m=''2463000''>So, ay minus b y squared minus h a lot,
  h twenty.</span> </p><p><span m=''2468000''>This doesn''t mean anything.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2471000''>Two. Obviously, there''s one</span> <span m=''2474000''>interesting
  value to lower it by.</span> </p><p><span m=''2477000''>It''s a value which would
  lower it exactly by this amount.</span> </p><p><span m=''2482000''>Let me put that
  in special. If I lower it by just that</span> <span m=''2487000''>amount, the curve
  always looks the same.</span> </p><p><span m=''2492000''>It''s just been lowered.
  I''m going to say this one is,</span> <span m=''2496000''>so this one is the same
  thing, except that I''ve subtracted h</span> <span m=''2502000''>sub m. Where is
  h sub m on</span> <span m=''2506000''>the picture? Well, I lowered it by this</span>
  <span m=''2509000''>amount. So, this height is h sub m.</span> </p><p><span m=''2513000''>In
  other words, if I find the maximum height</span> <span m=''2517000''>here, which
  is easy to do because it''s a parabola,</span> <span m=''2521000''>and lower it
  by exactly that amount, I will have lowered it</span> <span m=''2527000''>to this
  point. This will be a critical point.</span> </p><p><span m=''2532000''>Now, the
  question is, what''s happened to the critical</span> <span m=''2536000''>point as
  I did this? I started with the critical</span> <span m=''2540000''>points here and
  here. As I lower h,</span> <span m=''2542000''>the critical point changed to this
  and that.</span> </p><p><span m=''2546000''>And now, it changed to this one when
  I got to the purple line.</span> </p><p><span m=''2552000''>And, as I went still
  further down, there were no critical</span> <span m=''2556000''>points. So, this
  curve has no critical</span> <span m=''2558000''>points attached to it. What are
  the corresponding</span> <span m=''2562000''>pictures? Well, the corresponding</span>
  <span m=''2564000''>pictures, well, we''ve already drawn,</span> <span m=''2567000''>the
  picture for h equals zero is drawn already.</span> </p><p><span m=''2571000''>The
  pictures that I''m talking about are how the solutions</span> <span m=''2575000''>look.
  How would the solution look</span> <span m=''2577000''>like for this one for h one?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2580000''>For h1, the solutions look like, here is a over b.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2586000''>Here is a over b, but the critical points aren''t</span>
  <span m=''2590000''>at zero and a over b anymore. They''ve moved in a little bit.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2595000''>So, they are here and here. And, otherwise,</span> <span
  m=''2598000''>the solutions look just like they did before,</span> <span m=''2602000''>and
  the analysis is the same. And, similarly,</span> <span m=''2605000''>if h two goes
  very far, if h2 is very large,</span> <span m=''2609000''>there are no critical
  points. h, too large,</span> <span m=''2613000''>no critical points. Are the solutions
  decreasing</span> <span m=''2618000''>all the time or increasing? Well, they are
  always</span> <span m=''2622000''>decreasing because the function is always negative.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2626000''>Solutions always go down, always.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2629000''>The interesting one is this last one, where I decreased it</span>
  <span m=''2634000''>just to (h)m. And, what happens there is</span> <span m=''2637000''>there
  is this certain, magic critical point whose</span> <span m=''2641000''>value we
  could calculate. There''s one constant solution.</span> </p><p><span m=''2647000''>So,
  this is one that has the value.</span> </p><p><span m=''2650000''>Sorry, I''m calculating
  the solutions out.</span> </p><p><span m=''2653000''>So, y here and t here, so here
  it is value,</span> <span m=''2657000''>(h)m is the value by which it has been lowered.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2660000''>So, this is the picture for (h)m.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2663000''>And, how do the solutions look? Well, to the right of that,</span>
  <span m=''2669000''>they are decreasing. And, to the left they are also</span> <span
  m=''2673000''>decreasing because this function is always negative.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2677000''>So, the solutions look like this, if you start above,</span> <span
  m=''2682000''>and if you start below, they decrease.</span> </p><p><span m=''2685000''>And,
  of course, they can''t get lower than zero</span> <span m=''2689000''>because these
  are salmon. What is the significance of</span> <span m=''2693000''>(h)m? (h)m is
  the maximum rate of</span> <span m=''2696000''>harvesting. It''s an extremely important</span>
  <span m=''2699000''>number for this industry. If the maximum time rate at</span>
  <span m=''2705000''>which you can pull the salmon daily out of the water,</span>
  <span m=''2709000''>and can them without what happening?</span> </p><p><span m=''2712000''>Without
  the salmon going to zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''2715000''>As long as you start
  above, and don''t harvest it more than</span> <span m=''2720000''>this rate, it
  will be following these curves.</span> </p><p><span m=''2723000''>You will be following
  these curves, and you will still have</span> <span m=''2728000''>salmon. If you
  harvest just a little</span> <span m=''2731000''>bit more, you will be on this curve
  that has no critical</span> <span m=''2736000''>points, and the salmon in the tank
  will decrease to zero.</span> </p>'
