title: 'Lecture 20: Derivative Formulas'
transcript: '<p><span m=''18000''>Okay, those are the formulas. You will get all of
  those on</span> <span m=''23000''>the test, plus a couple more that I will give
  you today.</span> </p><p><span m=''29000''>Those will be the basic formulas of the
  Laplace</span> <span m=''33000''>transform. If I think you need anything</span>
  <span m=''37000''>else, I''ll give you other stuff, too.</span> </p><p><span m=''42000''>So,
  I''m going to leave those on the board all period.</span> </p><p><span m=''46000''>The
  basic test for today is to see how Laplace transforms are</span> <span m=''51000''>used
  to solve linear differential equations with</span> <span m=''54000''>constant coefficients.
  Now, to do that,</span> <span m=''57000''>we''re going to have to take the Laplace
  transform of a</span> <span m=''62000''>derivative. And, in order to make sense
  of</span> <span m=''66000''>that procedure, we''re going to have to ask,</span>
  <span m=''69000''>I apologize in advance, but a slightly theoretical</span> <span
  m=''72000''>question, namely, we have to have some guarantee</span> <span m=''75000''>in
  advance that the Laplace transform is going to exist.</span> </p><p><span m=''79000''>Now,
  how could the Laplace transform fail to exist?</span> </p><p><span m=''83000''>Can''t
  I always calculate this? And the answer is,</span> <span m=''86000''>no, you can''t
  always calculate it because this is an improper</span> <span m=''90000''>integral.
  I''m integrating all the way up</span> <span m=''93000''>to infinity, and you know
  that improper integrals don''t always</span> <span m=''98000''>converge. You know,
  if the integrand for</span> <span m=''102000''>example just didn''t have the exponential
  factor there,</span> <span m=''106000''>were simply t dt, that it might look like
  it made</span> <span m=''110000''>sense, but that integral doesn''t converge.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''113000''>And, anyway, it has no value.</span> </p><p><span m=''116000''>So,
  I need conditions in advance, which guarantee that</span> <span m=''120000''>the
  Laplace transforms will exist.</span> </p><p><span m=''124000''>Only under those
  circumstances will the formulas make any</span> <span m=''127000''>sense. Now, there
  is a standard</span> <span m=''129000''>condition that''s in your book. But, I didn''t
  get a chance to</span> <span m=''133000''>talk about it last time. So, I thought
  I''d better spent</span> <span m=''136000''>the first few minutes today talking
  about the condition</span> <span m=''140000''>because it''s what we''re going to
  need in order to be able to</span> <span m=''143000''>solve differential equations.
  The condition that makes the</span> <span m=''147000''>Laplace transform definitely
  exist for a function is that f</span> <span m=''151000''>of t shouldn''t grow too
  rapidly.</span> </p><p><span m=''155000''>It can grow rapidly. It can grow because
  the e to</span> <span m=''158000''>the minus s t is pulling it down,</span> <span
  m=''161000''>trying hard to pull it down to zero to make the integral</span> <span
  m=''165000''>converge. All we have to do is to</span> <span m=''167000''>guarantee
  that it doesn''t grow so rapidly that the e to the</span> <span m=''172000''>minus
  s t is powerless to pull it down.</span> </p><p><span m=''174000''>Now, the condition
  is it''s what''s called a growth</span> <span m=''178000''>condition. These are
  very important in</span> <span m=''182000''>applications, and unfortunately,</span>
  <span m=''184000''>it''s always taught in 18.01, but it''s not always taught in</span>
  <span m=''189000''>high school calculus. And, it''s a question of how</span> <span
  m=''193000''>fast the function is allowed to grow.</span> </p><p><span m=''196000''>And,
  the condition is universally said this way,</span> <span m=''200000''>should be
  of exponential type. So, what I''m defining is the</span> <span m=''204000''>phrase
  "exponential type." I''ll put it in quotation marks for</span> <span m=''209000''>that
  reason. What does this mean?</span> </p><p><span m=''213000''>It''s a condition,
  a growth condition on a</span> <span m=''216000''>function, says how fast it can
  get big.</span> </p><p><span m=''220000''>It says that f of t in size, since f of
  t might get</span> <span m=''224000''>negatively very large, and that would hurt,</span>
  <span m=''228000''>make the integral hard to converge, not likely to</span> <span
  m=''232000''>converge, use the absolute value.</span> </p><p><span m=''234000''>In
  other words, I don''t care if f of t is going</span> <span m=''238000''>up or going
  down very low. Whichever way it goes,</span> <span m=''242000''>its size should
  not be bigger than a rapidly growing</span> <span m=''246000''>exponential. And,
  here''s a rapidly growing</span> <span m=''250000''>exponential. c is some positive
  constant,</span> <span m=''254000''>for some positive constant c and some positive
  constant k.</span> </p><p><span m=''258000''>And, this should be true for all values
  of t.</span> </p><p><span m=''260000''>All t greater than or equal to zero.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''262000''>I don''t have to worry about negative values of t because
  the</span> <span m=''266000''>integral doesn''t care about them.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''268000''>I''m only doing the integration as t runs from zero to infinity.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''273000''>In other words, f of t could have been</span> <span m=''278000''>an
  extremely wild function, sewn a lot of oats or whatever</span> <span m=''284000''>functions
  do for negative values of t, and we don''t care.</span> </p><p><span m=''291000''>It''s
  only what''s happening from now from time zero onto</span> <span m=''297000''>infinity.
  As long as it behaves now,</span> <span m=''301000''>from now on, it''s okay.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''305000''>All right, so, the way it should behave is by</span> <span
  m=''307000''>being an exponential type. Now, to try to give you some</span> <span
  m=''311000''>feeling for what this means, these functions,</span> <span m=''314000''>for
  example, if k is 100,</span> <span m=''316000''>do you have any idea what the plot
  of e to the 100t</span> <span m=''320000''>looks like? It goes straight up.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''323000''>On every computer you try to plot it on, e to the 100t</span>
  <span m=''326000''>goes like that unless, of course,</span> <span m=''329000''>you
  make the scale t equals zero to, over here,</span> <span m=''332000''>is one millionth.
  Well, even that won''t do.</span> </p><p><span m=''337000''>Okay, so these functions
  really can grow quite rapidly.</span> </p><p><span m=''341000''>Let''s take an example
  and see what''s of exponential type,</span> <span m=''346000''>and then perhaps
  even more interestingly,</span> <span m=''350000''>what isn''t. The function sine
  t,</span> <span m=''353000''>is that of exponential type? Well, sure.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''357000''>Its absolute value is always less than or equal to one.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''361000''>So, it''s also this paradigm. If I take c equal to one,</span> <span
  m=''366000''>and what should I take k to be? Zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''371000''>Take
  k to be zero, c equals one,</span> <span m=''373000''>and in fact sine t plays that
  condition.</span> </p><p><span m=''378000''>Here''s one that''s more interesting,
  t to the n.</span> </p><p><span m=''383000''>Think of t to the 100th power.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''386000''>Is that smaller than some exponential with maybe a</span>
  <span m=''391000''>constant out front? Well, t to the 100th power</span> <span m=''395000''>goes
  straight up, also.</span> </p><p><span m=''397000''>Well, we feel that if we make
  the exponential big enough,</span> <span m=''401000''>maybe it will win out. In
  fact, you don''t have to make</span> <span m=''405000''>the exponential big. k equals
  one is good</span> <span m=''408000''>enough. In other words,</span> <span m=''409000''>I
  don''t have to put absolute value signs around the t to the</span> <span m=''413000''>n
  because I''m only thinking about t as being a</span> <span m=''417000''>positive
  number, anyway.</span> </p><p><span m=''420000''>I say that that''s less than or
  equal to some constant M,</span> <span m=''424000''>positive constant M times e
  to the t will be good</span> <span m=''430000''>enough for some M and all t. Now,
  why is that?</span> </p><p><span m=''434000''>Why is that? The way to think of that,</span>
  <span m=''437000''>so, what this proves is that, therefore, t to the n</span> <span
  m=''442000''>is of exponential type, which we could have guessed</span> <span m=''447000''>because
  after all we were able to calculate its Laplace</span> <span m=''451000''>transform.
  Now, just because you can</span> <span m=''456000''>calculate the Laplace transform
  doesn''t mean it''s of exponential</span> <span m=''461000''>type, but in practical
  matters, it almost always does.</span> </p><p><span m=''466000''>So, t to the n
  is of exponential type.</span> </p><p><span m=''470000''>How do you prove that?
  Well, the weighted secret is to</span> <span m=''475000''>look at t to the n divided
  by e to the t.</span> </p><p><span m=''479000''>In other words, look at the quotient.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''484000''>What I''d like to argue is that this is bounded by some
  number,</span> <span m=''491000''>capital M. That''s the question I''m asking.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''495000''>Now, why is this so? Well, I think I can convince</span>
  <span m=''501000''>you of it without having to work very hard.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''506000''>What does the graph of this function look like?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''513000''>It starts here, so I''m graphing this function,</span> <span m=''517000''>this
  ratio. When t is equal to zero,</span> <span m=''521000''>its value is zero, right,
  because of the</span> <span m=''525000''>numerator. What happens as t goes to</span>
  <span m=''528000''>infinity? What happens to this?</span> </p><p><span m=''531000''>What
  does it approach? Zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''534000''>And, why? By L''Hop.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''536000''>By L''Hopital''s rule. Just keep differentiating,</span>
  <span m=''541000''>reapply the rule over and over, keep differentiating it n</span>
  <span m=''546000''>times, and finally you''ll have won the numerator down to t to</span>
  <span m=''552000''>the zero, which isn''t doing anything</span> <span m=''557000''>much.
  And, the denominator,</span> <span m=''561000''>no matter how many times you differentiate
  it,</span> <span m=''565000''>it''s still t, to the t all the time.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''567000''>So, by using Lopital''s rule n times, you change the top to one</span>
  <span m=''572000''>or n factorial, actually; the bottom stays e to</span> <span
  m=''576000''>the t, and the ratio clearly</span> <span m=''579000''>approaches zero,
  and therefore,</span> <span m=''581000''>it approached zero to start with.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''585000''>So, I don''t know what this function''s doing in between.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''588000''>It''s a positive function. It''s continuous because the
  top</span> <span m=''591000''>and bottom are continuous, and the bottom is never
  zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''594000''>So, it''s a continuous function which starts
  out at zero and is</span> <span m=''598000''>positive, and as t goes to infinity,
  it gets closer and</span> <span m=''601000''>closer to the t-axis, again.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''603000''>Well, what does t to the n do?</span> </p><p><span m=''606000''>It
  might wave around. It doesn''t actually.</span> </p><p><span m=''610000''>But, the
  point is, because it''s continuous,</span> <span m=''615000''>starts at zero, ends
  at zero,</span> <span m=''619000''>it''s bounded. It has a maximum somewhere.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''623000''>And, that maximum is M. So, it has a maximum.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''630000''>All you have to know is where it starts, and where it ends up,</span>
  <span m=''634000''>and the fact that it''s continuous.</span> </p><p><span m=''637000''>That
  guarantees that it has a maximum.</span> </p><p><span m=''639000''>So, it is less
  than some maximum, and that shows that</span> <span m=''643000''>it''s of exponential
  type. Now, of course,</span> <span m=''646000''>before you get the idea that everything''s
  of exponential</span> <span m=''650000''>type, let''s see what isn''t. I''ll give
  you two functions</span> <span m=''654000''>that are not of exponential type, for
  different reasons.</span> </p><p><span m=''660000''>One over t is not of exponential
  type.</span> </p><p><span m=''663000''>Well, of course, it''s not defined that t
  equals</span> <span m=''666000''>zero. But, you know,</span> <span m=''668000''>it''s
  okay for an integral not to be defined at one point</span> <span m=''672000''>because
  you''re measuring an area, and when you measure an</span> <span m=''676000''>area,
  what happened to one point doesn''t really matter much.</span> </p><p><span m=''680000''>That''s
  not the thing. What''s wrong with one over t is</span> <span m=''684000''>that the
  integral doesn''t converge at zero times one over</span> <span m=''688000''>t dt.
  That integral,</span> <span m=''692000''>when t is near zero, this is approximately
  equal to</span> <span m=''696000''>one, right? If t is zero,</span> <span m=''698000''>this
  is one. So, it''s like the function,</span> <span m=''701000''>integral from zero
  to infinity of one over t,</span> <span m=''706000''>near zero it''s close to,</span>
  <span m=''710000''>it''s like the integral from zero to someplace of no</span> <span
  m=''714000''>importance, dt over t.</span> </p><p><span m=''717000''>But, this does
  not converge. This is like log t,</span> <span m=''721000''>and log zero is minus
  infinity. So, it doesn''t converge.</span> </p><p><span m=''728000''>So, one over
  t is not of exponential type.</span> </p><p><span m=''731000''>So, what''s the Laplace
  transform of one over t?</span> </p><p><span m=''734000''>It doesn''t have a Laplace</span>
  <span m=''737000''>transform. Well, what if I put t equals</span> <span m=''740000''>negative
  n? What about t to the minus one?</span> </p><p><span m=''743000''>Well, that only
  works for</span> <span m=''746000''>positive integers, not negative integers.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''750000''>Okay, so it''s not of exponential type.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''753000''>However, that''s because it never really gets started</span> <span
  m=''757000''>properly. It''s more fun to look at a</span> <span m=''760000''>function
  which is not of exponential type because it</span> <span m=''765000''>grows too
  fast. Now, what''s a function that</span> <span m=''769000''>grows faster that it
  grows so rapidly that you can''t find any</span> <span m=''774000''>function e to
  the k t which bounds it?</span> </p><p><span m=''778000''>A function which grows
  too rapidly, a simple one is e to</span> <span m=''783000''>the t squared, grows
  too rapidly to be of</span> <span m=''787000''>exponential type. And, the argument
  is simple.</span> </p><p><span m=''793000''>No matter what you propose, it''s always,</span>
  <span m=''797000''>for the K, no matter how big a number, use Avogadro''s number,</span>
  <span m=''802000''>use anything you want. Ultimately, this is going to be</span>
  <span m=''807000''>bigger than k t no matter how big k is, no matter how big k</span>
  <span m=''812000''>is. When is this going to happen?</span> </p><p><span m=''816000''>This
  will happen if t squared is bigger than k t.</span> </p><p><span m=''820000''>In
  other words, as soon as t becomes bigger</span> <span m=''823000''>than k, you might
  have to wait quite a while for that to</span> <span m=''827000''>happen, but, as
  soon as t gets bigger than 10 to the 10 to the</span> <span m=''832000''>23, this
  e to the t squared will be</span> <span m=''835000''>bigger than e to the 10 to
  the 10 to the 23 times t.</span> </p><p><span m=''840000''>So, e to the t squared,</span>
  <span m=''844000''>it''s a simple function, a simple elementary</span> <span m=''847000''>function.
  It grows so rapidly it doesn''t</span> <span m=''850000''>have a Laplace transform.
  Okay, so how are we going to</span> <span m=''853000''>solve differential equations
  if e to the t squared?</span> </p><p><span m=''856000''>I won''t give you any. And,
  the reason I won''t give</span> <span m=''859000''>you any: because I never saw
  one occur in real life.</span> </p><p><span m=''862000''>Nature, like sines, cosines,
  exponentials,</span> <span m=''865000''>are fine, I''ve never seen a physical, you
  know,</span> <span m=''868000''>this is just my ignorance. But, I''ve never seen
  a physical</span> <span m=''871000''>problem that involved a function growing as
  rapidly as e to the t</span> <span m=''875000''>squared. That may be just my ignorance.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''880000''>But, I do know the Laplace transform won''t be used to
  solve</span> <span m=''884000''>differential equations involving such a function.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''888000''>How about e to the minus t squared?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''892000''>That''s different. It looks almost the same,</span> <span m=''895000''>but
  e to the minus t squared does this.</span> </p><p><span m=''898000''>It''s very
  well-behaved. That''s the curve,</span> <span m=''902000''>of course, that you''re
  all afraid of.</span> </p><p><span m=''904000''>Don''t panic. Okay.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''907000''>So, I''d like to explain to you now how differential equations,</span>
  <span m=''913000''>maybe I should save-- I''ll tell you what.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''917000''>We need more formulas. So, I''ll put them,</span> <span m=''920000''>why
  don''t I save this board, and instead,</span> <span m=''924000''>I''ll describe
  to you the basic way Laplace transforms are used</span> <span m=''930000''>to solve
  differential equations, what are they called,</span> <span m=''935000''>a paradigm.
  I''ll show you the paradigm,</span> <span m=''939000''>and then we''ll fill in the
  holes so you have some overall</span> <span m=''943000''>view of how the procedure
  goes, and then you''ll understand</span> <span m=''946000''>where the various pieces
  fit into it.</span> </p><p><span m=''948000''>I think you''ll understand it better
  that way.</span> </p><p><span m=''951000''>So, what do we do? Start with the differential</span>
  <span m=''954000''>equation. But, right away,</span> <span m=''955000''>there''s
  a fundamental difference between what the</span> <span m=''958000''>Laplace transform
  does, and what we''ve been doing up</span> <span m=''961000''>until now, namely,
  what you have to start with is</span> <span m=''964000''>not merely the differential
  equation.</span> </p><p><span m=''968000''>Let''s say we have linear with constant
  coefficients.</span> </p><p><span m=''972000''>It''s almost never used to solve
  any other type of problem.</span> </p><p><span m=''976000''>And, let''s take second
  order so I don''t have to do,</span> <span m=''980000''>because that''s the kind
  we''ve been working with all term.</span> </p><p><span m=''985000''>But, it''s allowed
  to be inhomogeneous,</span> <span m=''988000''>so, f of t. Let''s call the something
  else,</span> <span m=''992000''>another letter, h of t.</span> </p><p><span m=''996000''>I''ll
  want f of t for the function I''m taking the</span> <span m=''999000''>Laplace transform
  of. All right, now,</span> <span m=''1002000''>the difference is that up to now,
  you know techniques for</span> <span m=''1005000''>solving this just as it stands.
  The Laplace transform does not</span> <span m=''1010000''>know how to solve this
  just doesn''t stands.</span> </p><p><span m=''1012000''>The Laplace transform must
  have an initial value problem.</span> </p><p><span m=''1016000''>In other words,
  you must supply from the</span> <span m=''1019000''>beginning the initial conditions
  that the y is to satisfy.</span> </p><p><span m=''1024000''>Now, I don''t want to
  say any specific numbers,</span> <span m=''1026000''>so I''ll use generic numbers.
  Well, but look,</span> <span m=''1028000''>what do we do if we get a problem and
  there are no initial</span> <span m=''1032000''>conditions; does that mean we can''t
  use the Laplace transform?</span> </p><p><span m=''1035000''>No, of course you can
  use it. But, you will just have to</span> <span m=''1038000''>assume the initial
  conditions are on the numbers.</span> </p><p><span m=''1041000''>You''ll say it
  but the initial conditions be y sub zero</span> <span m=''1044000''>and y zero prime,
  or whatever,</span> <span m=''1046000''>a and b, whatever you want to call it.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1050000''>And now, the answer, then, will involve the a and</span>
  <span m=''1054000''>the b or the y zero and the y zero prime.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1058000''>But, you must, at least, give lip service to</span> <span m=''1062000''>the
  initial conditions, whereas before we didn''t have</span> <span m=''1066000''>to
  do that. Now, depending on your point of</span> <span m=''1070000''>view, that''s
  a grave defect, or it is, so what?</span> </p><p><span m=''1074000''>Let''s adopt
  the so what point of view.</span> </p><p><span m=''1077000''>So, there''s our problem.
  It''s an initial value problem.</span> </p><p><span m=''1083000''>How is it solved
  by the Laplace transform?</span> </p><p><span m=''1085000''>Well, the idea is you
  take the Laplace transform of this</span> <span m=''1089000''>differential equation
  and the initial conditions.</span> </p><p><span m=''1092000''>So, I''m going to
  explain to you how to do that.</span> </p><p><span m=''1095000''>Not right now,
  because we''re going to need,</span> <span m=''1097000''>first, the Laplace transform
  of a derivative,</span> <span m=''1100000''>the formula for that. You don''t know
  that yet.</span> </p><p><span m=''1103000''>But when you do know it, you will be
  able to take the</span> <span m=''1106000''>Laplace transform of the initial value
  problem.</span> </p><p><span m=''1109000''>So, I''ll put the little l here, and
  what comes out is,</span> <span m=''1112000''>well, y of t is the solution to the
  original</span> <span m=''1116000''>problem. If y of t is the</span> <span m=''1119000''>function
  which satisfies that equation and these initial</span> <span m=''1123000''>conditions,
  its Laplace transform, let''s call it capital</span> <span m=''1128000''>Y, that''s
  our standard notation, but it''s going to be of a new</span> <span m=''1132000''>variable,
  s. So, when I take the Laplace</span> <span m=''1135000''>transform of the differential
  equation with the initial</span> <span m=''1139000''>conditions, what comes out
  is an algebraic-- the emphasis is on</span> <span m=''1144000''>algebraic: no derivatives,
  no transcendental functions,</span> <span m=''1148000''>nothing like that, an algebraic
  equation,</span> <span m=''1151000''>m Y of s.</span> </p><p><span m=''1162000''>And,
  now what? Well, now, in the domain of s,</span> <span m=''1165000''>it''s easy to
  solve this algebraic equation.</span> </p><p><span m=''1168000''>Not all algebraic
  equations are easy to solve for the capital Y.</span> </p><p><span m=''1173000''>But,
  the ones you will get will always be, not because I am</span> <span m=''1177000''>making
  life easy for you, but that''s the way the Laplace</span> <span m=''1182000''>transform
  works. So, you will solve it for Y.</span> </p><p><span m=''1185000''>And, the answer
  will always come out to be Y equals,</span> <span m=''1189000''>Y of s equals some
  rational function,</span> <span m=''1192000''>some quotient of polynomials in s,
  a polynomial in s divided by</span> <span m=''1197000''>some other polynomial in
  s.</span> </p><p><span m=''1209000''>And, now what? Well, this is the Laplace</span>
  <span m=''1212000''>transform of the answer. This is the Laplace transform</span>
  <span m=''1217000''>of the solution we are looking for.</span> </p><p><span m=''1220000''>So,
  the final step is to go backwards by taking the inverse</span> <span m=''1225000''>Laplace
  transform of this guy. And, what will you get?</span> </p><p><span m=''1230000''>Well,
  you will get y equals the y of t that we are</span> <span m=''1235000''>looking
  for. It''s really a wildly improbable</span> <span m=''1239000''>procedure. In other
  words,</span> <span m=''1241000''>instead of going from here to here, you have to
  imagine</span> <span m=''1245000''>there''s a mountain here. And, the only way to
  get around</span> <span m=''1248000''>it is to go, first, here, and then cross the
  stream</span> <span m=''1251000''>here, and then go back up, and go back up.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1254000''>It looks like a senseless procedure, what do they call
  it,</span> <span m=''1258000''>going around Robin Hood''s barn, it was called when
  I was a,</span> <span m=''1261000''>I don''t know why it''s called that.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1265000''>But that''s what we used to call it; not Laplace transform.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1269000''>That was just a generic thing when you had to do something</span>
  <span m=''1274000''>like this. But, the answer is that it''s</span> <span m=''1278000''>hard
  to go from here to here, but trivial to go from here to</span> <span m=''1283000''>here.
  This solution step is the</span> <span m=''1285000''>easiest step of all. This is
  not very hard.</span> </p><p><span m=''1289000''>It''s easy, in fact. This is easy
  and</span> <span m=''1293000''>straightforward. This is trivial,</span> <span m=''1296000''>essentially,
  yeah, trivial.</span> </p><p><span m=''1298000''>But, this step is the hard step.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1301000''>This is where you have to use partial fractions,</span>
  <span m=''1305000''>look up things in the table to get back there so that most of</span>
  <span m=''1310000''>the work of the procedure isn''t going from here to here.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1315000''>Going from here to there is a breeze.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1320000''>Okay, now, in order to implement this,</span> <span m=''1322000''>what
  is it we have to do? Well, the basic thing is I have</span> <span m=''1325000''>to
  explain to you, you already know at least a</span> <span m=''1328000''>little bit,
  a reasonable amount of technique for taking that</span> <span m=''1332000''>step
  if you went to recitation yesterday and practiced a little</span> <span m=''1336000''>bit.
  This part, I assure you,</span> <span m=''1337000''>is nothing. So, all I have to
  do now is</span> <span m=''1340000''>explain to you how to take the Laplace transform
  of the</span> <span m=''1343000''>differential equation. And, that really means,</span>
  <span m=''1346000''>how do you take the Laplace transform of a derivative?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1351000''>So, that''s our problem. What I want to form,</span>
  <span m=''1355000''>in other words, is a formula for the Laplace</span> <span m=''1359000''>transform
  f prime of t.</span> </p><p><span m=''1363000''>Now, in terms of what? Well, since
  f is an arbitrary</span> <span m=''1368000''>function, the only thing I could hope
  for is somehow to express</span> <span m=''1374000''>the Laplace transform of the
  derivative in terms of the</span> <span m=''1380000''>Laplace transform of the original
  function.</span> </p><p><span m=''1386000''>So, that''s what I''m aiming for. Okay,
  where are we going to</span> <span m=''1390000''>start? Well, starting is easy because</span>
  <span m=''1392000''>we know nothing. If you don''t know anything,</span> <span m=''1395000''>then
  there''s no place to start but the definition.</span> </p><p><span m=''1398000''>Since
  I know nothing whatever about the function f of t,</span> <span m=''1402000''>and
  I want to calculate the Laplace transform,</span> <span m=''1406000''>I''d better
  start with the definition.</span> </p><p><span m=''1410000''>Whatever this is, it''s
  the integral from zero to</span> <span m=''1413000''>infinity of e to the minus
  s t times f prime of t dt.</span> </p><p><span m=''1419000''>Now, what am I looking
  for? I''m looking for somehow to</span> <span m=''1423000''>transform this so that
  what appears here is not</span> <span m=''1427000''>f prime of t, which I''m clueless
  about, but f of t</span> <span m=''1430000''>because if this were f of t, this expression
  would be the</span> <span m=''1434000''>Laplace transform of f of t.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1436000''>And, I''m assuming I know that. So, the question is how do I</span>
  <span m=''1442000''>take this and somehow do something clever to it that</span>
  <span m=''1445000''>turns this into f of t instead of f prime of t?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1450000''>Now, to first the question that</span> <span m=''1453000''>way, I
  hope I would get 100% response on what to do.</span> </p><p><span m=''1456000''>But,
  I''ll go for 1%. So, what should I do?</span> </p><p><span m=''1460000''>I want
  to change that, so that instead of f prime of t,</span> <span m=''1463000''>f of
  t appears there instead.</span> </p><p><span m=''1467000''>What should I do? Integrate
  by parts,</span> <span m=''1471000''>the most fundamental procedure in advanced
  analysis.</span> </p><p><span m=''1475000''>Everything important and interesting
  depends on</span> <span m=''1479000''>integration by parts. And, when you consider
  that</span> <span m=''1483000''>integration by parts is nothing more than just the
  formula for</span> <span m=''1488000''>the derivative of a product read backwards,
  it''s amazing.</span> </p><p><span m=''1493000''>It never fails to amaze me, but
  it''s okay.</span> </p><p><span m=''1496000''>That''s what mathematics are so great.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1499000''>Okay, so let''s use integration by parts.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1504000''>Integration by parts: okay, so, we have to decide,</span> <span m=''1506000''>of
  course, there''s no doubt that this is the factor we want</span> <span m=''1510000''>to
  integrate, which means we have to be</span> <span m=''1512000''>willing to differentiate
  this factor.</span> </p><p><span m=''1514000''>But that will be okay because it
  looks practically,</span> <span m=''1517000''>like any exponential, it looks practically
  the same</span> <span m=''1520000''>after you''ve differentiated it. So, let''s
  do the work.</span> </p><p><span m=''1523000''>First step is you don''t do the differentiation.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1526000''>You only do the integration. So, the first step is e
  to the</span> <span m=''1529000''>negative s t. And, the integral of f prime of</span>
  <span m=''1534000''>t is just f of t.</span> </p><p><span m=''1536000''>And, that''s
  to be evaluated between the limits zero and</span> <span m=''1540000''>infinity.
  And then, minus,</span> <span m=''1542000''>again, before you forget it, put down
  that minus sign.</span> </p><p><span m=''1545000''>The integral between the limits
  of what you get by doing both</span> <span m=''1549000''>operations, both the differentiation
  and the</span> <span m=''1552000''>integration. So, the differentiation will be</span>
  <span m=''1555000''>by using the chain rule. Remember, I''m differentiating</span>
  <span m=''1559000''>with respect to t. The variable is t here,</span> <span m=''1563000''>not
  s. s is just a parameter.</span> </p><p><span m=''1566000''>It''s just a constant,
  a variable constant,</span> <span m=''1569000''>if you get my meaning. That''s not
  an oxymoron.</span> </p><p><span m=''1573000''>A variable constant: a parameter
  is a variable</span> <span m=''1576000''>constant, variable because you can manipulate
  the little slider</span> <span m=''1581000''>and make a change its value, right?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1584000''>That''s why it''s variable. It''s not a variable.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1588000''>It''s variable, if you get the distinction.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1593000''>Okay, well, I mean, it becomes a variable</span> <span m=''1595000''>[LAUGHTER].
  But right now,</span> <span m=''1597000''>it''s not a variable. It''s just sitting
  there in the</span> <span m=''1601000''>integral. All right, so,</span> <span m=''1603000''>minus
  s, e to the negative s t, f of t dt.</span> </p><p><span m=''1607000''>Now, this
  part''s easy.</span> </p><p><span m=''1609000''>The interesting thing is this expression.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1612000''>So, and the most interesting thing is I have to evaluate
  it</span> <span m=''1616000''>at infinity. Now, of course,</span> <span m=''1618000''>that
  means take the limit as you go towards,</span> <span m=''1621000''>as you let t
  goes to infinity. Now, so what I''m interested in</span> <span m=''1627000''>knowing
  is what''s the limit of that expression?</span> </p><p><span m=''1630000''>I''ll
  write it as f of t divided by e to the s t.</span> </p><p><span m=''1633000''>Remember,
  s is a positive</span> <span m=''1636000''>number. s t goes to infinity,</span>
  <span m=''1638000''>and I want to know what the limit of that is.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1641000''>Well, the limit is what it is. But really, if that limit isn''t</span>
  <span m=''1645000''>zero, I''m in deep trouble since the whole process is out of</span>
  <span m=''1649000''>control. What will make that limit zero?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1653000''>Well, that f of t should not grow faster than e to</span> <span m=''1657000''>the
  s t if s is a big enough number.</span> </p><p><span m=''1661000''>And now, that''s
  just what will happen if f of t is of</span> <span m=''1665000''>exponential type.
  It''s for this step right here</span> <span m=''1668000''>that is the most crucial
  place at which we need to know that f</span> <span m=''1673000''>of t is of exponential
  type. So, that limit is zero since f</span> <span m=''1677000''>of t is of exponential
  type, in other words,</span> <span m=''1681000''>that the value, the absolute value
  of f of t,</span> <span m=''1684000''>becomes less than, let''s say, put in the
  c if you</span> <span m=''1689000''>want, but it''s not very important, c e to the
  k t</span> <span m=''1693000''>efor all values of t. And, therefore,</span> <span
  m=''1698000''>this will go to zero as soon as s becomes bigger than that k.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1702000''>In other words,</span> <span m=''1703000''>if f of t
  isn''t growing any faster than e to the</span> <span m=''1707000''>k t , then as
  soon as s is a number,</span> <span m=''1710000''>that parameter has the value bigger
  than k,</span> <span m=''1713000''>this ratio is going to go to zero because the
  denominator</span> <span m=''1717000''>will always be bigger than the numerator,
  and getting bigger</span> <span m=''1721000''>faster. So, this goes to zero if s
  is</span> <span m=''1725000''>bigger than k. At the upper limit,</span> <span m=''1728000''>therefore,
  this is zero. Again, assuming that s is</span> <span m=''1732000''>bigger than that
  k, the k of the exponential type,</span> <span m=''1737000''>how about at the lower
  limit? We''re used to seeing zero</span> <span m=''1741000''>there, but we''re not
  going to get zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''1744000''>If I plug in t equals zero,
  this factor becomes one.</span> </p><p><span m=''1749000''>And, what happens to
  that one? f of zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''1753000''>You mean, I''m going to have
  to know what f of zero is before I</span> <span m=''1758000''>can take the Laplace
  transform of this derivative?</span> </p><p><span m=''1762000''>The answer is yes,
  and that''s why you have to have</span> <span m=''1766000''>an initial value problem.
  You have to know in advance</span> <span m=''1770000''>what the value of the function
  that you are looking for is at</span> <span m=''1774000''>zero because it enters
  into the formula.</span> </p><p><span m=''1777000''>I didn''t make up these rules;
  I''m just following them.</span> </p><p><span m=''1780000''>So, what''s the rest?
  The two negatives cancel,</span> <span m=''1783000''>and you get plus s. It''s just
  a parameter,</span> <span m=''1787000''>so I can pull it out of the integral.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1789000''>I''m integrating with respect to t, and what''s left
  is,</span> <span m=''1793000''>well, what is left? If I take out minus s,</span>
  <span m=''1796000''>combine it there, I get what''s left is just the</span> <span
  m=''1799000''>Laplace transform of the function I started with.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1804000''>So, it''s F of s. And, that''s the magic formula</span> <span m=''1810000''>for
  the Laplace transform of the derivative.</span> </p><p><span m=''1815000''>So, it''s
  worth putting up on our little list.</span> </p><p><span m=''1820000''>So, f prime
  of t, assuming it''s of exponential</span> <span m=''1826000''>type, has as its
  Laplace transform, well,</span> <span m=''1831000''>what is it? Let''s put down
  the major part</span> <span m=''1835000''>of it is s times whatever the Laplace
  transform of the</span> <span m=''1839000''>original function, F of t,</span> <span
  m=''1841000''>was. So, I take the original Laplace</span> <span m=''1844000''>transform.
  When I multiply it by s,</span> <span m=''1846000''>that corresponds to taking the
  derivative.</span> </p><p><span m=''1849000''>But there''s also that little extra
  piece.</span> </p><p><span m=''1851000''>I must know the value of the starting value
  of the function.</span> </p><p><span m=''1855000''>This is the formula you''ll used
  to take a Laplace transform of</span> <span m=''1860000''>the differential equation.
  Now, but you see I''m not done</span> <span m=''1865000''>yet because that will
  take care of the term a y prime.</span> </p><p><span m=''1869000''>But, I don''t
  know what the Laplace transform of the second</span> <span m=''1873000''>derivative
  is. Okay, so, we need a formula for</span> <span m=''1876000''>the Laplace transform
  of a second derivative as well as the</span> <span m=''1880000''>first. Now, the
  hack method is to say,</span> <span m=''1883000''>secondary, all right. I''ve got
  to do this.</span> </p><p><span m=''1885000''>I''ll second derivative here, second
  derivative here,</span> <span m=''1889000''>what do I do with that? Ah-ha, I integrate
  by parts</span> <span m=''1893000''>twice. Yes, you can do that.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1894000''>But that''s a hack method. And, of course,</span> <span m=''1900000''>I
  know you''re too smart to do that.</span> </p><p><span m=''1905000''>What you would
  do instead is-- How are we going to fill that</span> <span m=''1913000''>in? Well,
  a second derivative is</span> <span m=''1918000''>also a first derivative. A second
  derivative is the</span> <span m=''1927000''>first derivative of the first derivative.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1934000''>Okay, now, we''ll just call this glop, something.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1942000''>So, it''s glop prime. What is the formula for the</span>
  <span m=''1951000''>Laplace transform of glop prime? It is, well,</span> <span m=''1959000''>I
  have my formula. It is the glop prime.</span> </p><p><span m=''1963000''>The formula
  for it is s times the Laplace transform of glop,</span> <span m=''1970000''>okay,
  glop. Well, glop is f prime of t.</span> </p><p><span m=''1975000''>I''m not done
  yet,</span> <span m=''1978000''>minus glop evaluated at zero. What''s glop evaluated
  at zero?</span> </p><p><span m=''1985000''>Well, f prime of zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1990000''>Now, I don''t want the formula in that form,</span> <span m=''1993000''>but
  I have to have it in that form because I know what the</span> <span m=''1997000''>Laplace
  transform of f prime of t is.</span> </p><p><span m=''2000000''>I just calculated
  that. So, this is equal to s times</span> <span m=''2004000''>the Laplace transform
  of f prime of t, which is s times F of s,</span> <span m=''2008000''>capital F of
  s, minus f of zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''2011000''>All that bracket stuff</span>
  <span m=''2014000''>corresponds to this guy. And, don''t forget the stuff</span>
  <span m=''2018000''>that''s tagging along, minus f prime of zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2022000''>And now, put that all together.</span> </p><p><span m=''2025000''>What
  is it going to be? Well, there''s the principal</span> <span m=''2029000''>term
  which consists of s squared multiplied by F of s.</span> </p><p><span m=''2034000''>That''s
  the main part of it.</span> </p><p><span m=''2036000''>And, the rest is the sort
  of fellow travelers.</span> </p><p><span m=''2040000''>So, we have minus s times
  f of zero,</span> <span m=''2044000''>little term tagging along. This is a constant
  times s.</span> </p><p><span m=''2050000''>And then, we''ve got another one, still
  another constant.</span> </p><p><span m=''2054000''>So, what we have is to calculate
  the Laplace transform</span> <span m=''2058000''>of the second derivative, I need
  to know both f of zero</span> <span m=''2062000''>and f prime of zero, exactly the
  initial</span> <span m=''2067000''>conditions that the problem was given for the
  initial value</span> <span m=''2071000''>problem. But, notice,</span> <span m=''2073000''>there''s
  a principal part of it. That''s the s squared F of s.</span> </p><p><span m=''2077000''>That''s
  the guts of it,</span> <span m=''2079000''>so to speak. The rest of it,</span> <span
  m=''2081000''>you know, you might hope that these two numbers are zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2084000''>It could happen, and often it is made to happen</span> <span m=''2087000''>and
  problems to simplify them. And I case, you don''t have to</span> <span m=''2091000''>worry;
  they''re not there. But, if they are there,</span> <span m=''2094000''>you must
  put them in or you get the wrong answer.</span> </p><p><span m=''2096000''>So, that''s
  the list of formulas.</span> </p><p><span m=''2100000''>So, those formulas on the
  top board and these two extra ones,</span> <span m=''2106000''>those are the things
  you will be working with on Friday.</span> </p><p><span m=''2112000''>But I stress,
  the Laplace transform won''t be</span> <span m=''2117000''>a big part of the exam.
  The exam, of course,</span> <span m=''2122000''>doesn''t exist, let''s say a maximum
  of 20%,</span> <span m=''2127000''>maybe 15. I don''t know,</span> <span m=''2129000''>give
  or take a few points. Yeah, what''s a point or two?</span> </p><p><span m=''2137000''>Okay,
  let''s solve, yeah, we have time.</span> </p><p><span m=''2141000''>We have time
  to solve a problem.</span> </p><p><span m=''2144000''>Let''s solve a problem. See,
  I can''t touch that.</span> </p><p><span m=''2149000''>It''s untouchable. Okay,
  this, we''ve got to keep.</span> </p><p><span m=''2174000''>Problem? Okay.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2199000''>Okay, now you know how to solve this problem by operators.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2203000''>Let me just briefly remind you of the basic steps.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2207000''>You have to do two separate tasks.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2210000''>You have to first solve the homogeneous equation,</span> <span m=''2214000''>putting
  a zero there. That''s the first thing you</span> <span m=''2218000''>learned to
  do. That''s easy.</span> </p><p><span m=''2220000''>You could almost do that in
  your head now.</span> </p><p><span m=''2225000''>You get the characteristic polynomial,
  get its roots,</span> <span m=''2228000''>get the two functions, e to the t and
  e to the</span> <span m=''2231000''>negative t, which are the solutions.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2234000''>You make up c1 times one, and c2 times the other.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2238000''>That''s the complementary function that solves the</span>
  <span m=''2241000''>homogeneous problem. And then you have to find a</span> <span
  m=''2244000''>particular solution. Can you see what would happen</span> <span m=''2247000''>if
  you try to find the particular solution?</span> </p><p><span m=''2250000''>The number
  here is negative one, right?</span> </p><p><span m=''2254000''>Negative one is a
  root of the characteristic polynomial,</span> <span m=''2257000''>so you''ve got
  to use that extra formula.</span> </p><p><span m=''2260000''>It''s okay. That''s
  why I gave it to you.</span> </p><p><span m=''2262000''>You''ve used the exponential
  input theorem with the extra</span> <span m=''2266000''>formula. Then, you will
  get the</span> <span m=''2268000''>particular solution. And now, you have to make
  the</span> <span m=''2271000''>general solution. The particular solution plus</span>
  <span m=''2274000''>the complementary function, and now you are ready to put in</span>
  <span m=''2278000''>the initial conditions. At the very end,</span> <span m=''2282000''>when
  you''ve got the whole general solution,</span> <span m=''2285000''>now you put in,
  not before, you put in the</span> <span m=''2287000''>initial conditions. You have
  to calculate the</span> <span m=''2291000''>derivative of that thing and substitute
  this.</span> </p><p><span m=''2294000''>You take it as it stands to substitute this.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2297000''>You get a pair of simultaneous equations for c1 and c2.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2301000''>You solve them: answer.</span> </p><p><span m=''2302000''>It''s
  a rather elaborate procedure, which has at least</span> <span m=''2306000''>three
  or four separate steps, all of which,</span> <span m=''2309000''>of course, must
  be done correctly.</span> </p><p><span m=''2313000''>Now, the Laplace transform,
  instead, feeds the entire</span> <span m=''2317000''>problem into the Laplace transform
  machine.</span> </p><p><span m=''2320000''>You follow that little blue pattern,
  and you come out with</span> <span m=''2324000''>the answer. So, let''s do the Laplace</span>
  <span m=''2327000''>transform way. Okay, so, the first step is to</span> <span m=''2331000''>say,
  if here''s my unknown function, y of t,</span> <span m=''2335000''>it obeys this
  law, and here are its starting</span> <span m=''2338000''>values, a bit of its derivative.
  What I''m going to take is the</span> <span m=''2343000''>Laplace transform of this
  equation.</span> </p><p><span m=''2346000''>In other words, I''ll take the Laplace
  transform</span> <span m=''2349000''>of this side, and this side also.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2351000''>And, they must be equal because if they were equal to start</span>
  <span m=''2355000''>with, the Laplace transforms also have to be equal.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2358000''>Okay, so let''s take the Laplace transform of this equation.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2362000''>Okay, first ID the Laplace transform of the second</span>
  <span m=''2365000''>derivative. Okay, that''s going to be,</span> <span m=''2367000''>don''t
  forget the principal terms.</span> </p><p><span m=''2371000''>There is some people
  who get so hypnotized by this.</span> </p><p><span m=''2374000''>I just know I''m
  going to forget this.</span> </p><p><span m=''2376000''>So, they read it. Then they
  forget this.</span> </p><p><span m=''2378000''>But that''s everything. That''s the
  important part.</span> </p><p><span m=''2381000''>Okay, so it''s s times, I''m calling
  the Laplace</span> <span m=''2384000''>transform not capital F but capital Y because
  my original</span> <span m=''2388000''>function is called little y. So, it''s s
  squared Y.</span> </p><p><span m=''2391000''>It''s Y of s, but I''m not going to
  put that,</span> <span m=''2394000''>the of s in because it just makes the thing
  look more</span> <span m=''2398000''>complicated. And now, before you forget,</span>
  <span m=''2402000''>you have to put in the rest. So, minus s times the value at</span>
  <span m=''2406000''>zero, which is one, minus the value of the</span> <span m=''2410000''>derivative.
  But, that''s zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''2412000''>So, this is not too hard a
  problem.</span> </p><p><span m=''2415000''>So, minus s minus zero, so I don''t have
  to put that</span> <span m=''2419000''>in. So, all this is the Laplace</span> <span
  m=''2422000''>transform of y double prime.</span> </p><p><span m=''2425000''>And
  now, minus the Laplace transform of y,</span> <span m=''2429000''>well, that''s
  just capital Y. What''s that equal to?</span> </p><p><span m=''2435000''>The Laplace
  transform of the right-hand side.</span> </p><p><span m=''2440000''>Okay, look up
  the formula. It is e to the negative t,</span> <span m=''2445000''>a is minus one,
  so, it''s one over s minus minus</span> <span m=''2451000''>one; so, it is s plus
  one.</span> </p><p><span m=''2457000''>This is that. Okay, the next thing we have
  to</span> <span m=''2462000''>do is solve for Y. That doesn''t look too hard.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2465000''>Solve it for y. Okay, the best thing to do is</span>
  <span m=''2468000''>put s squared, group all the Y terms together</span> <span m=''2471000''>unless
  you''re really quite a good calculator.</span> </p><p><span m=''2474000''>Maybe
  make one extra line out of it.</span> </p><p><span m=''2477000''>Yeah, definitely
  do this. And then, the extra garbage I</span> <span m=''2481000''>refer to as the
  garbage, this stuff, and this stuff,</span> <span m=''2485000''>the stuff, the linear
  polynomials which are tagging</span> <span m=''2488000''>along move to the right-hand
  side because they don''t involve</span> <span m=''2492000''>capital Y. So, this
  we will move to the</span> <span m=''2497000''>other side. And so, that''s equal
  to (one</span> <span m=''2500000''>over (s plus one)) plus s.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2504000''>Now, you have a basic choice. About half the time,</span> <span m=''2508000''>it''s
  a good idea to combine these terms.</span> </p><p><span m=''2511000''>The other
  half of the time, it''s not a good idea to combine</span> <span m=''2516000''>those
  terms. So, how do we know whether to</span> <span m=''2519000''>do it or not to
  do it? Experience, which you will get</span> <span m=''2523000''>by solving many,
  many problems.</span> </p><p><span m=''2526000''>Okay, I''m going to combine them
  because I think it''s a good</span> <span m=''2531000''>thing to do here. So, what
  is that?</span> </p><p><span m=''2535000''>That''s s squared plus s plus one.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2540000''>So, it''s s squared plus s plus one divided by s plus
  one,</span> <span m=''2545000''>okay? I''m still not done because now</span> <span
  m=''2548000''>we have to know, what''s Y?</span> </p><p><span m=''2551000''>All
  right, now we have to think.</span> </p><p><span m=''2555000''>What we''re going
  to do is get Y in this form.</span> </p><p><span m=''2558000''>But, I want it in
  the form in which it''s most suited for using</span> <span m=''2562000''>partial
  fractions. In other words,</span> <span m=''2564000''>I want the denominator as
  factored as I possibly can be.</span> </p><p><span m=''2568000''>Okay, well, the
  numerator is going to be just what it was.</span> </p><p><span m=''2572000''>How
  should I write the denominator?</span> </p><p><span m=''2575000''>Well, the denominator
  is going to have the factor s plus one</span> <span m=''2579000''>in it from here.
  But after I divide through,</span> <span m=''2584000''>the other factor will be
  s squared minus one,</span> <span m=''2589000''>right? But, s squared minus one
  is s</span> <span m=''2592000''>minus one times s plus one.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2597000''>So, I have to divide this by s squared minus one.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2603000''>Factored, it''s this. So, the end result is there are</span> <span
  m=''2607000''>two of these and one of the other.</span> </p><p><span m=''2612000''>And
  now, it''s ready to be used. It''s better to be a partial</span> <span m=''2616000''>fraction.
  So, the final step is to use a</span> <span m=''2620000''>partial fraction''s decomposition
  on this so that you can</span> <span m=''2624000''>calculate its inverse Laplace
  transform.</span> </p><p><span m=''2628000''>So, let''s do that. Okay, (s squared
  plus s plus</span> <span m=''2631000''>one) divided by that thing, (s plus one)
  squared times (s</span> <span m=''2636000''>minus one) equals s plus</span> <span
  m=''2641000''>one squared plus s plus one plus s minus one.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2647000''>In the top will be constants,</span> <span m=''2652000''>just constants.
  Let''s do it this way first,</span> <span m=''2655000''>and I''ll say at the very
  end, something else.</span> </p><p><span m=''2658000''>Maybe now. Many of you are
  upset.</span> </p><p><span m=''2661000''>Some of you are upset. I know this for
  a fact because</span> <span m=''2665000''>in high school, or wherever you learned
  to do</span> <span m=''2668000''>this before, there weren''t two terms here.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2673000''>There was just one term, s plus one squared.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2676000''>If you do it that way,</span> <span m=''2679000''>then it''s all right.
  Then, it''s all right,</span> <span m=''2682000''>but I don''t recommend it. In
  that case,</span> <span m=''2685000''>the numerators will not be constants.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2688000''>But, if you just have that, then because this is a</span>
  <span m=''2692000''>quadratic polynomial all by itself.</span> </p><p><span m=''2694000''>You''ve
  got to have a linear polynomial, a s plus b</span> <span m=''2699000''>in the top,
  see?</span> </p><p><span m=''2702000''>So, you must have a s plus b here,</span>
  <span m=''2704000''>as I''m sure you remember if that''s the way you learned to
  do</span> <span m=''2708000''>it. But, to do cover-up,</span> <span m=''2709000''>the
  best way as much as possible to separate out the</span> <span m=''2712000''>terms.
  If this were a cubic term,</span> <span m=''2714000''>God forbid, s plus one cubed,</span>
  <span m=''2716000''>then you''d have to have s plus one cubed,</span> <span m=''2720000''>s
  plus one squared.</span> </p><p><span m=''2723000''>Okay, I won''t give you anything
  bigger than quadratic.</span> </p><p><span m=''2726000''>[LAUGHTER] You can trust
  me.</span> </p><p><span m=''2729000''>Okay, now, what can we find by the cover up
  method?</span> </p><p><span m=''2733000''>Well, surely this. Cover up the s minus
  one,</span> <span m=''2737000''>put s equals one, and I get three divided by two</span>
  <span m=''2742000''>squared, four. So, this is three quarters.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2745000''>Now, in this,</span> <span m=''2748000''>you can always find the highest
  power by cover-up because,</span> <span m=''2752000''>cover it up, put s equals
  negative one,</span> <span m=''2756000''>and you get one minus one plus one.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2762000''>So, one up there, negative one here makes</span> <span
  m=''2764000''>negative two here. So, one over negative two.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2767000''>So, it''s minus one half.</span> </p><p><span m=''2769000''>Now, this
  you cannot determine</span> <span m=''2772000''>by cover-up because you''d want
  to cover-up just one of these s</span> <span m=''2776000''>plus ones. But then you
  can''t put s equals</span> <span m=''2779000''>negative one because you get infinity.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2782000''>You get zero there, makes infinity.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2784000''>So, this must be determined some other way,</span> <span m=''2787000''>either
  by undetermined coefficients,</span> <span m=''2789000''>or if you''ve just got
  one thing, for heaven''s sake,</span> <span m=''2792000''>just make a substitution.
  See, this is supposed to be</span> <span m=''2797000''>true. This is an algebraic
  identity,</span> <span m=''2800000''>true for all values of the variable, and therefore,</span>
  <span m=''2803000''>it ought to be true when s equals zero,</span> <span m=''2807000''>for
  instance. Why zero?</span> </p><p><span m=''2808000''>Well, because I haven''t used
  it yet.</span> </p><p><span m=''2811000''>I used negative one and positive one,</span>
  <span m=''2813000''>but I didn''t use zero. Okay, let''s use zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2816000''>Put s equals zero. What do we get?</span> </p><p><span m=''2820000''>Well,
  on the left-hand side, I get one divided by one</span> <span m=''2823000''>squared,
  negative. So, I get minus one on the left</span> <span m=''2826000''>hand side equals,
  what do I get on the right?</span> </p><p><span m=''2829000''>Put s equals zero,
  you get negative one half.</span> </p><p><span m=''2832000''>Well, this is the number
  I''m</span> <span m=''2835000''>trying to find. So, let''s write that simply as</span>
  <span m=''2838000''>plus c, putting s equals zero. s equals zero here gives me</span>
  <span m=''2841000''>negative three quarters.</span> </p><p><span m=''2843000''>Okay,
  what''s c? This is minus a half,</span> <span m=''2846000''>minus three quarters,
  is minus five quarters.</span> </p><p><span m=''2849000''>Put it on the other side,</span>
  <span m=''2852000''>minus one plus five quarters is plus one quarter.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2855000''>So, c equals one quarter.</span> </p><p><span m=''2859000''>And now,
  we are ready to do the</span> <span m=''2862000''>final step. Take the inverse Laplace</span>
  <span m=''2864000''>transform. You see what I said when I said</span> <span m=''2867000''>that
  all the work is in this last step?</span> </p><p><span m=''2869000''>Just look how
  much of the work, how much of the board is</span> <span m=''2873000''>devoted to
  the first two steps, and how much is going to be</span> <span m=''2877000''>devoted
  to the last step? Okay, so we get e to the</span> <span m=''2881000''>inverse Laplace
  transform. Well, the first term is the</span> <span m=''2885000''>hardest. Let''s
  let that go for the</span> <span m=''2888000''>moment. So, I leave a space for it,</span>
  <span m=''2890000''>and then we will have one quarter.</span> </p><p><span m=''2893000''>Well,
  one over s plus one is,</span> <span m=''2896000''>that''s just the exponential
  formula.</span> </p><p><span m=''2899000''>One over s plus one would be e to the
  negative t,e to the minus</span> <span m=''2904000''>one times t. So, it''s one
  quarter e to the</span> <span m=''2908000''>minus one times t.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2912000''>And, how about the next thing would be three quarters times,</span>
  <span m=''2916000''>well, here it''s negative one, so that''s e to the plus t.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2921000''>Notice how those signs work.</span> </p><p><span m=''2924000''>And,
  that just leaves us the Laplace transform of this thing.</span> </p><p><span m=''2929000''>Now,
  you look at it and you say, this Laplace transform</span> <span m=''2934000''>happened
  in two steps. I took something and I got,</span> <span m=''2938000''>essentially,
  one over s squared.</span> </p><p><span m=''2943000''>And then, I changed s to s
  plus one.</span> </p><p><span m=''2948000''>All right, what gives one over s squared?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2953000''>The Laplace transform of what is one over s squared?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2958000''>t, you say to yourself, one over s to some power is</span>
  <span m=''2963000''>essentially some power of t. And then, you look at the</span>
  <span m=''2968000''>formula. Notice at the top is one</span> <span m=''2971000''>factorial,
  which is one, of course.</span> </p><p><span m=''2974000''>Okay, now, then how do
  I convert this to one over s plus</span> <span m=''2979000''>one squared? That''s
  the exponential shift</span> <span m=''2984000''>formula. If you know what the Laplace</span>
  <span m=''2987000''>transform, so the first formula in the middle of the board on</span>
  <span m=''2991000''>the top, there, if you know what,</span> <span m=''2994000''>change
  s to s plus one, corresponds to</span> <span m=''2998000''>multiplying by e to the
  t.</span> </p><p><span m=''3003000''>So, it is t times e to the negative t.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3006000''>Sorry, that corresponds to this.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''3008000''>So, this is the exponential shift formula.</span> </p><p><span m=''3011000''>If
  t goes to one over s squared, then t e to the</span> <span m=''3015000''>minus t
  goes to one over s plus one squared.</span> </p><p><span m=''3020000''>Okay, but
  there''s a constant</span> <span m=''3022000''>out front. So, it''s minus one half
  t e to</span> <span m=''3025000''>the negative t.</span> </p><p><span m=''3027000''>Now,
  tell me, what parts of this solution,</span> <span m=''3030000''>oh boy, we''re
  over time. But, notice,</span> <span m=''3032000''>this is what would have been
  the particular solution,</span> <span m=''3036000''>(y)p before, and this is the
  stuff that</span> <span m=''3039000''>occurs in the complementary function, but
  already the</span> <span m=''3042000''>appropriate constants have been supplied
  for the coefficients.</span> </p><p><span m=''3049000''>You don''t have to calculate
  them separately.</span> </p><p><span m=''3052000''>They were built into the method.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3054000''>Okay, good luck on Friday, and see you there.</span>
