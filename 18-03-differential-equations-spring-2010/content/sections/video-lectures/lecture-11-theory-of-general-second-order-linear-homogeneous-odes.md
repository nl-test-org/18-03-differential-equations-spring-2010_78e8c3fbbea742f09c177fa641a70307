transcript: '<p><span m=''0''>y prime and y double prime.</span> </p><p><span m=''4000''>So,
  q of x times y equal zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''9000''>The linearity of the equation,
  that is, the form in which it</span> <span m=''15000''>appears is going to be the
  key idea today.</span> </p><p><span m=''20000''>Today is going to be theoretical,
  but some of the</span> <span m=''25000''>ideas in it are the most important in the
  course.</span> </p><p><span m=''32000''>So, I don''t have to apologize for the theory.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''37000''>Remember, the solution method was to find two independent
  y</span> <span m=''45000''>one, y two independent solutions.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''51000''>And now, I''ll formally write out what independent means.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''60000''>There are different ways to say it.</span> </p><p><span m=''63000''>But
  for you, I think the simplest and most</span> <span m=''67000''>intelligible will
  be to say that y2 is not to be a constant</span> <span m=''72000''>multiple of y1.
  And, unfortunately,</span> <span m=''75000''>it''s necessary to add, nor is y1 to
  be a constant</span> <span m=''80000''>multiple. I have to call it by different</span>
  <span m=''84000''>constants. So, let''s call this one c prime</span> <span m=''88000''>of
  y2. Well, I mean,</span> <span m=''91000''>the most obvious question is, well, look.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''95000''>If this is not a constant times that, this can''t be there</span>
  <span m=''101000''>because I would just use one over c if it was.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''106000''>Unfortunately, the reason I have to write it</span> <span m=''111000''>this
  way is to take account of the possibility that y1 might be</span> <span m=''117000''>zero.
  If y1 is zero,</span> <span m=''119000''>so, the bad case that must be excluded
  is that y1 equals zero,</span> <span m=''126000''>y2 nonzero. I don''t want to call
  those</span> <span m=''130000''>independent. But nonetheless,</span> <span m=''133000''>it
  is true that y2 is not a constant multiple of y1.</span> </p><p><span m=''136000''>However,
  y1 is a constant multiple of y2,</span> <span m=''139000''>namely, the multiple
  zero. It''s just to exclude that case</span> <span m=''143000''>that I have to say
  both of those things.</span> </p><p><span m=''146000''>And, one would not be sufficed.
  That''s a fine point that I''m</span> <span m=''153000''>not going to fuss over.
  But I just have,</span> <span m=''157000''>of course. Now, why do you do that?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''161000''>That''s because, then, all solutions,</span> <span m=''165000''>and
  this is what concerns us today, are what?</span> </p><p><span m=''170000''>The linear
  combination with constant coefficients of these</span> <span m=''176000''>two, and
  the fundamental question we have to answer today</span> <span m=''182000''>is, why?
  Now, there are really two</span> <span m=''187000''>statements involved in that.
  On the one hand,</span> <span m=''193000''>I''m claiming there is an easier statement,
  which is that they</span> <span m=''200000''>are all solutions. So, that''s question
  one,</span> <span m=''204000''>or statement one. Why are all of these guys</span>
  <span m=''209000''>solutions? That, I could trust you to</span> <span m=''213000''>answer
  yourself. I could not trust you to answer</span> <span m=''217000''>it elegantly.
  And, it''s the elegance that''s</span> <span m=''219000''>the most important thing
  today because you have to answer it</span> <span m=''224000''>elegantly. Otherwise,
  you can''t go on and</span> <span m=''226000''>do more complicated things. If you
  answer it in an ad hoc</span> <span m=''230000''>basis just by hacking out a computation,
  you don''t really</span> <span m=''234000''>see what''s going on. And you can''t
  do more difficult</span> <span m=''238000''>things later. So, we have to answer
  this,</span> <span m=''242000''>and answer it nicely. The second question is,</span>
  <span m=''245000''>so, if that answers why there are solutions at all,</span> <span
  m=''249000''>why are they all the solutions? Why all the solutions?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''254000''>In other words, to say it as badly as possible,</span> <span m=''257000''>why
  are all solutions, why all the solutions-- Never</span> <span m=''261000''>mind.
  Why are all the solutions.</span> </p><p><span m=''264000''>This is a harder question
  to answer, but that should make you</span> <span m=''269000''>happy because that
  means it depends upon a theorem which I''m</span> <span m=''274000''>not going to
  prove. I''ll just quote to you.</span> </p><p><span m=''280000''>Let''s attack there
  for problem one first.</span> </p><p><span m=''287000''>q1 is answered by what''s
  called the superposition.</span> </p><p><span m=''296000''>The superposition principle
  says exactly that.</span> </p><p><span m=''305000''>It says exactly that, that if
  y1 and y2 are solutions</span> <span m=''309000''>to a linear equation, to a linear
  homogeneous ODE,</span> <span m=''312000''>in fact it can be of higher order, too,
  although I won''t</span> <span m=''317000''>stress that. In other words,</span>
  <span m=''319000''>you don''t have to stop with the second derivative.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''323000''>You could add a third derivative and a fourth</span> <span m=''326000''>derivative.
  As long as the former makes the</span> <span m=''330000''>same, but that implies
  automatically that c1 y1 plus c2</span> <span m=''334000''>y2 is a solution. Now,
  the way to do that nicely</span> <span m=''339000''>is to take a little detour and
  talk a little bit about linear</span> <span m=''343000''>operators. And, since we
  are going to be</span> <span m=''346000''>using these for the rest of the term,
  this is the natural place</span> <span m=''351000''>for you to learn a little bit
  about what they are.</span> </p><p><span m=''354000''>So, I''m going to do it. Ultimately,
  I am aimed at a</span> <span m=''358000''>proof of this statement, but there are
  going to be</span> <span m=''362000''>certain side excursions I have to make.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''366000''>The first side side excursion is to write the differential</span>
  <span m=''370000''>equation in a different way. So, I''m going to just write its</span>
  <span m=''375000''>transformations. The first, I''ll simply recopy</span> <span
  m=''379000''>what you know it to be, q y equals zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''382000''>That''s
  the first form. The second form,</span> <span m=''385000''>I''m going to replace
  this by the differentiation operator.</span> </p><p><span m=''391000''>So, I''m
  going to write this as D squared y.</span> </p><p><span m=''395000''>That means
  differentiate it twice.</span> </p><p><span m=''398000''>D it, and then D it again.
  This one I only have to</span> <span m=''402000''>differentiate once, so I''ll write
  that as p D(y),</span> <span m=''406000''>p times the derivative of Y. The last
  one isn''t</span> <span m=''410000''>differentiated at all. I just recopy it.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''413000''>Now, I''m going to formally factor out the y.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''417000''>So this, I''m going to turn into D squared plus pD plus q.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''422000''>Now, everybody reads this as</span> <span m=''427000''>times y equals
  zero. But, what it means is this guy,</span> <span m=''433000''>it means this is
  shorthand for that.</span> </p><p><span m=''436000''>I''m not multiplying. I''m
  multiplying q times y.</span> </p><p><span m=''441000''>But, I''m not multiplying
  D times y.</span> </p><p><span m=''445000''>I''m applying D to y. Nonetheless,</span>
  <span m=''448000''>the notation suggests this is very suggestive of that.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''452000''>And this, in turn, implies that.</span> </p><p><span m=''455000''>I''m
  just transforming it. And now, I''ll take the final</span> <span m=''459000''>step.
  I''m going to view this thing in</span> <span m=''462000''>parentheses as a guy
  all by itself, a linear operator.</span> </p><p><span m=''466000''>This is a linear
  operator, called a linear operator.</span> </p><p><span m=''470000''>And, I''m going
  to simply abbreviate it by the letter L.</span> </p><p><span m=''474000''>And so,
  the final version of this equation has been reduced</span> <span m=''478000''>to
  nothing but Ly equals zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''483000''>Now, what''s L? You
  can think of L as,</span> <span m=''485000''>well, formally, L you would write as
  D squared</span> <span m=''489000''>plus pD plus q. But, you can think of L,</span>
  <span m=''493000''>the way to think of it is as a black box, a function of what</span>
  <span m=''498000''>goes into the black box, well, if this were a function</span>
  <span m=''502000''>box, what would go it would be a number, and what would come
  out</span> <span m=''507000''>with the number. But it''s not that kind of a</span>
  <span m=''511000''>black box. It''s an operator box,</span> <span m=''514000''>and
  therefore, what goes in is a function of</span> <span m=''518000''>x. And, what
  comes out is another</span> <span m=''521000''>function of x, the result of applying
  this</span> <span m=''524000''>operator to that. So, from this point of view,</span>
  <span m=''528000''>differential equations, trying to solve the</span> <span m=''532000''>differential
  equation means, what should come out you want</span> <span m=''537000''>to come
  out zero, and the question is,</span> <span m=''540000''>what should you put in?
  That''s what it means solving</span> <span m=''545000''>differential equations in
  an inverse problem.</span> </p><p><span m=''548000''>The easy thing is to put it
  a function, and see what comes</span> <span m=''551000''>out. You just calculate.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''553000''>The hard thing is to ask, you say, I want such and such
  a</span> <span m=''556000''>thing to come out, for example,</span> <span m=''558000''>zero;
  what should I put in? That''s a difficult question,</span> <span m=''562000''>and
  that''s what we''re spending the term answering.</span> </p><p><span m=''565000''>Now,
  the key thing about this is that this is a linear</span> <span m=''568000''>operator.
  And, what that means is that it</span> <span m=''572000''>behaves in a certain way
  with respect to functions.</span> </p><p><span m=''577000''>The easiest way to say
  it is, I like to make two laws of it,</span> <span m=''582000''>that L of u1, if
  you have two functions,</span> <span m=''585000''>I''m not going to put up the parentheses,
  x,</span> <span m=''589000''>because that just makes things look longer and not
  any clearer,</span> <span m=''595000''>actually. What does L do to the sum of</span>
  <span m=''598000''>two functions? If that''s a linear operator,</span> <span m=''603000''>if
  you put in the sum of two functions, what you must get out</span> <span m=''608000''>is
  the corresponding L''s, the sum of the corresponding</span> <span m=''612000''>L''s
  of each. So, that''s a law.</span> </p><p><span m=''614000''>And, the other law,
  linearity law,</span> <span m=''617000''>and this goes for anything in mathematics
  and its</span> <span m=''621000''>applications, which is called linear,</span> <span
  m=''624000''>basically anything is linear if it does the following thing to</span>
  <span m=''629000''>functions or numbers or whatever.</span> </p><p><span m=''633000''>The
  other one is of a constant times any function,</span> <span m=''637000''>I don''t
  have to give it a number now because I''m only</span> <span m=''641000''>using one
  of them, should be equal to c times L of</span> <span m=''646000''>u. So, here,
  c is a constant,</span> <span m=''648000''>and here, of course, the u is a function,</span>
  <span m=''651000''>functions of x. These are the two laws of</span> <span m=''655000''>linearity.
  An operator is linear if it</span> <span m=''658000''>satisfies these two laws.
  Now, for example,</span> <span m=''663000''>the differentiation operator is such
  an operator.</span> </p><p><span m=''666000''>D is linear, why?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''667000''>Well, because of the very first things you verify after you</span>
  <span m=''671000''>learn what the derivative is because the derivative of,</span>
  <span m=''675000''>well, I will write it in the D form.</span> </p><p><span m=''677000''>I''ll
  write it in the form in which you know it.</span> </p><p><span m=''680000''>It would
  be D apply to u1 plus u2.</span> </p><p><span m=''683000''>How does one write that
  in ordinary calculus?</span> </p><p><span m=''686000''>Well, like that. Or, maybe
  you write d by dx out</span> <span m=''691000''>front. Let''s write it this way,</span>
  <span m=''693000''>is equal to u1 prime plus u2 prime.</span> </p><p><span m=''696000''>That''s
  a law. You prove it when you first</span> <span m=''699000''>study what a derivative
  is. It''s a property.</span> </p><p><span m=''702000''>From our point of view, it''s
  a property of the</span> <span m=''705000''>differentiation operator. It has this
  property.</span> </p><p><span m=''708000''>The D of u1 plus u2 is D of u1 plus D
  of u2.</span> </p><p><span m=''712000''>And, it also has the property</span> <span
  m=''715000''>that c u prime, you can pull out the constant.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''720000''>That''s not affected by the differentiation.</span> </p><p><span m=''723000''>So,
  these two familiar laws from the beginning of calculus</span> <span m=''727000''>say,
  in our language, that D is a linear operator.</span> </p><p><span m=''731000''>What
  about the multiplication of law?</span> </p><p><span m=''734000''>That''s even more
  important, that u1 times u2 prime,</span> <span m=''738000''>I have nothing whatever
  to say about that in here.</span> </p><p><span m=''742000''>In this context, it''s
  an important law,</span> <span m=''745000''>but it''s not important with respect
  to the study of</span> <span m=''749000''>linearity. So, there''s an example.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''753000''>Here''s a more complicated one that I''m claiming is the
  linear</span> <span m=''758000''>operator. And, since I don''t want to have</span>
  <span m=''761000''>to work in this lecture, the work is left to you.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''765000''>So, the proof, prove that L is linear,</span> <span m=''768000''>is
  this particular operator. L is linear.</span> </p><p><span m=''771000''>That''s
  in your part one homework to verify that.</span> </p><p><span m=''775000''>And you
  will do some simple exercises in recitation tomorrow</span> <span m=''779000''>to
  sort of warm you up for that if you haven''t done it already.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''786000''>Well, you shouldn''t have because this only goes with this</span> <span
  m=''793000''>lecture, actually. It''s forbidden to work ahead in</span> <span m=''799000''>this
  class. All right, where are we?</span> </p><p><span m=''803000''>Well, all that
  was a prelude to proving this simple theorem,</span> <span m=''811000''>superposition
  principle. So, finally,</span> <span m=''815000''>what''s the proof? The proof of
  the superposition</span> <span m=''822000''>principle: if you believe that the operator
  is linear,</span> <span m=''830000''>then L of c1, in other words,</span> <span
  m=''833000''>the ODE is L. L is D squared plus pD plus q.</span> </p><p><span m=''839000''>So,
  the ODE is Ly equals zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''844000''>And, what am I being
  asked to</span> <span m=''847000''>prove? I''m being asked to prove that</span>
  <span m=''850000''>if y1 and y2 are solutions, then so is that thing.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''853000''>By the way, that''s called a linear combination.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''856000''>Put that in your notes. Maybe I better write it even on</span> <span
  m=''860000''>the board because it''s something people say all the time without</span>
  <span m=''864000''>realizing they haven''t defined it.</span> </p><p><span m=''866000''>This
  is called a linear combination.</span> </p><p><span m=''870000''>This expression
  is called a linear combination of y1 and y2.</span> </p><p><span m=''875000''>It
  means that particular sum with constant coefficients.</span> </p><p><span m=''880000''>Okay,
  so, the ODE is Ly equals zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''884000''>And, I''m trying
  to prove that fact about it,</span> <span m=''888000''>that if y1 and y2 are solutions,
  so is a linear</span> <span m=''892000''>combination of them. So, the proof,</span>
  <span m=''895000''>then, I start with apply L to c1 y1 plus c2 y2.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''900000''>Now, because this operator is</span> <span m=''905000''>linear, it
  takes the sum of two functions into the corresponding</span> <span m=''910000''>sum
  up what the operator would be.</span> </p><p><span m=''913000''>So, it would be
  L of c1 y1 plus L of c2 y2.</span> </p><p><span m=''917000''>That''s because L is
  a linear</span> <span m=''920000''>operator. But, I don''t have to stop</span> <span
  m=''923000''>there. Because L is a linear operator,</span> <span m=''926000''>I
  can pull the c out front. So, it''s c1 L of y1 plus c2 L</span> <span m=''931000''>of
  y2. Now, where am I?</span> </p><p><span m=''936000''>Trying to prove that this
  is zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''938000''>Well, what is L of y1? At this point,</span>
  <span m=''940000''>I use the fact that y1 is a solution.</span> </p><p><span m=''943000''>Because
  it''s a solution, this is zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''946000''>That''s what it
  means to solve that differential equation.</span> </p><p><span m=''950000''>It means,
  when you apply the linear operator,</span> <span m=''953000''>L, to the function,
  you get zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''955000''>In the same way, y2 is a solution.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''957000''>So, that''s zero. And, the sum of c1 times zero</span>
  <span m=''962000''>plus c2 times zero is zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''965000''>That''s
  the argument. Now, you could make the same</span> <span m=''968000''>argument just
  by plugging c1 y1, plugging it into the equation</span> <span m=''973000''>and calculating,
  and calculating,</span> <span m=''975000''>and calculating, grouping the terms and
  so on</span> <span m=''978000''>and so forth. But, that''s just calculation.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''981000''>It doesn''t show you why it''s so.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''984000''>Why it''s so is because the operator, this differential</span> <span
  m=''988000''>equation is expressed as a linear operator applied to y is</span> <span
  m=''992000''>zero. And, the only properties that</span> <span m=''997000''>are really
  been used as the fact that this operator is linear.</span> </p><p><span m=''1006000''>That''s
  the key point. L is linear.</span> </p><p><span m=''1010000''>It''s a linear operator.
  Well, that''s all there is to</span> <span m=''1017000''>the superposition principle.
  As a prelude to answering the</span> <span m=''1024000''>more difficult question,
  why are these all the</span> <span m=''1027000''>solutions? Why are there no other</span>
  <span m=''1029000''>solutions? We need a few definitions,</span> <span m=''1032000''>and
  a few more ideas. And, they are going to occur in</span> <span m=''1036000''>connection
  with, so I''m now addressing,</span> <span m=''1038000''>ultimately, question two.
  But, it''s not going to be</span> <span m=''1042000''>addressed directly for quite
  awhile.</span> </p><p><span m=''1045000''>Instead, I''m going to phrase it in terms
  of solving the initial</span> <span m=''1049000''>value problem. So far, we''ve
  only talked about</span> <span m=''1054000''>the general solution with those two
  arbitrary constants.</span> </p><p><span m=''1059000''>But, how do you solve the
  initial value problem,</span> <span m=''1063000''>in other words, fit initial conditions,</span>
  <span m=''1066000''>find the solution with given initial values for the function</span>
  <span m=''1071000''>and its derivatives. Now, --</span> <span m=''1084000''>-- the
  theorem is that this collection of functions with</span> <span m=''1088000''>these
  arbitrary constants, these are all the solutions we</span> <span m=''1092000''>have
  so far. In fact, they are all the</span> <span m=''1095000''>solutions there are,
  but we don''t know that yet.</span> </p><p><span m=''1099000''>However, if we just
  focus on the big class of solutions,</span> <span m=''1103000''>there might be others
  lurking out there somewhere lurking out</span> <span m=''1108000''>there. I don''t
  know.</span> </p><p><span m=''1111000''>But let''s use what we have, that just from
  this family is</span> <span m=''1119000''>enough to satisfy any initial condition,
  to satisfy any</span> <span m=''1127000''>initial values. In other words,</span>
  <span m=''1131000''>if you give me any initial values, I will be able to find</span>
  <span m=''1139000''>the c1 and c2 which work. Now, why is that?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1145000''>Well, I''d have to do a song and dance at this point,</span> <span
  m=''1148000''>if you hadn''t been softened up by actually calculating for</span>
  <span m=''1152000''>specific differential equations. You''ve had exercises and</span>
  <span m=''1155000''>actually how to calculate the values of c1 and c2.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1159000''>So, I''m going to do it now in general what you have done so</span>
  <span m=''1163000''>far for particular equations using particular values of the</span>
  <span m=''1166000''>initial conditions. So, I''m relying on that</span> <span m=''1170000''>experience
  that you''ve had in doing the homework to make</span> <span m=''1175000''>intelligible
  what I''m going to do now in the abstract using</span> <span m=''1180000''>just
  letters. So, why is this so?</span> </p><p><span m=''1183000''>Why is that so? Well,
  we are going to need it,</span> <span m=''1187000''>by the way, here, too.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1189000''>I''ll have to, again, open up parentheses.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1192000''>But let''s go as far as we can. Well, you just try to do it.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1197000''>Suppose the initial conditions are, how will we write
  them?</span> </p><p><span m=''1204000''>So, they''re going to be at some initial
  point,</span> <span m=''1206000''>x0. You can take it to be zero if</span> <span
  m=''1208000''>you want, but I''d like to be, just for a little while,</span> <span
  m=''1212000''>a little more general. So, let''s say the initial</span> <span m=''1215000''>conditions,
  the initial values are being given at the point x0,</span> <span m=''1219000''>all
  right, that''s going to be some number.</span> </p><p><span m=''1221000''>Let''s
  just call it a. And, the initial value also has</span> <span m=''1225000''>to specify
  the velocity or the value of the derivative there.</span> </p><p><span m=''1230000''>Let''s
  say these are the initial values.</span> </p><p><span m=''1233000''>So, the problem
  is to find the c which work.</span> </p><p><span m=''1237000''>Now, how do you do
  that? Well, you know from</span> <span m=''1241000''>calculation. You write y equals
  c1 y1 plus</span> <span m=''1245000''>c2 y2. And you write y prime,</span> <span
  m=''1247000''>and you take the derivative underneath that,</span> <span m=''1251000''>which
  is easy to do. And now, you plug in x equals</span> <span m=''1256000''>zero. And,
  what happens?</span> </p><p><span m=''1260000''>Well, these now turn into a set
  of equations.</span> </p><p><span m=''1264000''>What will they look like? Well,
  y of x0 is a,</span> <span m=''1268000''>and this is b. So, what I get is let me
  flop</span> <span m=''1272000''>it over onto the other side because that''s the
  way you''re</span> <span m=''1277000''>used to looking at systems of equations.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1281000''>So, what we get is c1 times y1 of x0 plus c2 times y2
  of x0.</span> </p><p><span m=''1286000''>What''s that supposed to be</span> <span
  m=''1291000''>equal to? Well, that''s supposed to be</span> <span m=''1294000''>equal
  to y of x0. It''s supposed to be equal to</span> <span m=''1297000''>the given number,
  a.</span> </p><p><span m=''1299000''>And, in the same way, c1 y1 prime of x0 plus
  c2 y2</span> <span m=''1302000''>prime of x0, that''s supposed to turn out to</span>
  <span m=''1306000''>be the number, b.</span> </p><p><span m=''1308000''>In the calculations
  you''ve done up to this point,</span> <span m=''1311000''>y1 and y2 were always
  specific functions like e to the x</span> <span m=''1315000''>or cosine of 22x,</span>
  <span m=''1317000''>stuff like that. Now I''m doing it in the</span> <span m=''1321000''>abstract,
  just calling them y1 and y2, so as to include all</span> <span m=''1326000''>those
  possible cases. Now, what am I supposed to do?</span> </p><p><span m=''1330000''>I''m
  supposed to find c1 and c2. What kind of things are they?</span> </p><p><span m=''1335000''>This
  is what you studied in high school, right?</span> </p><p><span m=''1339000''>The
  letters are around us, but it''s a pair of simultaneous</span> <span m=''1343000''>linear
  equations. What are the variables?</span> </p><p><span m=''1346000''>What are the
  variables? What are the variables?</span> </p><p><span m=''1350000''>Somebody raise
  their hand. If you have a pair of</span> <span m=''1355000''>simultaneous linear
  equations, you''ve got variables and you''ve</span> <span m=''1359000''>got constants,
  right?</span> </p><p><span m=''1361000''>And you are trying to find the answer.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1363000''>What are the variables? Yeah?</span> </p><p><span m=''1365000''>c1
  and c2. Very good.</span> </p><p><span m=''1367000''>I mean, it''s extremely confusing
  because in the first</span> <span m=''1370000''>place, how can they be the variables
  if they occur on the</span> <span m=''1374000''>wrong side? They''re on the wrong
  side;</span> <span m=''1377000''>they are constants. How can constants be variables?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1382000''>Everything about this is wrong. Nonetheless,</span> <span
  m=''1386000''>the c1 and the c2 are the unknowns, if you like the high</span> <span
  m=''1390000''>school terminology. c1 and c2 are the unknowns.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1394000''>These messes are just numbers. After you''ve plugged in x0,</span>
  <span m=''1399000''>this is some number. You''ve got four numbers here.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1403000''>So, c1 and c2 are the variables.</span> </p><p><span m=''1406000''>The
  two find, in other words,</span> <span m=''1408000''>to find the values of. All
  right, now you know general</span> <span m=''1414000''>theorems from 18.02 about
  when can you solve such a system of</span> <span m=''1419000''>equations. I''m claiming
  that you can</span> <span m=''1422000''>always find c1 and c2 that work. But, you
  know that''s not always</span> <span m=''1428000''>the case that a pair of simultaneous
  linear equations</span> <span m=''1432000''>can be solved. There''s a condition.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1435000''>There''s a condition which guarantees their solution,</span>
  <span m=''1439000''>which is what? What has to be true about the</span> <span m=''1444000''>coefficients?
  These are the coefficients.</span> </p><p><span m=''1448000''>What has to be true?
  The matrix of coefficients must</span> <span m=''1453000''>be invertible. The determinant
  of coefficients</span> <span m=''1458000''>must be nonzero. So, they are solvable
  if,</span> <span m=''1462000''>for the c1 and c2, if this thing,</span> <span m=''1465000''>I''m
  going to write it. Since all of these are</span> <span m=''1469000''>evaluated at
  x0, I''m going to write it in this</span> <span m=''1474000''>way. y1, the determinant,</span>
  <span m=''1478000''>whose entries are y1, y2, y1 prime,</span> <span m=''1481000''>and
  y2 prime,</span> <span m=''1484000''>evaluated at zero, x0, that means that I evaluate</span>
  <span m=''1489000''>each of the functions in the determinant at x0.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1494000''>I''ll write it this way. That should be not zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1500000''>So, in other words, the key thing which makes this</span> <span m=''1503000''>possible,
  makes it possible for us to solve the initial value</span> <span m=''1508000''>problem,
  is that this funny determinant should not be zero</span> <span m=''1513000''>at
  the point at which we are interested.</span> </p><p><span m=''1516000''>Now, this
  determinant is important in 18.03.</span> </p><p><span m=''1519000''>It has a name,
  and this is when you''re going</span> <span m=''1523000''>to learn it, if you don''t
  know it already.</span> </p><p><span m=''1526000''>That determinant is called the
  Wronskian.</span> </p><p><span m=''1531000''>The Wronskian of what? If you want
  to be pompous,</span> <span m=''1534000''>you say this with a V sound instead of
  a W.</span> </p><p><span m=''1537000''>But, nobody does except people trying to
  be pompous.</span> </p><p><span m=''1541000''>The Wronskian, we''ll write a W.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1543000''>Now, notice, you can only calculate it when</span> <span
  m=''1547000''>you know what the two functions are.</span> </p><p><span m=''1549000''>So,
  the Wronskian of the two functions, y1 and y2,</span> <span m=''1553000''>what''s
  the variable? It''s not a function of two</span> <span m=''1556000''>variables,
  y1 and y2. These are just the names of</span> <span m=''1560000''>functions of x.
  So, when you do it,</span> <span m=''1564000''>put it in, calculate out that determinant.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1568000''>This is a function of x, a function of the independent</span>
  <span m=''1573000''>variable after you''ve done the calculation.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1577000''>Anyway, let''s write its definition, y1,</span> <span m=''1580000''>y2,
  y1 prime, y2 prime.</span> </p><p><span m=''1583000''>Now, in order to do this,</span>
  <span m=''1586000''>the point is we must know that that Wronskian is not zero,</span>
  <span m=''1592000''>that the Wronskian of these two functions is not zero at the</span>
  <span m=''1597000''>point x0. Now, enter a theorem which</span> <span m=''1602000''>you''re
  going to prove for homework, but this is harder.</span> </p><p><span m=''1607000''>So,
  it''s part two homework. It''s not part one homework.</span> </p><p><span m=''1611000''>In
  other words, I didn''t give you the answer.</span> </p><p><span m=''1615000''>You''ve
  got to find it yourself, alone or in the company of good</span> <span m=''1621000''>friends.
  So, anyway, here''s the</span> <span m=''1625000''>Wronskian. Now, what can we say
  for sure?</span> </p><p><span m=''1628000''>Note, suppose y1 and y, just to get
  you a feeling for</span> <span m=''1633000''>it a little bit, suppose they were
  not</span> <span m=''1636000''>independent. The word for not independent is</span>
  <span m=''1640000''>dependent. Suppose they were dependent.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1644000''>In other words, suppose that y2 were a constant</span> <span m=''1648000''>multiple
  of y1. We know that''s not the case</span> <span m=''1653000''>because our functions
  are supposed to be independent.</span> </p><p><span m=''1657000''>But suppose they
  weren''t. What would the value of the</span> <span m=''1662000''>Wronskian be? If
  y2 is a constant times y1,</span> <span m=''1666000''>then y2 prime is that same
  constant times y1 prime.</span> </p><p><span m=''1670000''>What''s the value of
  the determinant?</span> </p><p><span m=''1673000''>Zero. For what values of x is
  it zero</span> <span m=''1676000''>for all values of x? And now, that''s the theorem</span>
  <span m=''1681000''>that you''re going to prove, that if y1 and y2 are solutions</span>
  <span m=''1686000''>to the ODE, I won''t keep, say, it''s the ODE we''ve been</span>
  <span m=''1690000''>talking about, y double prime plus py.</span> </p><p><span m=''1694000''>But
  the linear homogeneous with</span> <span m=''1700000''>not constant coefficients,
  just linear homogeneous second</span> <span m=''1706000''>order. Our solutions,</span>
  <span m=''1709000''>as there are only two possibilities,</span> <span m=''1713000''>either-or.
  Either the Wronskian of y,</span> <span m=''1717000''>there are only two possibilities.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1719000''>Either the Wronskian of y1 and y2 is always zero,</span>
  <span m=''1724000''>identically zero, zero for all values of x.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1727000''>This is redundant. When I say identically,</span> <span m=''1731000''>I
  mean for all values of x. But, I am just making assurance</span> <span m=''1736000''>doubly
  sure. Or, or the Wronskian is never</span> <span m=''1741000''>zero. Now, there
  is no notation as</span> <span m=''1746000''>for that. I''d better just write it
  out,</span> <span m=''1750000''>is never zero, i.e.</span> </p><p><span m=''1753000''>for
  no x is it, i.e.</span> </p><p><span m=''1755000''>for all x. There''s no way to
  say that.</span> </p><p><span m=''1760000''>I mean, for all values of x, it''s not
  zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''1766000''>That means, there is not a single point
  for which it''s</span> <span m=''1772000''>zero. In particular,</span> <span m=''1775000''>it''s
  not zero here. So, this is your homework:</span> <span m=''1783000''>problem five,
  part two.</span> </p><p><span m=''1785000''>I''ll give you a method of proving it,
  which was discovered</span> <span m=''1792000''>by the famous Norwegian mathematician,</span>
  <span m=''1797000''>Abel, who is, I guess, the centenary of his</span> <span m=''1802000''>birth,
  I guess, was just celebrated last year.</span> </p><p><span m=''1809000''>He has
  one of the truly tragic stories in mathematics,</span> <span m=''1813000''>which
  I think you can read. It must be a Simmons book,</span> <span m=''1818000''>if you
  have that. Simmons is very good on</span> <span m=''1822000''>biographies. Look
  up Abel.</span> </p><p><span m=''1824000''>He''ll have a biography of Abel, and
  you can weep if you''re</span> <span m=''1829000''>feeling sad. He died at the age
  of 26 of</span> <span m=''1834000''>tuberculosis, having done a number of</span>
  <span m=''1837000''>sensational things, none of which was recognized in</span> <span
  m=''1841000''>his lifetime because people buried his papers under big</span> <span
  m=''1846000''>piles of papers. So, he died unknown,</span> <span m=''1849000''>uncelebrated,
  and now he''s Norway''s greatest</span> <span m=''1853000''>culture hero. In the
  middle of a park in</span> <span m=''1856000''>Oslo, there''s a huge statue. And,
  since nobody knows what</span> <span m=''1863000''>Abel looked like, the statue
  is way up high so</span> <span m=''1867000''>you can''t see very well. But, the
  inscription on the</span> <span m=''1873000''>bottom says Niels Henrik Abel, 1801-1826
  or something like</span> <span m=''1879000''>that. Now, --</span> <span m=''1898000''>--
  the choice, I''m still, believe it or not,</span> <span m=''1901000''>aiming at
  question two, but I have another big</span> <span m=''1904000''>parentheses to open.
  And, when I closed it,</span> <span m=''1907000''>the answer to question two will
  be simple.</span> </p><p><span m=''1910000''>But, I think it''s very desirable that
  you get this</span> <span m=''1913000''>second big parentheses. It will help you
  to understand</span> <span m=''1917000''>something important. It will help you on
  your</span> <span m=''1922000''>problem set tomorrow night. I don''t have to apologize.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1928000''>I''m just going to do it. So, the question is,</span>
  <span m=''1932000''>the thing you have to understand is that when I write</span>
  <span m=''1938000''>this combination, I''m claiming that these are all</span> <span
  m=''1943000''>the solutions. I haven''t proved that yet.</span> </p><p><span m=''1947000''>But,
  they are going to be all the solutions</span> <span m=''1953000''>The point is,
  there''s nothing sacrosanct</span> <span m=''1956000''>about the y1 and y2. This
  is exactly the same</span> <span m=''1961000''>collection as a collection which
  I would write using other</span> <span m=''1966000''>constants. Let''s call them
  u1 and u2.</span> </p><p><span m=''1969000''>They are exactly the same, where u1
  and u2 are any other</span> <span m=''1975000''>pair of linearly independent solutions.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1980000''>Any other pair of independent solutions, they must be</span>
  <span m=''1985000''>independent, either a constant multiple of each other.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1990000''>In other words, u1 is some combination,</span> <span
  m=''1993000''>now I''m really stuck because I don''t know how to,</span> <span m=''1998000''>c1
  bar, let''s say, that means a special value of</span> <span m=''2002000''>c1, and
  a special value of c2, and u2 is some other special</span> <span m=''2008000''>value,
  oh my God, c1 double bar,</span> <span m=''2011000''>how''s that? The notation is
  getting worse</span> <span m=''2016000''>and worse. I apologize for it.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2018000''>In other words, I could pick y1 and y2 and make</span> <span m=''2022000''>up
  all of these. And, I''d get a bunch of</span> <span m=''2025000''>solutions. But,
  I could also pick some</span> <span m=''2028000''>other family, some other two guys
  in this</span> <span m=''2031000''>family, and just as well express the solutions
  in terms of u1 and</span> <span m=''2036000''>u2. Now, well, why is he telling us</span>
  <span m=''2039000''>that? Well, the point is that the y1</span> <span m=''2043000''>and
  the y2 are typically the ones you get easily from solving</span> <span m=''2048000''>the
  equations, like e to the x and e</span> <span m=''2051000''>to the 2x. That''s what
  you''ve gotten,</span> <span m=''2055000''>or cosine x and sine x,</span> <span
  m=''2058000''>something like that. But, for certain ways,</span> <span m=''2062000''>they
  might not be the best way of writing the solutions.</span> </p><p><span m=''2066000''>There
  is another way of writing those that you should learn,</span> <span m=''2071000''>and
  that''s called finding normalized, the normalized.</span> </p><p><span m=''2075000''>They
  are okay, but they are not normalized.</span> </p><p><span m=''2080000''>For some
  things, the normalized solutions are</span> <span m=''2082000''>the best. I''ll
  explain to you what they</span> <span m=''2084000''>are, and I''ll explain to you
  what they''re good for.</span> </p><p><span m=''2088000''>You''ll see immediately
  what they''re good for.</span> </p><p><span m=''2090000''>Normalized solutions,
  now, you have to specify the</span> <span m=''2093000''>point at which you''re normalizing.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2095000''>In general, it would be x nought,</span> <span m=''2098000''>but
  let''s, at this point, since I don''t have an infinity</span> <span m=''2101000''>of
  time, to simplify things, let''s say zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''2105000''>It
  could be x nought, any point would do just as</span> <span m=''2108000''>well. But,
  zero is the most common</span> <span m=''2111000''>choice. What are the normalized</span>
  <span m=''2113000''>solutions? Well, first of all,</span> <span m=''2115000''>I
  have to give them names. I want to still call them y.</span> </p><p><span m=''2119000''>So,
  I''ll call them capital Y1 and Y2.</span> </p><p><span m=''2121000''>And, what they
  are, are the solutions which satisfy</span> <span m=''2125000''>certain, special,
  very special,</span> <span m=''2127000''>initial conditions. And, what are those?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2131000''>So, they''re the ones which satisfy, the initial conditions</span>
  <span m=''2137000''>for Y1 are, of course there are going to be guys that look like</span>
  <span m=''2143000''>this. The only thing that''s going to</span> <span m=''2146000''>make
  them distinctive is the initial conditions they satisfy.</span> </p><p><span m=''2151000''>Y1
  has to satisfy at zero. Its value should be one,</span> <span m=''2156000''>and
  the value of its derivative should be zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''2162000''>For
  Y2, it''s just the opposite. Here, the value of the function</span> <span m=''2167000''>should
  be zero at zero. But, the value of its</span> <span m=''2171000''>derivative, now,
  I want to be one.</span> </p><p><span m=''2174000''>Let me give you a trivial example
  of this,</span> <span m=''2177000''>and then one, which is a little less trivial,</span>
  <span m=''2181000''>so you''ll have some feeling for what I''m asking for.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2185000''>Suppose the equation, for example,</span> <span m=''2188000''>is
  y double prime plus, well, let''s really make it</span> <span m=''2193000''>simple.
  Okay, you know the standard</span> <span m=''2196000''>solutions are y1 is cosine
  x,</span> <span m=''2199000''>and y2 is sine x.</span> </p><p><span m=''2201000''>These
  are functions, which, when you take the second</span> <span m=''2204000''>derivative,
  they turn into their negative.</span> </p><p><span m=''2206000''>You know, you could
  go the complex roots are i and minus i,</span> <span m=''2210000''>and blah, blah,
  blah, blah, blah,</span> <span m=''2212000''>blah. If you do it that way,</span>
  <span m=''2213000''>fine. But at some point in the course</span> <span m=''2216000''>you
  have to be able to write down and, right away,</span> <span m=''2219000''>oh, yeah,
  cosine x, sine x.</span> </p><p><span m=''2221000''>Okay, what are the normalized</span>
  <span m=''2225000''>things? Well, what''s the value of this</span> <span m=''2229000''>at
  zero? It is one.</span> </p><p><span m=''2231000''>What''s the value of its derivative
  at zero?</span> </p><p><span m=''2235000''>Zero. This is Y1.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2236000''>This is the only case in which you locked on immediately to the</span>
  <span m=''2242000''>normalized solutions. In the same way,</span> <span m=''2246000''>this
  guy is Y2 because its value at zero is zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''2252000''>It''s
  value of its derivative at zero is one.</span> </p><p><span m=''2255000''>So, this
  is Y2. Okay, now let''s look at a case</span> <span m=''2259000''>where you don''t
  immediately lock on to the normalized solutions.</span> </p><p><span m=''2264000''>Very
  simple: all I have to do is change the</span> <span m=''2267000''>sign. Here, you
  know,</span> <span m=''2269000''>think through r squared minus one equals zero.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2274000''>The characteristic roots are plus one and minus one,</span>
  <span m=''2278000''>right? And therefore,</span> <span m=''2280000''>the solution
  is e to the x, and e to the negative x.</span> </p><p><span m=''2284000''>So, the
  solutions you find by</span> <span m=''2287000''>the usual way of solving it is
  y1 equals e to the x,</span> <span m=''2291000''>and y2 equals e to the negative
  x.</span> </p><p><span m=''2295000''>Those are the standard solution.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2297000''>So, the general solution is of the form.</span> </p><p><span m=''2299000''>So,
  the general solution is of the form c1 e to the x plus c2 e</span> <span m=''2303000''>to
  the negative x.</span> </p><p><span m=''2306000''>Now, what I want to find out is
  what is Y1 and Y2?</span> </p><p><span m=''2311000''>How do I find out what Y1 is?
  Well, I have to satisfy initial</span> <span m=''2316000''>conditions. So, if this
  is y,</span> <span m=''2318000''>let''s write down here, if you can still see that,</span>
  <span m=''2323000''>y prime is c1 e to the x minus c2 e to the negative x .</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2328000''>So, if I plug in,</span> <span m=''2331000''>I want y
  of zero to be one, I want this guy at the point</span> <span m=''2336000''>zero
  to be one. What equation does that give</span> <span m=''2340000''>me? That gives
  me c1 plus c2,</span> <span m=''2344000''>c1 plus c2, plugging in x equals zero,</span>
  <span m=''2348000''>equals the value of this thing at zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2351000''>So, that''s supposed to be one.</span> </p><p><span m=''2354000''>How
  about the other guy? The value of its derivative is</span> <span m=''2359000''>supposed
  to come out to be zero. And, what is its derivative?</span> </p><p><span m=''2364000''>Well,
  plug into this expression.</span> </p><p><span m=''2366000''>It''s c1 minus c2.
  Okay, what''s the solution to</span> <span m=''2372000''>those pair of equations?
  c2 has to be equal to c1.</span> </p><p><span m=''2376000''>The sum of the two of
  them has to be one.</span> </p><p><span m=''2379000''>Each one, therefore, is equal
  to one half.</span> </p><p><span m=''2382000''>And so, what''s the value of Y1?
  Y1, therefore,</span> <span m=''2386000''>is the function where c1 and c2 are one
  half.</span> </p><p><span m=''2390000''>It''s the function e to the x plus e to
  the negative x divided</span> <span m=''2395000''>by two.</span> </p><p><span m=''2399000''>In
  the same way, I won''t repeat the calculation.</span> </p><p><span m=''2403000''>You
  can do yourself. Same calculation shows that Y2,</span> <span m=''2407000''>so,
  put in the initial conditions.</span> </p><p><span m=''2410000''>The answer will
  be that Y2 is equal to e to the x minus e to</span> <span m=''2415000''>the minus
  x divided by two.</span> </p><p><span m=''2419000''>These are the special functions.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2422000''>For this equation, these are the normalized</span> <span
  m=''2425000''>solutions. They are better than the</span> <span m=''2428000''>original
  solutions because their initial values are nicer.</span> </p><p><span m=''2435000''>Just
  check it. The initial value,</span> <span m=''2437000''>when x is equal to zero,
  the initial value,</span> <span m=''2440000''>this has is zero. Here, when x is
  equal to zero,</span> <span m=''2444000''>the value of the function is zero.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2447000''>But, the value of its derivative, these cancel,</span>
  <span m=''2451000''>is one. So, these are the good guys.</span> </p><p><span m=''2454000''>Okay,
  there''s no colored chalk this period.</span> </p><p><span m=''2457000''>Okay, there
  was colored chalk. There''s one.</span> </p><p><span m=''2461000''>So, for this
  equation, these are the good guys.</span> </p><p><span m=''2464000''>These are our
  best solutions. e to the x and e to the</span> <span m=''2467000''>minus x are good
  solutions.</span> </p><p><span m=''2470000''>But, these are our better solutions.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2472000''>And, this one, of course, is the function</span> <span
  m=''2474000''>which is called hyperbolic sine of x, and this is the one which</span>
  <span m=''2478000''>is called hyperbolic cosine of x.</span> </p><p><span m=''2480000''>This
  is one of the most important ways in which they</span> <span m=''2483000''>enter
  into mathematics. And, this is why the engineers</span> <span m=''2486000''>want
  them. Now, why do the engineers want</span> <span m=''2488000''>normalized solutions?
  Well, I didn''t explain that.</span> </p><p><span m=''2494000''>So, what''s so good
  about normalized solutions?</span> </p><p><span m=''2501000''>Very simple: if Y1
  and Y2 are normalized at</span> <span m=''2507000''>zero, let''s say, then the solution
  to the IVP,</span> <span m=''2513000''>in other words, the ODE plus the initial</span>
  <span m=''2519000''>values, y of zero equals, let''s say, a and y</span> <span m=''2527000''>prime
  of zero equals b.</span> </p><p><span m=''2534000''>So, the ODE I''m not repeating.
  It''s the one we''ve been talking</span> <span m=''2537000''>about all term since
  the beginning of the period.</span> </p><p><span m=''2540000''>It''s the one with
  the p of x and q of x.</span> </p><p><span m=''2543000''>And, here are the initial
  values.</span> </p><p><span m=''2545000''>I''m going to call them a and b. You can
  also call them,</span> <span m=''2548000''>if you like, maybe that''s better to
  call</span> <span m=''2550000''>them y0, as they are individual in the homework.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2554000''>They are called, I''m using the,</span> <span m=''2556000''>let''s
  use those. What is the solution?</span> </p><p><span m=''2559000''>I say the solution
  is, if you use y1 and y2,</span> <span m=''2563000''>the solution is y0, in other
  words,</span> <span m=''2566000''>the a times Y1, plus y0 prime,</span> <span m=''2569000''>in
  other words, b times Y2.</span> </p><p><span m=''2573000''>In other words, you can
  write down instantly</span> <span m=''2577000''>the solution to the initial value
  problem,</span> <span m=''2580000''>if instead of using the functions, you started
  out with</span> <span m=''2585000''>the little Y1 and Y2, you use these better functions.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2592000''>The thing that''s better about them is that they instantly</span>
  <span m=''2596000''>solve for you the initial value problem.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2598000''>All you do is use this number, initial condition as the</span> <span
  m=''2602000''>coefficient of Y1, and use this number as the</span> <span m=''2606000''>coefficient
  of Y2. Now, just check that by looking</span> <span m=''2609000''>at it. Why is
  that so?</span> </p><p><span m=''2612000''>Well, for example, let''s check.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2614000''>What is its value of this function at zero?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2617000''>Well, the value of this guy at zero is one.</span> </p><p><span m=''2620000''>So,
  the answer is y0 times one, and the value of this guy at</span> <span m=''2624000''>zero
  is zero. So, this term disappears.</span> </p><p><span m=''2627000''>And, it''s
  exactly the same with the derivative.</span> </p><p><span m=''2630000''>What''s
  the value of the derivative at zero?</span> </p><p><span m=''2634000''>The value
  of the derivative of this thing is zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''2637000''>So, this
  term disappears. The value of this derivative at</span> <span m=''2641000''>zero
  is one. And so, the answer is y0 prime.</span> </p><p><span m=''2646000''>So, check,
  check,</span> <span m=''2648000''>this works. So, these better solutions have</span>
  <span m=''2651000''>the property, what''s good about them,</span> <span m=''2654000''>and
  why scientists and engineers like them,</span> <span m=''2658000''>is that they
  enable you immediately to write down the</span> <span m=''2662000''>answer to the
  initial value problem without having to go</span> <span m=''2666000''>through this
  business, which I buried down here,</span> <span m=''2670000''>of solving simultaneous
  linear equations.</span> </p><p><span m=''2675000''>Okay, now, believe it or not,
  that''s all the work.</span> </p><p><span m=''2680000''>We are ready to answer question
  number two: why are these all</span> <span m=''2686000''>the solutions? Of course,
  I have to invoke a</span> <span m=''2690000''>big theorem. A big theorem:</span>
  <span m=''2693000''>where shall I invoke a big theorem?</span> </p><p><span m=''2696000''>Let''s
  see if we can do it here. The big theorem says,</span> <span m=''2702000''>it''s
  called the existence and uniqueness theorem.</span> </p><p><span m=''2705000''>It''s
  the last thing that''s proved at the end of an analysis</span> <span m=''2708000''>course,
  at which real analysis courses, over which students</span> <span m=''2711000''>sweat
  for one whole semester, and their reward at the end is,</span> <span m=''2715000''>if
  they are very lucky, and if they have been very good</span> <span m=''2718000''>students,
  they get to see the proof of the existence and</span> <span m=''2721000''>uniqueness
  theorem for differential equations.</span> </p><p><span m=''2724000''>But, I can
  at least say what it is for the linear equation</span> <span m=''2727000''>because
  it''s so simple. It says, so,</span> <span m=''2731000''>the equation we are talking
  about is the usual one,</span> <span m=''2735000''>homogeneous equation, and I''m
  going to assume,</span> <span m=''2739000''>you have to have assumptions that p
  and q are continuous for</span> <span m=''2744000''>all x. So, they''re good-looking</span>
  <span m=''2746000''>functions. Coefficients aren''t allowed to</span> <span m=''2750000''>blow
  up anywhere. They''ve got to look nice.</span> </p><p><span m=''2755000''>Then,
  the theorem says there is one and only one solution,</span> <span m=''2763000''>one
  and only solution satisfying, given initial values</span> <span m=''2771000''>such
  that y of zero, let''s say y of zero is equal to</span> <span m=''2779000''>some
  given number, A,</span> <span m=''2784000''>and y, let''s make y0, and y prime of
  zero equals B.</span> </p><p><span m=''2791000''>The initial value problem has</span>
  <span m=''2797000''>one and only one solution. The existence is,</span> <span m=''2802000''>it
  has a solution. The uniqueness is,</span> <span m=''2805000''>it only has one solution.
  If you specify the initial</span> <span m=''2811000''>conditions, there''s only
  one function which satisfies them</span> <span m=''2816000''>and at the same time
  satisfies that differential equation.</span> </p><p><span m=''2822000''>Now, this
  answers our question. This answers our question,</span> <span m=''2828000''>because,
  look, what I want is all solutions.</span> </p><p><span m=''2834000''>What we want
  are all solutions to the ODE.</span> </p><p><span m=''2841000''>And now, here''s
  what I say: a claim that this collection of</span> <span m=''2853000''>functions,
  c1 Y1 plus c2 Y2 are all</span> <span m=''2862000''>solutions. Of course, I began
  a period by</span> <span m=''2868000''>saying I''d show you that c1 little y1 c
  little y2 are all</span> <span m=''2872000''>the solutions. But, it''s the case
  that these</span> <span m=''2875000''>two families are the same. So, the family
  that I started</span> <span m=''2880000''>with would be exactly the same as the
  family c1 prime Y1</span> <span m=''2884000''>because, after all, these are two</span>
  <span m=''2887000''>special guys from that collection.</span> </p><p><span m=''2891000''>So,
  it doesn''t matter whether I talk about the original ones,</span> <span m=''2895000''>or
  these. The theorem is still the same.</span> </p><p><span m=''2899000''>The final
  step, therefore, if you give me one</span> <span m=''2902000''>more minute, I think
  that will be quite enough.</span> </p><p><span m=''2906000''>Why are these all the
  solutions?</span> </p><p><span m=''2910000''>Well, I have to take an arbitrary solution
  and show you</span> <span m=''2915000''>that it''s one of these. So, the proof is,</span>
  <span m=''2919000''>given a solution, u(x), what are its values?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2923000''>Well, u of x zero is u zero,</span> <span m=''2928000''>and u prime
  of x zero, zero,</span> <span m=''2931000''>let''s say, is equal to u zero, is equal
  to some other</span> <span m=''2938000''>number. Now, what''s the solution?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2942000''>Write down what''s the solution of these using the Y1''s?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2947000''>Then, I know I''ve just shown you that u zero times Y1
  plus u</span> <span m=''2952000''>zero prime Y2 satisfies the same initial</span>
  <span m=''2957000''>conditions, satisfies these initial conditions,</span> <span
  m=''2961000''>initial values. In other words,</span> <span m=''2964000''>I started
  with my little solution.</span> </p><p><span m=''2967000''>u of x walks up to and
  says, hi there.</span> </p><p><span m=''2971000''>Hi there, and the differential
  equation looks at it and says,</span> <span m=''2977000''>who are you? You say,
  oh,</span> <span m=''2981000''>I satisfy you and my initial, and then it says what
  are your</span> <span m=''2986000''>initial values? It says, my initial values are</span>

  which does that. And therefore,</span> <span m=''3013000''>you must be equal to
