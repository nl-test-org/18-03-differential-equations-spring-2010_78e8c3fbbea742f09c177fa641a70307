title: 'Lecture 4: First-order Substitution Methods'
transcript: "<p><span m='4000'>The topic for today is how to change variables.</span>\
  \ <span m='8000'>So, we're talking about substitutions and differential</span> <span\
  \ m='13000'>equations, or changing variables.</span> <span m='16000'>That might\
  \ seem like a sort of fussy thing to talk about in the</span> <span m='22000'>third\
  \ or fourth lecture, but the reason is that so far,</span> <span m='27000'>you know\
  \ how to solve two kinds of differential equations,</span> <span m='32000'>two kinds\
  \ of first-order differential equations,</span> <span m='36000'>one where you can\
  \ separate variables, and the linear</span> <span m='41000'>equation that we talked\
  \ about last time.</span> <span m='47000'>Now, the sad fact is that in some sense,\
  \ those are the only</span> <span m='51000'>two general methods there are, that\
  \ those are the only two</span> <span m='56000'>kinds of equations that can always\
  \ be solved.</span> <span m='60000'>Well, what about all the others?</span> <span\
  \ m='62000'>The answer is that to a great extent, all the other equations</span>\
  \ <span m='66000'>that can be solved, the solution can be done by</span> <span m='69000'>changing\
  \ the variables in the equation to reduce it to one of</span> <span m='74000'>the\
  \ cases that we can already do.</span> <span m='76000'>Now, I'm going to give you\
  \ two examples of that,</span> <span m='79000'>two significant examples of that\
  \ today.</span> <span m='82000'>But, ultimately, as you will see,</span> <span m='84000'>the\
  \ way the equations are solved is by changing them into</span> <span m='88000'>a\
  \ linear equation, or an equation where the</span> <span m='91000'>variables are\
  \ separable. However, that's for a few</span> <span m='96000'>minutes. The first\
  \ change of variables</span> <span m='99000'>that I want to talk about is an almost\
  \ trivial one.</span> <span m='103000'>But it's the most common kind there is, and\
  \ you've already had</span> <span m='107000'>it in physics class. But I think it's\
  \ so important</span> <span m='111000'>in the science and engineering subjects that\
  \ it's a good idea,</span> <span m='115000'>even in 18.03, to call attention to\
  \ it</span> <span m='118000'>explicitly. So, in that sense,</span> <span m='121000'>the\
  \ most common change of variables is the one simple one</span> <span m='126000'>called\
  \ scaling. So, again, the kind of equation</span> <span m='131000'>I'm talking about\
  \ is a general first-order equation.</span> <span m='135000'>And, scaling simply\
  \ means to change the coordinates,</span> <span m='140000'>in effect, or axes, to\
  \ change the coordinates on</span> <span m='144000'>the axes to scale the axes,\
  \ to either stretch them or</span> <span m='149000'>contract them. So, what does\
  \ the change of</span> <span m='154000'>variable actually look like? Well, it means\
  \ you introduce</span> <span m='159000'>new variables, where x1 is equal to x times</span>\
  \ <span m='162000'>something or times a constant. I'll write it as divided by a</span>\
  \ <span m='168000'>constant, since that tends to be a little bit more the way people</span>\
  \ <span m='173000'>think of it. And y, the same.</span> <span m='176000'>So, the\
  \ new variable y1 is related to the old one by an</span> <span m='180000'>equation\
  \ of that form. So, a, b are constants.</span> <span m='186000'>So, those are the\
  \ equations. Why does one do this?</span> <span m='192000'>Well, for a lot of reasons.\
  \ But, maybe we can list them.</span> <span m='199000'>You, for example, could be\
  \ changing units.</span> <span m='204000'>That's a common reason in physics.</span>\
  \ <span m='208000'>Changing the units that he used, you would have to make a</span>\
  \ <span m='215000'>change of coordinates of this form.</span> <span m='221000'>Perhaps\
  \ the even more important reason is to,</span> <span m='225000'>sometimes it's used\
  \ to make the variables dimensionless.</span> <span m='230000'>In other words, so\
  \ that the variables become</span> <span m='235000'>pure numbers, with no units\
  \ attached to them.</span> <span m='239000'>Since you are well aware of the tortures\
  \ involved in dealing</span> <span m='245000'>with units in physics, the point of\
  \ making variables,</span> <span m='250000'>I'm sorry, dimensionless, I don't have\
  \ to sell that.</span> <span m='257000'>Dimensionless, i.e.</span> <span m='258000'>no\
  \ units, without any units attached.</span> <span m='261000'>It just represents\
  \ the number three, not three seconds,</span> <span m='266000'>or three grahams,\
  \ or anything like that.</span> <span m='270000'>And, the third reason is to reduce\
  \ or simplify the</span> <span m='274000'>constants: reduce the number or simplify\
  \ the constants in the</span> <span m='280000'>equation. Reduce their number is\
  \ self</span> <span m='284000'>explanatory. Simplify means make them less,</span>\
  \ <span m='288000'>either dimensionless also, or if you can't do that,</span> <span\
  \ m='293000'>at least less dependent upon the critical units than the old</span>\
  \ <span m='299000'>ones were. Let me give you a very simple</span> <span m='304000'>example\
  \ which will illustrate most of these things.</span> <span m='308000'>It's the equation.\
  \ It's a version of the cooling</span> <span m='312000'>law, which applies at very\
  \ high temperatures,</span> <span m='316000'>and it runs. So, it's like Newton's\
  \ cooling</span> <span m='320000'>laws, except it's the internal and external temperatures\
  \ vary,</span> <span m='325000'>what's important is not the first power as in Newton's\
  \ Law,</span> <span m='330000'>but the fourth power. So, it's a constant.</span>\
  \ <span m='334000'>And, the difference is, now, it's the external</span> <span m='338000'>temperature,\
  \ which, just so there won't be so many</span> <span m='342000'>capital T's in the\
  \ equation, I'm going to call M,</span> <span m='346000'>to the forth power minus\
  \ T to the forth power.</span> <span m='350000'>So, T is the internal</span> <span\
  \ m='353000'>temperature, the thing we are interested in.</span> <span m='357000'>And,\
  \ M is the external constant, which I'll assume,</span> <span m='361000'>now, is\
  \ a constant external temperature.</span> <span m='366000'>So, this is valid if\
  \ big temperature differences,</span> <span m='370000'>Newton's Law, breaks down\
  \ and one needs a</span> <span m='374000'>different one. Now, you are free to solve\
  \ that</span> <span m='379000'>equation just as it stands, if you can.</span> <span\
  \ m='383000'>There are difficulties connected with it because you're</span> <span\
  \ m='388000'>dealing with the fourth powers, of course.</span> <span m='394000'>But,\
  \ before you do that, one should scale.</span> <span m='397000'>How should I scale?\
  \ Well, I'm going to scale by</span> <span m='402000'>relating T to M. So, that\
  \ is very likely to use</span> <span m='406000'>is T1 equals T divided by M.</span>\
  \ <span m='410000'>This is now dimensionless because M, of course,</span> <span\
  \ m='415000'>has the units of temperature, degrees Celsius,</span> <span m='419000'>degrees\
  \ absolute, whatever it is,</span> <span m='422000'>as does T. And therefore,</span>\
  \ <span m='426000'>by taking the ratio of the two, there are no units attached to</span>\
  \ <span m='431000'>it. So, this is dimensionless.</span> <span m='434000'>Now, how\
  \ actually do I change the variable in the equation?</span> <span m='439000'>Well,\
  \ watch this. It's an utterly trivial idea,</span> <span m='443000'>and utterly\
  \ important. Don't slog around doing it this</span> <span m='447000'>way, trying\
  \ to stuff it in, and divide first.</span> <span m='451000'>Instead, do the inverse.\
  \ In other words,</span> <span m='456000'>write it instead as T equals MT1, the\
  \ reason being that it's</span> <span m='461000'>T that's facing you in that equation,\
  \ and therefore T you</span> <span m='466000'>want to substitute for. So, let's\
  \ do it.</span> <span m='469000'>The new equation will be what? Well, dT-- Since\
  \ this is a</span> <span m='474000'>constant, the left-hand side becomes dT1 / dt\
  \ times M equals</span> <span m='479000'>k times M to the forth minus M to the forth\
  \ T1 to the forth,</span> <span m='484000'>so I'm going to factor</span> <span m='489000'>out\
  \ that M to the forth, and make it one minus T1 to the</span> <span m='494000'>forth,\
  \ okay?</span> <span m='498000'>Now, I could divide through by M and get rid of\
  \ one of those,</span> <span m='503000'>and so, the new equation, now, is dT1 /\
  \ dt,</span> <span m='507000'>d time, is equal to-- Now, I have k M cubed out</span>\
  \ <span m='512000'>front here. I'm going to just give that a</span> <span m='516000'>new\
  \ name, k1. Essentially,</span> <span m='519000'>it's the same equation. It's no\
  \ harder to solve and no</span> <span m='524000'>easier to solve than the original\
  \ one.</span> <span m='527000'>But it's been simplified. For one, I think it looks</span>\
  \ <span m='532000'>better. So, to compare the two,</span> <span m='535000'>I'll\
  \ put this one up in green, and this one in green,</span> <span m='540000'>too,\
  \ just to convince you it's the same, but indicate that it's</span> <span m='546000'>the\
  \ same equation. Notice, so, T1 has been</span> <span m='551000'>rendered, is now\
  \ dimensionless. So, I don't have to even ask</span> <span m='556000'>when I solve\
  \ this equation, oh, please tell me what the</span> <span m='560000'>units of temperature\
  \ are. How you are measuring</span> <span m='564000'>temperature makes no difference\
  \ to this equation.</span> <span m='567000'>k1 still has units. What units does\
  \ it have?</span> <span m='572000'>It's been simplified because it now has the units\
  \ of,</span> <span m='577000'>since this is dimensionless and this is dimensionless,</span>\
  \ <span m='582000'>it has the units of inverse time.</span> <span m='585000'>So,\
  \ k1, whereas it had units involving both degrees and</span> <span m='591000'>seconds\
  \ before, now it has inverse time as its</span> <span m='595000'>units. And, moreover,</span>\
  \ <span m='597000'>there's one less constant. So, one less constant in the</span>\
  \ <span m='602000'>equation. It just looks better.</span> <span m='607000'>This\
  \ business, I think you know that k1,</span> <span m='611000'>the process of forming\
  \ k1 out of k M cubed is</span> <span m='618000'>called lumping constants. I think\
  \ they use standard</span> <span m='623000'>terminology in physics and engineering\
  \ courses.</span> <span m='630000'>Try to get all the constants together like this.</span>\
  \ <span m='633000'>And then you lump them there. They are lumped for you,</span>\
  \ <span m='636000'>and then you just give the lump a new name.</span> <span m='639000'>So,\
  \ that's an example of scaling.</span> <span m='641000'>Watch out for when you can\
  \ use that.</span> <span m='643000'>For example, it would have probably been a</span>\
  \ <span m='646000'>good thing to use in the first problem set when you were</span>\
  \ <span m='650000'>handling this problem of drug elimination and hormone</span>\
  \ <span m='653000'>elimination production inside of the thing.</span> <span m='656000'>You\
  \ could lump constants, and as was done to some extent</span> <span m='660000'>on\
  \ the solutions to get a neater looking answer,</span> <span m='663000'>one without\
  \ so many constants in it.</span> <span m='667000'>Okay, let's now go to serious\
  \ stuff, where we are actually</span> <span m='671000'>going to make changes of\
  \ variables which we hope will</span> <span m='676000'>render unsolvable equations\
  \ suddenly solvable.</span> <span m='680000'>Now, I'm going to do that by making\
  \ substitutions.</span> <span m='684000'>But, it's, I think, quite important to\
  \ watch up</span> <span m='688000'>there are two kinds of substitutions.</span>\
  \ <span m='691000'>There are direct substitutions. That's where you introduce a</span>\
  \ <span m='697000'>new variable. I don't know how to write this</span> <span m='701000'>on\
  \ the board. I'll just write it</span> <span m='703000'>schematically. So, it's\
  \ one which says that</span> <span m='707000'>the new variable is equal to some\
  \ combination of the old</span> <span m='712000'>variables. The other kind of substitution</span>\
  \ <span m='716000'>is inverse. It's just the reverse.</span> <span m='720000'>Here,\
  \ you say that the old variables are some combination</span> <span m='724000'>of\
  \ the new. Now, often you'll have to stick</span> <span m='727000'>in a few old\
  \ variables, too.</span> <span m='729000'>But the basic, it's what appears on the</span>\
  \ <span m='732000'>left-hand side. Is it a new variable that</span> <span m='735000'>appears\
  \ on the left-hand side by itself, or is it the old</span> <span m='739000'>variable\
  \ that appears on the left-hand side?</span> <span m='743000'>Now, right here, we\
  \ have an example.</span> <span m='745000'>If I did it as a direct substitution,</span>\
  \ <span m='748000'>I would have written T1 equals T over M.</span> <span m='754000'>That's\
  \ the way I define the new variable, which of course you</span> <span m='758000'>have\
  \ to do if you're introducing it.</span> <span m='761000'>But when I actually did\
  \ the substitution,</span> <span m='764000'>I did the inverse substitution. Namely,\
  \ I used T equals T1,</span> <span m='768000'>M times T1. And,</span> <span m='770000'>the\
  \ reason for doing that was because it was the capital T's</span> <span m='775000'>that\
  \ faced me in the equation and I had to have something to</span> <span m='779000'>replace\
  \ them with. Now, you see this already in</span> <span m='783000'>calculus, this\
  \ distinction. But that might have been a year</span> <span m='787000'>and a half\
  \ ago. Just let me remind you,</span> <span m='790000'>typically in calculus, for\
  \ example,</span> <span m='792000'>when you want to do this kind of integral, let's\
  \ say,</span> <span m='795000'>x times the square root of one minus x squared dx,</span>\
  \ <span m='799000'>the substitution you'd use for</span> <span m='803000'>that is\
  \ u equals one minus x squared,</span> <span m='806000'>right? And then, you calculate,</span>\
  \ <span m='808000'>and then you would observe that this, the x dx,</span> <span\
  \ m='811000'>more or less makes up du, apart from a constant factor,</span> <span\
  \ m='815000'>there. So, this would be an example of</span> <span m='819000'>direct\
  \ substitution. You put it in and convert the</span> <span m='822000'>integral into\
  \ an integral of u. What would be an example of</span> <span m='826000'>inverse\
  \ substitution? Well, if I take away the x and</span> <span m='830000'>ask you,\
  \ instead, to do this integral,</span> <span m='832000'>then you know that the right\
  \ thing to do is not to start with</span> <span m='836000'>u, but to start with\
  \ the x and write x equals sine or cosine u.</span> <span m='842000'>So, this is\
  \ a direct substitution in that integral,</span> <span m='845000'>but this integral\
  \ calls for an inverse substitution in order to</span> <span m='849000'>be able\
  \ to do it. And notice, they would look</span> <span m='852000'>practically the\
  \ same. But, of course,</span> <span m='855000'>as you know from your experience,\
  \ they are not.</span> <span m='858000'>They're very different. Okay, so I'm going\
  \ to watch for</span> <span m='861000'>that distinction as I do these examples.</span>\
  \ <span m='864000'>The first one I want to do is an example as a direct</span> <span\
  \ m='868000'>substitution.</span> <span m='887000'>So, it applies to the equation\
  \ of the form y prime equals,</span> <span m='892000'>there are two kinds of terms\
  \ on the right-hand side.</span> <span m='896000'>Let's use p of x, p of x times\
  \ y plus q of x</span> <span m='900000'>times any power whatsoever of y.</span>\
  \ <span m='905000'>Well, notice, for example,</span> <span m='907000'>if n were\
  \ zero, what kind of equation would</span> <span m='911000'>this be? y to the n\
  \ would be</span> <span m='914000'>one, and this would be a linear equation, which\
  \ you know how to</span> <span m='920000'>solve. So, n equals zero we already</span>\
  \ <span m='923000'>know how to do. So, let's assume that n is not</span> <span m='927000'>zero,\
  \ so that we're in new territory.</span> <span m='933000'>Well, if n were equal\
  \ to one, you could separate variables.</span> <span m='938000'>So, that too is\
  \ not exciting. But, nonetheless,</span> <span m='942000'>it will be included in\
  \ what I'm going to say now.</span> <span m='946000'>If n is two or three, or n\
  \ could be one half.</span> <span m='950000'>So anything: even zero is all right.</span>\
  \ <span m='953000'>It's just silly. Any number: it could be</span> <span m='957000'>negative.\
  \ n equals minus five.</span> <span m='959000'>That would be fine also. This kind\
  \ of equation,</span> <span m='964000'>to give it its name, is called the Bernoulli</span>\
  \ <span m='968000'>equation, named after which Bernoulli, I haven't the</span> <span\
  \ m='971000'>faintest idea. There were, I think,</span> <span m='974000'>three or\
  \ four of them. And, they fought with each</span> <span m='978000'>other. But, they\
  \ were all smart.</span> <span m='980000'>Now, the key trick, if you like,</span>\
  \ <span m='983000'>method, to solving any Bernoulli equation,</span> <span m='986000'>let\
  \ me call another thing. Most important is what's</span> <span m='990000'>missing.\
  \ It must not have a pure x term</span> <span m='994000'>in it. And that goes for\
  \ a constant</span> <span m='997000'>term. In other words,</span> <span m='998000'>it\
  \ must look exactly like this. Everything multiplied by y,</span> <span m='1003000'>or\
  \ a power of y, two terms.</span> <span m='1005000'>So, for example, if I add one\
  \ to this,</span> <span m='1008000'>the equation becomes non-doable.</span> <span\
  \ m='1011000'>Right, it's very easy to contaminate it into an equation</span> <span\
  \ m='1015000'>that's unsolvable. It's got to look just like</span> <span m='1019000'>that.\
  \ Now, you've got one on your</span> <span m='1023000'>homework. You've got several.</span>\
  \ <span m='1025000'>Both part one and part two have Bernoulli equations on them.</span>\
  \ <span m='1030000'>So, this is practical, in some sense.</span> <span m='1033000'>What\
  \ do we got? The idea is to divide by y to</span> <span m='1037000'>the n. Ignore\
  \ all formulas that you're</span> <span m='1040000'>given. Just remember that when\
  \ you see</span> <span m='1043000'>something that looks like this, or something\
  \ that you can turn</span> <span m='1048000'>into something that looks like this,\
  \ divide through by y to the</span> <span m='1054000'>nth power, no matter what\
  \ n is. All right, so y prime over y to</span> <span m='1060000'>the n is equal\
  \ to p of x times one over y to the n minus one,</span> <span m='1064000'>right,\
  \ plus q of x.</span> <span m='1069000'>Well, that certainly doesn't look any better\
  \ than what I</span> <span m='1073000'>started with. And, in your terms,</span>\
  \ <span m='1075000'>it probably looks somewhat worse because it's got all those</span>\
  \ <span m='1079000'>Y's at the denominator, and who wants to see them</span> <span\
  \ m='1083000'>there? But, look at it.</span> <span m='1086000'>In this very slightly\
  \ transformed Bernoulli equation</span> <span m='1090000'>is a linear equation struggling\
  \ to be free.</span> <span m='1094000'>Where is it? Why is it trying to be a linear</span>\
  \ <span m='1097000'>equation? Make a new variable,</span> <span m='1100000'>call\
  \ this hunk of it in new variable.</span> <span m='1103000'>Let's call it V. So,\
  \ V is equal to one over y to</span> <span m='1107000'>the n minus one.</span> <span\
  \ m='1110000'>Or, if you like, you can think of that as y to</span> <span m='1114000'>the\
  \ one minus n. What's V prime?</span> <span m='1119000'>So, this is the direct substitution\
  \ I am going to use,</span> <span m='1124000'>but of course, the problem is,</span>\
  \ <span m='1126000'>what am I going to use on this? Well, the little miracle</span>\
  \ <span m='1131000'>happens. What's the derivative of this?</span> <span m='1134000'>It\
  \ is one minus n times y to the negative n times y prime</span> <span m='1139000'>In\
  \ other words,</span> <span m='1144000'>up to a constant, this constant factor,</span>\
  \ <span m='1147000'>one minus n, it's exactly the left-hand side</span> <span m='1151000'>of\
  \ the equation. Well, let's make N not equal</span> <span m='1155000'>one either.\
  \ As I said, you could separate</span> <span m='1158000'>variables if n equals one.\
  \ What's the equation,</span> <span m='1162000'>then, turned into? A Bernoulli equation,</span>\
  \ <span m='1168000'>divided through in this way, is then turned into the</span>\
  \ <span m='1176000'>equation one minus n, sorry, V prime divided by one</span> <span\
  \ m='1184000'>minus n is equal to p of x times V plus q of x.</span> <span m='1195000'>It's\
  \ linear.</span> <span m='1201000'>And now, solve it as a linear equation.</span>\
  \ <span m='1203000'>Solve it as a linear equation. You notice, it's not in</span>\
  \ <span m='1206000'>standard form, not in standard linear form.</span> <span m='1209000'>To\
  \ do that, you're going to have to put the p on the other</span> <span m='1213000'>side.\
  \ That's okay,</span> <span m='1214000'>that term, on the other side, solve it,\
  \ and at the end,</span> <span m='1217000'>don't forget that you put in the V.</span>\
  \ <span m='1219000'>It wasn't in the original problem.</span> <span m='1222000'>So,\
  \ you have to convert the problem, the answer,</span> <span m='1225000'>back in\
  \ terms of y. It'll come out in terms of V,</span> <span m='1228000'>but you must\
  \ put it back in terms of y.</span> <span m='1232000'>Let's do a really simple example\
  \ just to illustrate the</span> <span m='1238000'>method, and to illustrate the\
  \ fact that I don't want you to</span> <span m='1245000'>memorize formulas. Learn\
  \ methods,</span> <span m='1249000'>not final formulas. So, suppose the equation\
  \ is,</span> <span m='1254000'>let's say, y prime equals y over x minus y squared.</span>\
  \ <span m='1261000'>That's a Bernoulli equation.</span> <span m='1266000'>I could,\
  \ of course, have concealed it by writing xy</span> <span m='1269000'>prime plus\
  \ xy prime minus xy equals negative y squared.</span> <span m='1273000'>Then, it\
  \ wouldn't look instantly like a Bernoulli</span> <span m='1276000'>equation. You\
  \ would have to stare at it a</span> <span m='1279000'>while and say, hey, that's\
  \ a Bernoulli</span> <span m='1282000'>equation. Okay, but so I'm handing it to</span>\
  \ <span m='1285000'>you a silver platter, as it were.</span> <span m='1287000'>So,\
  \ what do we do? Divide through by y squared.</span> <span m='1292000'>So, it's\
  \ y prime over y squared equals one over x times one over</span> <span m='1298000'>y\
  \ minus one.</span> <span m='1301000'>And now, the substitution, then, I'm going\
  \ to make,</span> <span m='1306000'>is for this thing. V equals one over y.</span>\
  \ <span m='1311000'>It's a direct substitution.</span> <span m='1313000'>V prime\
  \ is going to be negative one over y squared</span> <span m='1319000'>times y prime.\
  \ Don't forget to use the chain</span> <span m='1325000'>rule when you differentiate\
  \ with respect-- because the</span> <span m='1328000'>differentiation is with respect\
  \ to x, of course,</span> <span m='1332000'>not with respect to y. Okay, so what's\
  \ this thing?</span> <span m='1335000'>That's the left-hand side. The only thing\
  \ is it's got a</span> <span m='1339000'>negative sign. So, this is minus V prime</span>\
  \ <span m='1342000'>equals, one over x stays one over x, one over y.</span> <span\
  \ m='1346000'>So, it's V over x minus one.</span> <span m='1350000'>So, let's put\
  \ that in standard form.</span> <span m='1352000'>In standard form, it will look\
  \ like,</span> <span m='1355000'>first imagine multiplying it through by negative\
  \ one,</span> <span m='1359000'>and then putting this term on the other side.</span>\
  \ <span m='1362000'>And, it will turn into V prime plus V over X is equal to one.</span>\
  \ <span m='1367000'>So, that's the linear equation</span> <span m='1371000'>in standard\
  \ linear form that we are asked to solve.</span> <span m='1374000'>And, the solution\
  \ isn't very hard.</span> <span m='1377000'>The integrating factor is, well, I integrate\
  \ one over x.</span> <span m='1383000'>That makes log x. And, e to the log x,</span>\
  \ <span m='1385000'>so, it's e to the log x, which is, of course,</span> <span m='1389000'>just\
  \ x itself. So, I should multiply this</span> <span m='1392000'>through by x squared,\
  \ be able to integrate it.</span> <span m='1395000'>Now, some of you, I would hope,</span>\
  \ <span m='1397000'>just can see that right away, that if you multiply this</span>\
  \ <span m='1401000'>through by x, it's going to look good.</span> <span m='1404000'>So,\
  \ after we multiply through by x, which I get?</span> <span m='1407000'>(xV) prime\
  \ for the-- maybe I shouldn't skip a step.</span> <span m='1413000'>You are still\
  \ learning this stuff, so let's not skip a step.</span> <span m='1418000'>So, it\
  \ becomes x V prime plus V equals x,</span> <span m='1424000'>okay? After I multiplied\
  \ through by</span> <span m='1427000'>the integrating factor, this now says this\
  \ is xV prime,</span> <span m='1433000'>and I quickly check that that, in fact,\
  \ is what it's equal to,</span> <span m='1439000'>equals x, and therefore xV is\
  \ equal to one half x squared plus</span> <span m='1445000'>a constant. And,</span>\
  \ <span m='1448000'>therefore, V is equal to one half x plus C over x.</span> <span\
  \ m='1454000'>You can leave it at that form,</span> <span m='1459000'>or you can\
  \ combine terms. It doesn't matter much.</span> <span m='1463000'>Am I done? The\
  \ answer is,</span> <span m='1465000'>no I am not done, because nobody reading this</span>\
  \ <span m='1469000'>answer would know what V was. V wasn't in the original</span>\
  \ <span m='1473000'>problem. It was y that was in the</span> <span m='1475000'>original\
  \ problem. And therefore,</span> <span m='1477000'>the relation is, one is the reciprocal\
  \ of the</span> <span m='1480000'>other. And therefore,</span> <span m='1481000'>I\
  \ have to turn this expression upside down.</span> <span m='1484000'>Well, if you're\
  \ going to have to turn it upside down,</span> <span m='1487000'>you probably should\
  \ make it look a little better.</span> <span m='1490000'>Let's rewrite it as x squared\
  \ plus 2c,</span> <span m='1493000'>combining fractions, I think they call it in\
  \ high</span> <span m='1496000'>school or elementary school, plus 2c.</span> <span\
  \ m='1500000'>How's that? x squared plus 2c divided by 2x.</span> <span m='1503000'>Now,\
  \ 2c, you don't call it</span> <span m='1507000'>constant 2c because this is just\
  \ as arbitrary to call it c1.</span> <span m='1512000'>So, I'll call that, so, my\
  \ answer will be y equals</span> <span m='1516000'>2x divided by x squared plus\
  \ an arbitrary constant.</span> <span m='1520000'>But, to indicate it's different\
  \ from that one,</span> <span m='1523000'>I'll call it C1. C1 is</span> <span m='1527000'>two\
  \ times the old one, but that doesn't really matter.</span> <span m='1531000'>So,\
  \ there's the solution. It has an arbitrary constant in</span> <span m='1537000'>it,\
  \ but you note it's not an additive arbitrary constant.</span> <span m='1540000'>The\
  \ arbitrary constant is tucked into the solution.</span> <span m='1544000'>If you\
  \ had to satisfy an initial condition,</span> <span m='1547000'>you would take this\
  \ form, and starting from this form,</span> <span m='1550000'>figure out what C1\
  \ was in order to satisfy that initial</span> <span m='1554000'>condition. Thus,\
  \ Bernoulli equation is</span> <span m='1557000'>solved. Our first Bernoulli equation:</span>\
  \ <span m='1559000'>isn't that exciting? So, here was the equation,</span> <span\
  \ m='1565000'>and there is its solution. Now, the one I'm asking you to</span> <span\
  \ m='1571000'>solve on the problem set in part two is no harder than this,</span>\
  \ <span m='1578000'>except I ask you some hard questions about it,</span> <span\
  \ m='1584000'>not very hard, but a little hard about it.</span> <span m='1590000'>I\
  \ hope you will find them interesting questions.</span> <span m='1593000'>You already\
  \ have the experimental evidence from the</span> <span m='1597000'>first problem\
  \ set, and the problem is to explain</span> <span m='1600000'>the experimental evidence\
  \ by actually solving the equation in</span> <span m='1605000'>the scene. I think\
  \ you'll find it</span> <span m='1607000'>interesting. But, maybe that's just a\
  \ pious</span> <span m='1611000'>hope. Okay, I like,</span> <span m='1612000'>now,\
  \ to turn to the second method, where a second class of</span> <span m='1616000'>equations\
  \ which require inverse substitution,</span> <span m='1620000'>and those are equations,\
  \ which are called homogeneous,</span> <span m='1624000'>a highly overworked word\
  \ in differential equations,</span> <span m='1628000'>and in mathematics in general.\
  \ But, it's unfortunately just</span> <span m='1634000'>the right word to describe\
  \ them. So, these are homogeneous,</span> <span m='1639000'>first-order ODE's. Now,\
  \ I already used the word in</span> <span m='1643000'>one context in talking about\
  \ the linear equations when zero is</span> <span m='1648000'>the right hand side.\
  \ This is different,</span> <span m='1652000'>but nonetheless, the two uses of the\
  \ word have</span> <span m='1655000'>the same common source. The homogeneous differential</span>\
  \ <span m='1659000'>equation, homogeneous newspeak, is y prime equals,</span> <span\
  \ m='1663000'>it's a question of what the right hand side looks like.</span> <span\
  \ m='1667000'>And, now, the supposed way to say it is, you should be able to</span>\
  \ <span m='1672000'>write the right-hand side as a function of a combined variable,</span>\
  \ <span m='1677000'>y divided by x. In other words,</span> <span m='1681000'>after\
  \ fooling around with the right hand side a little bit,</span> <span m='1686000'>you\
  \ should be able to write it so that every time a variable</span> <span m='1691000'>appears,\
  \ it's always in the combination y over x.</span> <span m='1695000'>Let me give\
  \ some examples. For example,</span> <span m='1699000'>suppose y prime were, let's\
  \ say, x squared y divided</span> <span m='1703000'>by x cubed plus y cubed.</span>\
  \ <span m='1709000'>Well, that doesn't look in that form.</span> <span m='1711000'>Well,\
  \ yes it is. Imagine dividing the top and</span> <span m='1714000'>bottom by x cubed.\
  \ What would you get?</span> <span m='1717000'>The top would be y over x, if you\
  \ divided it by x</span> <span m='1720000'>cubed. And, if I divide the bottom by</span>\
  \ <span m='1723000'>x cubed, also, which, of course,</span> <span m='1725000'>doesn't\
  \ change the value of the fraction, as they say in</span> <span m='1729000'>elementary\
  \ school, one plus (y over x) cubed.</span> <span m='1732000'>So, this is the way\
  \ it started</span> <span m='1735000'>out looking, but you just said ah-ha, that\
  \ was a homogeneous</span> <span m='1739000'>equation because I could see it could\
  \ be written that way.</span> <span m='1745000'>How about another homogeneous equation?</span>\
  \ <span m='1750000'>How about x y prime? Is that a homogeneous equation?</span>\
  \ <span m='1758000'>Of course it is: otherwise, why would I be</span> <span m='1764000'>talking\
  \ about it? If you divide through by x,</span> <span m='1769000'>you can tuck it\
  \ inside the radical, the square root,</span> <span m='1773000'>if you remember\
  \ to square it when you do that.</span> <span m='1776000'>And, it becomes the square\
  \ root of x squared over x squared,</span> <span m='1781000'>which is one, plus\
  \ y squared over x squared.</span> <span m='1784000'>It's homogeneous.</span> <span\
  \ m='1787000'>Now, you might say, hey, this looks like you had to</span> <span m='1790000'>be\
  \ rather clever to figure out if an equation is homogeneous.</span> <span m='1795000'>Is\
  \ there some other way? Yeah, there is another way,</span> <span m='1798000'>and\
  \ it's the other way which explains why it's called</span> <span m='1802000'>homogeneous.\
  \ You can think of it this way.</span> <span m='1807000'>It's an equation which\
  \ is, in modern speak,</span> <span m='1812000'>invariant, invariant under the operation\
  \ zoom.</span> <span m='1818000'>What is zoom? Zoom is, you increase the scale</span>\
  \ <span m='1823000'>equally on both axes. So, the zoom operation is the</span> <span\
  \ m='1830000'>one which sends x into a times x,</span> <span m='1836000'>and y into\
  \ a times y.</span> <span m='1842000'>In other words, you change the scale on both</span>\
  \ <span m='1846000'>axes by the same factor, a.</span> <span m='1848000'>Now, what\
  \ I say is, gee, maybe you shouldn't write</span> <span m='1853000'>it like this.\
  \ Why don't we say,</span> <span m='1856000'>we introduce, how about this?</span>\
  \ <span m='1860000'>So, think of it as a change of variables.</span> <span m='1862000'>We\
  \ will write it like that. So, you can put here an equals</span> <span m='1866000'>sign,\
  \ if you don't know what this meaningless arrow means.</span> <span m='1870000'>So,\
  \ I'm making this change of variables, and I'm describing it</span> <span m='1874000'>as\
  \ an inverse substitution. But of course,</span> <span m='1876000'>it wouldn't make\
  \ any difference.</span> <span m='1879000'>It's exactly the same as the direct substitution\
  \ I started</span> <span m='1882000'>out with underscaling. The only difference\
  \ is,</span> <span m='1885000'>I'm not using different scales on both axes.</span>\
  \ <span m='1888000'>I'm expanding them both equally.</span> <span m='1892000'>That's\
  \ what I mean by zoom. Now, what happens to the</span> <span m='1896000'>equation?\
  \ Well, what happens to dy over</span> <span m='1900000'>dx? Well, dx is a dx1.</span>\
  \ <span m='1903000'>dy is a dy1.</span> <span m='1907000'>And therefore, the ratio,\
  \ dy by dx is the same</span> <span m='1911000'>as dy1 over dx1.</span> <span m='1914000'>So,\
  \ the left-hand side becomes dy1 over dx1,</span> <span m='1918000'>and the right-hand\
  \ side becomes F of, well, y over x is the same</span> <span m='1924000'>as y over,\
  \ since I've scaled them equally,</span> <span m='1928000'>this is the same as y1\
  \ over x1.</span> <span m='1934000'>So, it's y1 over x1, and the net effect is I\
  \ simply,</span> <span m='1938000'>everywhere I have an x, I change it to x1,</span>\
  \ <span m='1942000'>and wherever I have a y, I change it to y1,</span> <span m='1945000'>which,\
  \ what's in a name? It's the identical equation.</span> <span m='1951000'>So, I\
  \ haven't changed the equation at all via zoom</span> <span m='1955000'>transformation.\
  \ And, that's what makes it</span> <span m='1958000'>homogeneous. That's not an\
  \ uncommon use of</span> <span m='1962000'>the word homogeneous. When you say space\
  \ is</span> <span m='1965000'>homogeneous, every direction, well, that means,</span>\
  \ <span m='1969000'>I don't know. It means, okay,</span> <span m='1971000'>I'm getting\
  \ into trouble there. I'll let it go since I can't</span> <span m='1976000'>prepare\
  \ any better, I haven't prepared any better</span> <span m='1980000'>explanation,\
  \ but this is a pretty good one.</span> <span m='1986000'>Okay, so, suppose we've\
  \ got a homogeneous equation.</span> <span m='1993000'>How do we solve it? So, here's\
  \ our equation,</span> <span m='2000000'>F of y over x. Well, what substitution\
  \ would</span> <span m='2009000'>you like to make? Obviously, we should make a</span>\
  \ <span m='2014000'>direct substitution, z equals y over x.</span> <span m='2018000'>So,\
  \ why did he say that this was going to be an example of</span> <span m='2022000'>inverse\
  \ substitution? Because I wanted to confuse</span> <span m='2025000'>you. But look,\
  \ that's fine.</span> <span m='2027000'>If you write it in that form, you'll know\
  \ exactly what to do</span> <span m='2031000'>with the right-hand side. And, this\
  \ is why everybody</span> <span m='2035000'>loves to do that. But for Charlie,</span>\
  \ <span m='2037000'>you have to substitute into the left-hand side as well.</span>\
  \ <span m='2043000'>And, I can testify, for many years of looking with</span> <span\
  \ m='2046000'>sinking heart at examination papers, what happens if you try</span>\
  \ <span m='2050000'>to make a direct substitution like this?</span> <span m='2053000'>You\
  \ say, oh, I need z prime.</span> <span m='2055000'>z prime equals, well, I better\
  \ use the quotient</span> <span m='2058000'>rule for differentiating that. And,\
  \ it comes out this long,</span> <span m='2062000'>and then either a long pause,\
  \ what do I do now?</span> <span m='2066000'>Because it's not at all obvious what\
  \ to do at that point.</span> <span m='2070000'>Or, much worse, two pages of frantic</span>\
  \ <span m='2072000'>calculations, and giving up in total despair.</span> <span m='2077000'>Now,\
  \ the reason for that is because you tried to do it</span> <span m='2080000'>making\
  \ a direct substitution. All you have to do instead is</span> <span m='2085000'>use\
  \ it, treat it as an inverse substitution,</span> <span m='2088000'>write y equals\
  \ zx. What's the motivation for doing</span> <span m='2091000'>that? It's clear\
  \ from the equation.</span> <span m='2094000'>This goes through all of mathematics.</span>\
  \ <span m='2097000'>Whenever you have to change a variable, excuse me,</span> <span\
  \ m='2100000'>whenever you have to change a variable, look at what you have</span>\
  \ <span m='2105000'>to substitute for, and focus your attention on</span> <span\
  \ m='2108000'>that. I need to know what y prime is.</span> <span m='2112000'>Okay,\
  \ well, then I better know what y is.</span> <span m='2115000'>If I know what y\
  \ is, do I know what y prime is?</span> <span m='2119000'>Oh, of course. y prime\
  \ is z prime x plus z</span> <span m='2122000'>times the derivative of this factor,\
  \ which is one.</span> <span m='2126000'>And now, I turned with that one</span>\
  \ <span m='2131000'>stroke, the equation has now become z prime x plus z is equal</span>\
  \ <span m='2136000'>to F of z. Well, I don't know.</span> <span m='2140000'>Can\
  \ I solve that? Sure.</span> <span m='2142000'>That can be solved because this is\
  \ x times dz / dx.</span> <span m='2148000'>Just put the z on the other side, it's\
  \ F of z minus z.</span> <span m='2153000'>And now, this side is just a</span> <span\
  \ m='2155000'>function of z. Separate variables.</span> <span m='2160000'>And, the\
  \ only thing to watch out for is, at the end,</span> <span m='2163000'>the z was\
  \ your business. You've got to put the answer</span> <span m='2167000'>back in terms\
  \ of z and y. Okay, let's work an example of</span> <span m='2171000'>this. Since\
  \ I haven't done any</span> <span m='2173000'>modeling yet this period, let's make\
  \ a little model,</span> <span m='2177000'>differential equations model. It's a\
  \ physical situation,</span> <span m='2181000'>which will be solved by an equation.</span>\
  \ <span m='2184000'>And, guess what? The equation will turn out to</span> <span\
  \ m='2187000'>be homogeneous. Okay, so the situation is as</span> <span m='2192000'>follows.\
  \ We are in the Caribbean</span> <span m='2194000'>somewhere, a little isolated\
  \ island somewhere with a little</span> <span m='2199000'>lighthouse on it at the\
  \ origin, and a beam of light shines from</span> <span m='2204000'>the lighthouse.\
  \ The beam of light can rotate</span> <span m='2208000'>the way the lighthouse beams.\
  \ But, this particular beam is</span> <span m='2213000'>being controlled by a guy\
  \ in the lighthouse who can aim it</span> <span m='2217000'>wherever he wants. And,\
  \ the reason he's interested</span> <span m='2221000'>in aiming it wherever he wants\
  \ is there's a drug boat here,</span> <span m='2226000'>[LAUGHTER] which has just\
  \ been caught in the beam of light.</span> <span m='2233000'>So, the drug boat,\
  \ which has just been caught in a</span> <span m='2236000'>beam of light, and feels\
  \ it'd a better escape.</span> <span m='2240000'>Now, the lighthouse keeper wants\
  \ to keep the drug boat;</span> <span m='2244000'>the light is shining on it so\
  \ that the U.S.</span> <span m='2247000'>Coast Guard helicopters can zoom over it\
  \ and do whatever</span> <span m='2251000'>they do to drug boats, --</span> <span\
  \ m='2254000'>-- I don't know. So, the drug boat immediately</span> <span m='2257000'>has\
  \ to follow an escape strategy.</span> <span m='2259000'>And, the only one that\
  \ occurs to him is, well,</span> <span m='2262000'>he wants to go further away,\
  \ of course, from the lighthouse.</span> <span m='2267000'>On the other hand, it\
  \ doesn't seem sensible to do</span> <span m='2270000'>it in a straight line because\
  \ the beam will keep shining on</span> <span m='2274000'>him. So, he fixes the boat\
  \ at some</span> <span m='2277000'>angle, let's say, and goes off so that the angle</span>\
  \ <span m='2280000'>stays 45 degrees. So, it goes so that the angle</span> <span\
  \ m='2285000'>between the beam and maybe, draw the beam a little less</span> <span\
  \ m='2291000'>like a 45 degree angle. So, the angle between the beam</span> <span\
  \ m='2296000'>and the boat, the boat's path is always 45</span> <span m='2300000'>degrees,\
  \ goes at a constant 45 degree angle to the beam,</span> <span m='2306000'>hoping\
  \ thereby to escape. On the other hand,</span> <span m='2310000'>of course, the\
  \ lighthouse guy keeps the beam always on the</span> <span m='2316000'>boat. So,\
  \ it's not clear it's a good</span> <span m='2320000'>strategy, but this is a differential\
  \ equations class.</span> <span m='2324000'>The question is, what's the path of\
  \ the boat?</span> <span m='2328000'>What's the boat's path? Now, an obvious question\
  \ is,</span> <span m='2332000'>why is this a problem in differential equations at\
  \ all?</span> <span m='2337000'>In other words, looking at this,</span> <span m='2339000'>you\
  \ might scratch your head and try to think of different ways</span> <span m='2344000'>to\
  \ solve it. But, what suggests that it's</span> <span m='2349000'>going to be a\
  \ problem in differential equations?</span> <span m='2353000'>The answer is, you're\
  \ looking for a path.</span> <span m='2357000'>The answer is going to be a curve.</span>\
  \ <span m='2360000'>A curve means a function. We are looking for an unknown</span>\
  \ <span m='2364000'>function, in other words. And, what type of information</span>\
  \ <span m='2369000'>do we have about the function? The only information we have</span>\
  \ <span m='2374000'>about the function is something about its slope,</span> <span\
  \ m='2378000'>that its slope makes a constant 45\xB0 angle with the lighthouse</span>\
  \ <span m='2384000'>beam. Its slope makes a constant</span> <span m='2393000'>known\
  \ angle to a known angle. Well, if you are trying to find</span> <span m='2404000'>a\
  \ function, and all you know is something about its slope,</span> <span m='2409000'>that\
  \ is a problem in differential equations.</span> <span m='2413000'>Well, let's try\
  \ to solve it. Well, let's see.</span> <span m='2416000'>Well, let me draw just\
  \ a little bit.</span> <span m='2419000'>So, here's the horizontal. Let's introduce\
  \ the</span> <span m='2423000'>coordinates. In other words,</span> <span m='2425000'>there's\
  \ the horizontal and here's the boat to indicate</span> <span m='2430000'>where\
  \ I am with respect to the picture.</span> <span m='2435000'>So, here's the boat.\
  \ Here's the beam,</span> <span m='2438000'>and the path of the boat is going to\
  \ make a 45\xB0 angle with</span> <span m='2444000'>it. So, this is the path that\
  \ we</span> <span m='2447000'>are talking about. And now, let's label what I</span>\
  \ <span m='2451000'>know. Well, this angle is 45\xB0.</span> <span m='2454000'>This\
  \ angle, I don't know, but of course I can calculate</span> <span m='2460000'>it\
  \ easily enough because it has to do with, if I know the</span> <span m='2465000'>coordinates\
  \ of this point, (x, y), then of course that</span> <span m='2471000'>horizontal\
  \ angle, I know the slope of this line,</span> <span m='2475000'>and that angle\
  \ will be related to the slope.</span> <span m='2482000'>So, let's call this alpha.\
  \ And now, what I want to know is</span> <span m='2489000'>what the slope of the\
  \ whole path is.</span> <span m='2495000'>So, y prime-- let's call y equals y of\
  \ x,</span> <span m='2502000'>the unknown function whose path, whose graph is going\
  \ to be</span> <span m='2510000'>the boat's path, unknown graph.</span> <span m='2514000'>What's\
  \ its slope? Well, its slope is the tangent</span> <span m='2520000'>of the sum\
  \ of these two angles, alpha plus 45\xB0.</span> <span m='2528000'>Now, what do\
  \ I know? Well, I know that the tangent</span> <span m='2531000'>of alpha is how\
  \ much? That's y over x.</span> <span m='2534000'>In other words,</span> <span m='2536000'>if\
  \ this was the point, x over y, this is the angle it</span> <span m='2539000'>makes\
  \ with a horizontal, if you think of it over here.</span> <span m='2543000'>So,\
  \ this angle is the same as that one, and it's y over,</span> <span m='2546000'>its\
  \ slope of that line is y over x.</span> <span m='2550000'>So, the tangent of the\
  \ angle is y over x.</span> <span m='2552000'>How about the tangent of 45\xB0? That's\
  \ one, and there's a</span> <span m='2556000'>formula. This is the hard part.</span>\
  \ <span m='2558000'>All you have to know is that the formula exists,</span> <span\
  \ m='2561000'>and then you will look it up if you have forgotten it,</span> <span\
  \ m='2564000'>relating the tangent or giving you the tangent of the sum of</span>\
  \ <span m='2568000'>two angles, and you can, if you like,</span> <span m='2570000'>clever,\
  \ derive it from the formula for the sign and cosine</span> <span m='2574000'>of\
  \ the sum of two angles. But, one peak is worth a</span> <span m='2577000'>thousand\
  \ finesses. So, it is the tangent of alpha</span> <span m='2582000'>plus the tangent\
  \ of 45\xB0. Let me read it out in all its</span> <span m='2586000'>gory details,\
  \ divided by one,</span> <span m='2588000'>so you'll at least learn the formula,\
  \ one minus tangent alpha</span> <span m='2592000'>times tangent 45\xB0.</span>\
  \ <span m='2595000'>This would work for the tangent of the sum of any two angles.</span>\
  \ <span m='2600000'>That's the formula. So, what do I get then?</span> <span m='2603000'>y\
  \ prime is equal to the tangent of alpha, which is y over x,</span> <span m='2607000'>oh,\
  \ I like that combination, plus one, divided by (one minus</span> <span m='2612000'>y\
  \ over x times one).</span> <span m='2617000'>Now, there is no reason for doing\
  \ anything to it,</span> <span m='2620000'>but let's make it look a little prettier,\
  \ and thereby,</span> <span m='2624000'>make it less obvious that it's a homogeneous\
  \ equation.</span> <span m='2628000'>If I multiply top and bottom by x, it looks\
  \ prettier.</span> <span m='2632000'>x plus y over x minus y equals y prime.</span>\
  \ <span m='2635000'>That's our differential equation.</span> <span m='2640000'>But,\
  \ notice, that let step to make it look</span> <span m='2642000'>pretty has undone\
  \ the good work. It's fine if you immediately</span> <span m='2646000'>recognize\
  \ this as being a homogeneous equation because you</span> <span m='2650000'>can\
  \ divide the top and bottom by x.</span> <span m='2652000'>But here, it's a lot\
  \ clearer that it's a homogeneous equation</span> <span m='2656000'>because it's\
  \ already been written in the right form.</span> <span m='2660000'>Okay, let's solve\
  \ it now, since we know what to do.</span> <span m='2663000'>We're going to use\
  \ as the new variable, z equals y over x.</span> <span m='2667000'>And, as I wrote\
  \ up there for y</span> <span m='2673000'>prime, we'll substitute z prime x plus\
  \ z.</span> <span m='2680000'>And, with that, let's solve.</span> <span m='2684000'>Let's\
  \ solve it. The equation becomes z prime x</span> <span m='2690000'>plus z is equal\
  \ to z plus one over one minus z.</span> <span m='2697000'>We want to separate variables,</span>\
  \ <span m='2704000'>so you have to put all the z's on one side.</span> <span m='2707000'>So,\
  \ this is going to be x, dz / dx equals this thing minus</span> <span m='2711000'>z,\
  \ which is (z plus one) over (one minus z) minus z.</span> <span m='2714000'>And\
  \ now, as you realize,</span> <span m='2718000'>putting it on the other side, I'm\
  \ going to have to turn it</span> <span m='2722000'>upside down. Just as before,</span>\
  \ <span m='2724000'>if you have to turn something upside down, it's better to</span>\
  \ <span m='2728000'>combine the terms, and make it one tiny little</span> <span\
  \ m='2731000'>fraction. Otherwise, you are in for quite</span> <span m='2735000'>a\
  \ lot of mess if you don't do this nicely.</span> <span m='2739000'>So, z plus one\
  \ minus z, that gets rid of the z's.</span> <span m='2743000'>The numerator is one\
  \ minus z squared over one minus z,</span> <span m='2748000'>I hope, one, is that\
  \ right,</span> <span m='2750000'>(one plus z squared) over (one minus z).</span>\
  \ <span m='2756000'>And so, the question is dz,</span> <span m='2758000'>and put\
  \ this on the other side and turn it upside down.</span> <span m='2765000'>So, that\
  \ will be (one minus z) over (one plus z squared) on the</span> <span m='2770000'>left-hand\
  \ side and on the right-hand side,</span> <span m='2774000'>dx over x. Well, that's\
  \ ready to be</span> <span m='2777000'>integrated just as it stands. The right-hand\
  \ side integrates</span> <span m='2783000'>to be log x. The left-hand side is the\
  \ sum</span> <span m='2786000'>of two terms. The integral of one over one</span>\
  \ <span m='2790000'>plus z squared is the arc tangent of z,</span> <span m='2794000'>maybe?\
  \ The derivative of this is one</span> <span m='2797000'>over one plus z squared.</span>\
  \ <span m='2800000'>How about the term z over one plus z squared?</span> <span m='2804000'>Well,\
  \ that integrates to be a</span> <span m='2806000'>logarithm. It is more or less\
  \ the</span> <span m='2808000'>logarithm of one plus z squared.</span> <span m='2811000'>If\
  \ I differentiate this, I get one over one plus z^2</span> <span m='2814000'>times\
  \ 2z, but I wish I had negative z</span> <span m='2818000'>there instead. Therefore,\
  \ I should put a minus</span> <span m='2821000'>sign, and I should multiply that\
  \ by half to make it come out</span> <span m='2825000'>right. And, this is log x\
  \ on the right</span> <span m='2829000'>hand side plus, put in that arbitrary constant.</span>\
  \ <span m='2833000'>And now what? Well, let's now fool around</span> <span m='2836000'>with\
  \ it a little bit. The arc tangent,</span> <span m='2839000'>I'm going to simultaneously,\
  \ no, two steps.</span> <span m='2842000'>I have to remember your innocence, although\
  \ probably a</span> <span m='2846000'>lot of you are better calculators than I am.</span>\
  \ <span m='2851000'>I'm going to change this, use as many laws of logarithms</span>\
  \ <span m='2855000'>as possible. I'm going to put this in the</span> <span m='2858000'>exponent,\
  \ and put this on the other side.</span> <span m='2861000'>That's going to turn\
  \ it into the log of the square root of</span> <span m='2865000'>one plus z squared.</span>\
  \ <span m='2868000'>And, this is going to be plus the log of x plus c.</span> <span\
  \ m='2873000'>And, now I'm going to make,</span> <span m='2875000'>go back and remember\
  \ that z equals y over x.</span> <span m='2880000'>So, this becomes the arc tangent\
  \ of y over x equals.</span> <span m='2884000'>Now, I combine the logarithms.</span>\
  \ <span m='2889000'>This is the log of x times this square root, right,</span> <span\
  \ m='2892000'>make one logarithm out of it, and then put z equals y over z.</span>\
  \ <span m='2896000'>And, you see that if you do</span> <span m='2899000'>that, it'll\
  \ be the log of x times the square root of one</span> <span m='2903000'>plus (y\
  \ over x) squared,</span> <span m='2907000'>and what is that? Well, if I put this\
  \ over x</span> <span m='2910000'>squared and take it out, it cancels that.</span>\
  \ <span m='2914000'>And, what you are left with is the log of the square root of\
  \ x</span> <span m='2918000'>squared plus y squared plus a constant.</span> <span\
  \ m='2922000'>Now, technically,</span> <span m='2923000'>you have solved the equation,\
  \ but not morally because,</span> <span m='2927000'>I mean, my God, what a mess!</span>\
  \ <span m='2929000'>Incredible path. It tells me absolutely nothing.</span> <span\
  \ m='2932000'>Wow, what is the screaming? Change me to polar coordinates.</span>\
  \ <span m='2936000'>What's the arc tangent of y over x?</span> <span m='2940000'>Theta.\
  \ In polar coordinates it's</span> <span m='2942000'>theta. This is r.</span> <span\
  \ m='2944000'>So, the curve is theta equals the log of r plus a constant.</span>\
  \ <span m='2949000'>And, I can make even that little better if I exponentiate</span>\
  \ <span m='2954000'>everything, exponentiate both sides, combine this in the usual</span>\
  \ <span m='2959000'>way, the and what you get is that r is equal to some other</span>\
  \ <span m='2964000'>constant times e to the theta.</span> <span m='2970000'>That's\
  \ the curve. It's called an exponential</span> <span m='2973000'>spiral, and that's\
  \ what our little boat goes in.</span> <span m='2977000'>And notice, probably if\
  \ I had set up the problem in polar</span> <span m='2982000'>coordinates from the\
  \ beginning, nobody would have been able to</span> <span m='2988000'>solve it. But,\
  \ anyone who did would have</span> <span m='2991000'>gotten that answer immediately.\
