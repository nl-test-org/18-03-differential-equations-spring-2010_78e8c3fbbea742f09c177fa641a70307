transcript: '<p><span m=''2000''>We''re going to start.</span> </p><p><span m=''31000''>We
  are going to start studying today, and for quite a while,</span> <span m=''37000''>the
  linear second-order differential equation with</span> <span m=''42000''>constant
  coefficients. In standard form,</span> <span m=''46000''>it looks like, there are
  various possible</span> <span m=''51000''>choices for the variable, unfortunately,</span>
  <span m=''55000''>so I hope it won''t disturb you much if I use one rather than</span>
  <span m=''61000''>another. I''m going to write it this way</span> <span m=''66000''>in
  standard form. I''ll use y as the dependent</span> <span m=''69000''>variable. Your
  book uses little p and</span> <span m=''72000''>little q. I''ll probably switch
  to that by</span> <span m=''76000''>next time. But, for today,</span> <span m=''78000''>I''d
  like to use the most neutral letters I can find that</span> <span m=''82000''>won''t
  interfere with anything else.</span> </p><p><span m=''85000''>So, of course call
  the constant coefficients,</span> <span m=''88000''>respectively, capital A and
  capital B.</span> </p><p><span m=''93000''>I''m going to assume for today that the
  right-hand side is</span> <span m=''97000''>zero. So, that means it''s what we</span>
  <span m=''100000''>call homogeneous. The left-hand side must be in</span> <span
  m=''104000''>this form for it to be linear, it''s second order because it</span>
  <span m=''109000''>involves a second derivative. These coefficients,</span> <span
  m=''113000''>A and B, are understood to be constant because,</span> <span m=''117000''>as
  I said, it has constant coefficients.</span> </p><p><span m=''122000''>Of course,
  that''s not the most general linear equation there</span> <span m=''126000''>could
  be. In general, it would be more</span> <span m=''128000''>general by making this
  a function of the dependent</span> <span m=''132000''>variable, x or t, whatever
  it''s called.</span> </p><p><span m=''135000''>Similarly, this could be a function
  of the dependent</span> <span m=''138000''>variable. Above all, the right-hand side</span>
  <span m=''141000''>can be a function of a variable rather than simply zero.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''145000''>In that case the equation is called inhomogeneous.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''150000''>But it has a different physical meaning, and therefore
  it''s</span> <span m=''154000''>customary to study that after this.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''156000''>You start with this. This is the case we start with,</span> <span m=''160000''>and
  then by the middle of next week we will be studying more</span> <span m=''164000''>general
  cases. But, it''s a good idea to start</span> <span m=''167000''>here. Your book
  starts with,</span> <span m=''169000''>in general, some theory of a general linear
  equation of</span> <span m=''173000''>second-order, and even higher order.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''175000''>I''m asking you to skip that for the time being.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''180000''>We''ll come back to it next Wednesday, it two lectures,</span>
  <span m=''183000''>in other words. I think it''s much better and</span> <span m=''186000''>essential
  for your problems at for you to get some experience</span> <span m=''190000''>with
  a simple type of equation. And then, you''ll understand the</span> <span m=''194000''>general
  theory, how it applies,</span> <span m=''196000''>a lot better, I think.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''197000''>So, let''s get experience here. The downside of that is
  that</span> <span m=''201000''>I''m going to have to assume a couple of things about
  the</span> <span m=''205000''>solution to this equation, how it looks;</span> <span
  m=''207000''>I don''t think that will upset you too much.</span> </p><p><span m=''212000''>So,
  what I''m going to assume, and we will justify it in a</span> <span m=''217000''>couple
  lectures, that the general solution,</span> <span m=''222000''>that is, the solution
  involving arbitrary constants,</span> <span m=''227000''>looks like this. y is equal--
  The arbitrary</span> <span m=''231000''>constants occur in a certain special way.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''236000''>There is c one y one plus c two y two.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''243000''>So, these are two arbitrary constants corresponding to the</span> <span
  m=''246000''>fact that we are solving a second-order equation.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''249000''>In general, the number of arbitrary constants in the</span> <span m=''251000''>solution
  is the same as the order of the equation because if</span> <span m=''255000''>it''s
  a second-order equation because if it''s a second-order</span> <span m=''258000''>equation,
  that means somehow or other, it may be concealed.</span> </p><p><span m=''261000''>But
  you''re going to have to integrate something twice to get</span> <span m=''265000''>the
  answer. And therefore,</span> <span m=''266000''>there should be two arbitrary constants.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''270000''>That''s very rough, but it sort of gives you the</span>
  <span m=''274000''>idea. Now, what are the y1 and y2?</span> </p><p><span m=''278000''>Well,
  as you can see, if these are arbitrary</span> <span m=''282000''>constants, if I
  take c2 to be zero and c1 to be one,</span> <span m=''288000''>that means that y1
  must be a solution to the equation,</span> <span m=''293000''>and similarly y2.
  So, where y1 and y2 are</span> <span m=''297000''>solutions. Now, what that shows
  you is</span> <span m=''302000''>that the task of solving this equation is reduced,</span>
  <span m=''305000''>in some sense, to finding just two solutions</span> <span m=''309000''>of
  it, somehow. All we have to do is find two</span> <span m=''312000''>solutions,
  and then we will have solved the equation because the</span> <span m=''317000''>general
  solution is made up in this way by multiplying those</span> <span m=''322000''>two
  solutions by arbitrary constants and adding them.</span> </p><p><span m=''326000''>So,
  the problem is, where do we get that solutions</span> <span m=''330000''>from? But,
  first of all,</span> <span m=''333000''>or rather, second or third of all, the initial
  conditions</span> <span m=''338000''>enter into the, I haven''t given you any initial</span>
  <span m=''342000''>conditions here, but if you have them,</span> <span m=''345000''>and
  I will illustrate them when I work problems,</span> <span m=''349000''>the initial
  conditions, well, the initial values are</span> <span m=''354000''>satisfied by
  choosing c1 and c2, are satisfied by choosing c1</span> <span m=''359000''>and c2
  properly. So, in other words,</span> <span m=''363000''>if you have an initial value
  problem to solve,</span> <span m=''368000''>that will be taken care of by the way
  those constants,</span> <span m=''374000''>c, enter into the solution. Okay, without
  further ado,</span> <span m=''379000''>there is a standard example, which I wish
  I had looked up in</span> <span m=''385000''>the physics syllabus for the first
  semester.</span> </p><p><span m=''390000''>Did you study the spring-mass-dashpot
  system in</span> <span m=''395000''>8.01? I''m embarrassed having to ask</span>
  <span m=''399000''>you. You did?</span> </p><p><span m=''400000''>Raise your hands
  if you did. Okay, that means you all did.</span> </p><p><span m=''404000''>Well,
  just let me draw an instant picture to remind you.</span> </p><p><span m=''409000''>So,
  this is a two second review.</span> </p><p><span m=''411000''>I don''t know how
  they draw the picture.</span> </p><p><span m=''414000''>Probably they don''t draw
  picture at all.</span> </p><p><span m=''417000''>They have some elaborate system
  here of the thing running back</span> <span m=''422000''>and forth. Well, in the
  math,</span> <span m=''424000''>we do that all virtually. So, here''s my system.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''430000''>That''s a fixed thing. Here''s a little spring.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''434000''>And, there''s a little car on the track here,</span> <span
  m=''438000''>I guess. So, there''s the mass,</span> <span m=''441000''>some mass
  in the little car, and motion is damped by what''s</span> <span m=''447000''>called
  a dashpot. A dashpot is the sort of thing,</span> <span m=''452000''>you see them
  in everyday life as door closers.</span> </p><p><span m=''455000''>They''re the
  thing up above that you never notice that prevent</span> <span m=''460000''>the
  door slamming shut. So, if you take one apart,</span> <span m=''463000''>it looks
  something like this. So, that''s the dash pot.</span> </p><p><span m=''467000''>It''s
  a chamber with a piston. This is a piston moving in and</span> <span m=''471000''>out,
  and compressing the air, releasing it,</span> <span m=''474000''>is what damps the
  motion of the thing.</span> </p><p><span m=''477000''>So, this is a dashpot, it''s
  usually called.</span> </p><p><span m=''482000''>And, here''s our mass in that little
  truck.</span> </p><p><span m=''485000''>And, here''s the spring. And then, the equation
  which</span> <span m=''489000''>governs it is, let''s call this x.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''491000''>I''m already changing, going to change the dependent</span> <span m=''495000''>variable
  from y to x, but that''s just for the sake of</span> <span m=''499000''>example,
  and because the track is horizontal,</span> <span m=''503000''>it seems more natural
  to call it x.</span> </p><p><span m=''507000''>There''s some equilibrium position
  somewhere,</span> <span m=''510000''>let''s say, here. That''s the position at which</span>
  <span m=''514000''>the mass wants to be, if the spring is not pulling on</span>
  <span m=''518000''>it or pushing on it, and the dashpot is happy.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''522000''>I guess we''d better have a longer dashpot here.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''526000''>So, this is the equilibrium position where nothing is</span> <span
  m=''530000''>happening. When you depart from that</span> <span m=''533000''>position,
  then the spring, if you go that way,</span> <span m=''537000''>the spring tries
  to pull the mass back.</span> </p><p><span m=''542000''>If it goes on the site,
  the spring tries to push the</span> <span m=''547000''>mass away. The dashpot,</span>
  <span m=''549000''>meanwhile, is doing its thing. And so, the force on the,</span>
  <span m=''554000''>m x double prime. That''s by Newton''s law,</span> <span m=''559000''>the
  force, comes from where? Well, there''s the spring</span> <span m=''564000''>pushing
  and pulling on it. That force is opposed.</span> </p><p><span m=''569000''>If x
  gets to be beyond zero, then the spring tries to pull</span> <span m=''574000''>it
  back. If it gets to the left of zero,</span> <span m=''579000''>if x gets to be
  negative, that that spring force is</span> <span m=''582000''>pushing it this way,
  wants to get rid of the mass.</span> </p><p><span m=''586000''>So, it should be
  minus kx, and this is from the spring,</span> <span m=''590000''>the fact that is
  proportional to the amount by which x varies.</span> </p><p><span m=''594000''>So,
  that''s called Hooke''s Law. Never mind that.</span> </p><p><span m=''598000''>This
  is a law. That''s a law,</span> <span m=''601000''>Newton''s law, okay, Newton,</span>
  <span m=''603000''>Hooke with an E, and the dashpot damping is</span> <span m=''606000''>proportional
  to the velocity. It''s not doing anything if the</span> <span m=''611000''>mass
  is not moving, even if it''s stretched way out</span> <span m=''615000''>of its
  equilibrium position. So, it resists the velocity.</span> </p><p><span m=''619000''>If
  the thing is trying to go that way, the dashpot resists</span> <span m=''624000''>it.
  It''s trying to go this way,</span> <span m=''626000''>the dashpot resists that,
  too.</span> </p><p><span m=''630000''>It''s always opposed to the velocity.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''632000''>And so, this is a dash pot damping.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''635000''>I don''t know whose law this is. So, it''s the force coming from</span>
  <span m=''639000''>the dashpot. And, when you write this out,</span> <span m=''642000''>the
  final result, therefore, is it''s m x double</span> <span m=''645000''>prime plus
  c x prime, it''s important to see where the</span> <span m=''649000''>various terms
  are, plus kx equals zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''652000''>And now, that''s still
  not in</span> <span m=''656000''>standard form. To put it in standard form,</span>
  <span m=''659000''>you must divide through by the mass.</span> </p><p><span m=''663000''>And,
  it will now read like this, plus k divided by m times</span> <span m=''667000''>x
  equals zero. And, that''s the equation</span> <span m=''670000''>governing the motion
  of the spring.</span> </p><p><span m=''673000''>I''m doing this because your problem
  set, problems three and</span> <span m=''677000''>four, ask you to look at a little
  computer visual which</span> <span m=''681000''>illustrates a lot of things. And,
  I didn''t see how it would</span> <span m=''686000''>make, you can do it without
  this interpretation of</span> <span m=''690000''>spring-mass-dashpot, --</span>
  <span m=''693000''>-- but, I think thinking of it of these constants as,</span>
  <span m=''697000''>this is the damping constant, and this is the spring,</span>
  <span m=''701000''>the constant which represents the force being exerted by the</span>
  <span m=''706000''>spring, the spring constant, as it''s called,</span> <span m=''710000''>makes
  it much more vivid. So, you will note is that those</span> <span m=''714000''>problems
  are labeled Friday or Monday.</span> </p><p><span m=''717000''>Make it Friday. You
  can do them after today if</span> <span m=''721000''>you have the vaguest idea of
  what I''m talking about.</span> </p><p><span m=''727000''>If not, go back and repeat
  8.01.</span> </p><p><span m=''730000''>So, all this was just an example, a typical
  model.</span> </p><p><span m=''736000''>But, by far, the most important simple</span>
  <span m=''740000''>model. Okay, now what I''d like to talk</span> <span m=''745000''>about
  is the solution. What is it I have to do to</span> <span m=''750000''>solve the
  equation? So, to solve the equation that</span> <span m=''757000''>I outlined in
  orange on the board, the ODE,</span> <span m=''761000''>our task is to find two
  solutions.</span> </p><p><span m=''764000''>Now, don''t make it too trivial. There
  is a condition.</span> </p><p><span m=''769000''>The solution should be independent.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''773000''>All that means is that y2 should not be a constant</span>
  <span m=''778000''>multiple of y1. I mean, if you got y1,</span> <span m=''782000''>then
  two times y1 is not an acceptable value for this</span> <span m=''786000''>because,
  as you can see, you really only got one there.</span> </p><p><span m=''790000''>You''re
  not going to be able to make up a two parameter family.</span> </p><p><span m=''795000''>So,
  the solutions have to be independent, which means,</span> <span m=''799000''>to
  repeat, that neither should be a constant multiple of the</span> <span m=''804000''>other.
  They should look different.</span> </p><p><span m=''806000''>That''s an adequate
  explanation. Okay, now, what''s the basic</span> <span m=''812000''>method to finding
  those solutions?</span> </p><p><span m=''814000''>Well, that''s what we''re going
  to use all term long,</span> <span m=''818000''>essentially, studying equations
  of this</span> <span m=''821000''>type, even systems of this type, with constant
  coefficients.</span> </p><p><span m=''826000''>The basic method is to try y equals
  an exponential.</span> </p><p><span m=''830000''>Now, the only way you can fiddle
  with an exponential is in</span> <span m=''834000''>the constant that you put up
  on top.</span> </p><p><span m=''837000''>So, I''m going to try y equals e to the
  rt.</span> </p><p><span m=''843000''>Notice you can''t tell from that what I''m
  using as the</span> <span m=''848000''>independent variable. But, this tells you
  I''m using</span> <span m=''853000''>t. And, I''m switching back to</span> <span
  m=''856000''>using t as the dependent variable.</span> </p><p><span m=''859000''>So,
  T is the independent variable.</span> </p><p><span m=''862000''>Why do I do that?
  The answer is because somebody</span> <span m=''867000''>thought of doing it, probably
  Euler,</span> <span m=''871000''>and it''s been a tradition that''s handed down
  for the last</span> <span m=''876000''>300 or 400 years. Some things we just know.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''882000''>All right, so if I do that, as you learned from the exam,</span>
  <span m=''886000''>it''s very easy to differentiate exponentials.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''890000''>That''s why people love them. It''s also very easy to</span> <span
  m=''894000''>integrate exponentials. And, half of you integrated</span> <span m=''898000''>instead
  of differentiating. So, we will try this and see if</span> <span m=''903000''>we
  can pick r so that it''s a solution.</span> </p><p><span m=''907000''>Okay, well,
  I will plug in, then.</span> </p><p><span m=''909000''>Substitute, in other words,
  and what do we get?</span> </p><p><span m=''912000''>Well, for y double prime, I
  get r squared e to the rt.</span> </p><p><span m=''916000''>That''s y double prime</span>
  <span m=''919000''>because each time you differentiate it,</span> <span m=''922000''>you
  put an extra power of r out in front.</span> </p><p><span m=''925000''>But otherwise,
  do nothing.</span> </p><p><span m=''927000''>The next term will be r times, sorry,
  I forgot the constant.</span> </p><p><span m=''933000''>Capital A times r e to the
  rt,</span> <span m=''936000''>and then there''s the last term, B times y itself,</span>
  <span m=''939000''>which is B e to the rt.</span> </p><p><span m=''941000''>And,
  that''s supposed to be equal to zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''944000''>So, I have
  to choose r so that this becomes equal to zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''948000''>Now,
  you see, the e to the rt</span> <span m=''951000''>occurs as a factor in every term,
  and the e to the rt</span> <span m=''954000''>is never zero. And therefore,</span>
  <span m=''957000''>you can divide it out because it''s always a positive number,</span>
  <span m=''961000''>regardless of the value of t. So, I can cancel out from each</span>
  <span m=''967000''>term. And, what I''m left with is the</span> <span m=''970000''>equation
  r squared plus ar plus b equals zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''976000''>We are trying
  to find values of</span> <span m=''979000''>r that satisfy that equation. And that,
  dear hearts,</span> <span m=''984000''>is why you learn to solve quadratic equations
  in high</span> <span m=''989000''>school, in order that in this moment, you would
  be now ready</span> <span m=''994000''>to find how spring-mass systems behave when
  they are damped.</span> </p><p><span m=''1001000''>This is called the characteristic
  equation.</span> </p><p><span m=''1005000''>The characteristic equation of the ODE,
  or of the system of the</span> <span m=''1012000''>spring mass system, which it''s
  modeling,</span> <span m=''1017000''>the characteristic equation of the system,
  okay?</span> </p><p><span m=''1022000''>Okay, now, we solve it, but now, from high
  school you</span> <span m=''1028000''>know there are several cases. And, each of
  those cases</span> <span m=''1034000''>corresponds to a different behavior.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1037000''>And, the cases depend upon what the roots look like.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1042000''>The possibilities are the roots could be real,</span>
  <span m=''1045000''>and distinct. That''s the easiest case to</span> <span m=''1049000''>handle.
  The roots might be a pair of</span> <span m=''1051000''>complex conjugate numbers.
  That''s harder to handle,</span> <span m=''1056000''>but we are ready to do it.
  And, the third case,</span> <span m=''1060000''>which is the one most in your problem
  set is the most</span> <span m=''1065000''>puzzling: when the roots are real, and
  equal.</span> </p><p><span m=''1068000''>And, I''m going to talk about those three
  cases in that order.</span> </p><p><span m=''1073000''>So, the first case is the
  roots are real and unequal.</span> </p><p><span m=''1077000''>If I tell you they
  are unequal, and I will put down real to</span> <span m=''1082000''>make that clear.
  Well, that is by far the</span> <span m=''1087000''>simplest case because immediately,
  one sees we have</span> <span m=''1091000''>two roots. They are different,</span>
  <span m=''1093000''>and therefore, we get our two solutions</span> <span m=''1097000''>immediately.
  So, the solutions are,</span> <span m=''1099000''>the general solution to the equation,
  I write down without</span> <span m=''1104000''>further ado as y equals c1 e to
  the r1 t plus c2 e to the r2 t.</span> </p><p><span m=''1114000''>There''s our solution.
  Now, because that was so easy,</span> <span m=''1118000''>and we didn''t have to
  do any work, I''d like to extend this</span> <span m=''1122000''>case a little bit
  by using it as an example of how you put in the</span> <span m=''1128000''>initial
  conditions, how to put in the c.</span> </p><p><span m=''1131000''>So, let me work
  a specific numerical example,</span> <span m=''1134000''>since we are not going
  to try to do this theoretically until</span> <span m=''1139000''>next Wednesday.
  Let''s just do a numerical</span> <span m=''1144000''>example. So, suppose I take
  the</span> <span m=''1147000''>constants to be the damping constant to be a four,</span>
  <span m=''1151000''>and the spring constant, I''ll take the mass to be one,</span>
  <span m=''1156000''>and the spring constant to be three.</span> </p><p><span m=''1159000''>So,
  there''s more damping here, damping force here.</span> </p><p><span m=''1164000''>You
  can''t really talk that way since the units are different.</span> </p><p><span m=''1171000''>But,
  this number is bigger than that one.</span> </p><p><span m=''1173000''>That seems
  clear, at any rate.</span> </p><p><span m=''1175000''>Okay, now, what was the characteristic
  equation?</span> </p><p><span m=''1179000''>Look, now watch. Please do what I do.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1181000''>I''ve found in the past, even by the middle of the term,</span>
  <span m=''1185000''>there are still students who feel that they must substitute
  y</span> <span m=''1190000''>equals e to the rt, and go through that whole</span>
  <span m=''1193000''>little derivation to find that you don''t do that.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1197000''>It''s a waste of time. I did it that you might not</span> <span m=''1202000''>ever
  have to do it again. Immediately write down the</span> <span m=''1206000''>characteristic
  equation. That''s not very hard.</span> </p><p><span m=''1210000''>r squared plus
  4r plus three equals zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''1214000''>And, if you can write
  down its</span> <span m=''1217000''>roots immediately, splendid.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1220000''>But, let''s not assume that level of competence.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1223000''>So, it''s r plus three times r plus one equals zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1229000''>Okay, you factor it.</span> </p><p><span m=''1233000''>This being
  18.03, a lot of the times the roots</span> <span m=''1236000''>will be integers
  when they are not, God forbid,</span> <span m=''1239000''>you will have to use the
  quadratic formula.</span> </p><p><span m=''1242000''>But here, the roots were integers.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1244000''>It is, after all, only the first example.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1247000''>So, the solution, the general solution is y</span> <span m=''1250000''>equals
  c1 e to the negative, notice the root is minus three</span> <span m=''1254000''>and
  minus one, minus 3t plus c2 e to the</span> <span m=''1256000''>negative t.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1261000''>Now, suppose it''s an initial value problem.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1264000''>So, I gave you an initial condition.</span> </p><p><span m=''1266000''>Suppose
  the initial conditions were that y of zero were one.</span> </p><p><span m=''1271000''>So,
  at the start,</span> <span m=''1273000''>the mass has been moved over to the position,</span>
  <span m=''1276000''>one, here. Well, we expected it,</span> <span m=''1278000''>then,
  to start doing that. But, this is fairly heavily</span> <span m=''1282000''>damped.
  This is heavily damped.</span> </p><p><span m=''1285000''>I''m going to assume that
  the mass starts at rest.</span> </p><p><span m=''1290000''>So, the spring is distended.
  The masses over here.</span> </p><p><span m=''1293000''>But, there''s no motion
  at times zero this way or that way.</span> </p><p><span m=''1297000''>In other words,
  I''m not pushing it.</span> </p><p><span m=''1300000''>I''m just releasing it and
  letting it do its thing after</span> <span m=''1304000''>that. Okay, so y prime
  of zero,</span> <span m=''1306000''>I''ll assume, is zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''1309000''>So,
  it starts at rest, but in the extended position,</span> <span m=''1313000''>one
  unit to the right of the equilibrium position.</span> </p><p><span m=''1316000''>Now,
  all you have to do is use these two conditions.</span> </p><p><span m=''1322000''>Notice
  I have to have two conditions because there are two</span> <span m=''1326000''>constants
  I have to find the value of.</span> </p><p><span m=''1329000''>All right, so, let''s
  substitute,</span> <span m=''1331000''>well, we''re going to have to calculate the
  derivative.</span> </p><p><span m=''1335000''>So, why don''t we do that right away?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1338000''>So, this is minus three c1 e to the minus 3t minus c2
  e to the</span> <span m=''1342000''>negative t.</span> </p><p><span m=''1347000''>And
  now, if I substitute in at zero, when t equals zero,</span> <span m=''1351000''>what
  do I get? Well, the first equation,</span> <span m=''1354000''>the left says that
  y of zero should be one.</span> </p><p><span m=''1358000''>And, the right says this
  is one.</span> </p><p><span m=''1361000''>So, it''s c1 plus c2.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1363000''>That''s the result of substituting t equals zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1367000''>How about substituting?</span> </p><p><span m=''1369000''>What should
  I substitute in the second equation?</span> </p><p><span m=''1373000''>Well, y prime
  of zero is zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''1376000''>So, if the second equation, when
  I put in t equals zero,</span> <span m=''1381000''>the left side is zero according
  to that initial value,</span> <span m=''1385000''>and the right side is negative
  three c1 minus c2.</span> </p><p><span m=''1392000''>You see what you end up with,
  therefore, is a pair of</span> <span m=''1395000''>simultaneous linear equations.
  And, this is why you learn to</span> <span m=''1399000''>study linear set of pairs
  of simultaneous linear equations in</span> <span m=''1404000''>high school. These
  are among the most</span> <span m=''1406000''>important. Solving problems of this
  type</span> <span m=''1409000''>are among the most important applications of that
  kind of</span> <span m=''1413000''>algebra, and this kind of algebra.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1417000''>All right, what''s the answer finally?</span> </p><p><span m=''1420000''>Well,
  if I add the two of them, I get minus 2c1 equals one.</span> </p><p><span m=''1425000''>So,
  c1 is equal to minus one half.</span> </p><p><span m=''1429000''>And, if c1 is minus
  a half,</span> <span m=''1434000''>then c2 is minus 3c1.</span> </p><p><span m=''1437000''>So,
  c2 is three halves.</span> </p><p><span m=''1450000''>The final question is, what
  does that look like as a</span> <span m=''1453000''>solution? Well, in general,</span>
  <span m=''1454000''>these combinations of two exponentials aren''t very easy to</span>
  <span m=''1457000''>plot by yourself. That''s one of the reasons you</span> <span
  m=''1460000''>are being given this little visual which plots them for you.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1464000''>All you have to do is, as you''ll see,</span> <span m=''1466000''>set
  the damping constant, set the constants,</span> <span m=''1468000''>set the initial
  conditions, and by magic,</span> <span m=''1471000''>the curve appears on the screen.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1474000''>And, if you change either of the constants,</span> <span
  m=''1480000''>the curve will change nicely right along with it.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1488000''>So, the solution is y equals minus one half e to the minus 3t</span>
  <span m=''1497000''>plus three halves e to the negative t.</span> </p><p><span m=''1506000''>How
  does it look?</span> </p><p><span m=''1511000''>Well, I don''t expect you to be
  able to plot that by yourself,</span> <span m=''1516000''>but you can at least get
  started.</span> </p><p><span m=''1519000''>It does have to satisfy the initial conditions.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1523000''>That means it should start at one, and its starting slope
  is</span> <span m=''1528000''>zero. So, it starts like that.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1532000''>These are both declining exponentials.</span> </p><p><span m=''1535000''>This
  declines very rapidly, this somewhat more slowly.</span> </p><p><span m=''1540000''>It
  does something like that. If this term were a lot,</span> <span m=''1544000''>lot
  more negative, I mean, that''s the way that</span> <span m=''1549000''>particular
  solution looks. How might other solutions look?</span> </p><p><span m=''1554000''>I''ll
  draw a few other possibilities.</span> </p><p><span m=''1557000''>If the initial
  term, if, for example,</span> <span m=''1560000''>the initial slope were quite negative,
  well,</span> <span m=''1564000''>that would have start like this.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1569000''>Now, just your experience of physics, or of the real world</span>
  <span m=''1572000''>suggests that if I give, if I start the thing at one,</span>
  <span m=''1575000''>but give it a strongly negative push, it''s going to go beyond</span>
  <span m=''1579000''>the equilibrium position, and then come back again.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1582000''>But, because the damping is big, it''s not going to be able</span>
  <span m=''1586000''>to get through that. The equilibrium position,</span> <span
  m=''1589000''>a second time, is going to look something like</span> <span m=''1591000''>that.
  Or, if I push it in that</span> <span m=''1594000''>direction, the positive direction,
  that it starts off</span> <span m=''1597000''>with a positive slope. But it loses
  its energy because</span> <span m=''1601000''>the spring is pulling it. It comes
  and does something</span> <span m=''1604000''>like that. So, in other words,</span>
  <span m=''1606000''>it might go down. Cut across the equilibrium</span> <span m=''1609000''>position,
  come back again, it do that?</span> </p><p><span m=''1612000''>No, that it cannot
  do. I was considering giving you a</span> <span m=''1615000''>problem to prove that,
  but I got tired of making out</span> <span m=''1618000''>the problems set, and decided
  I tortured you</span> <span m=''1621000''>enough already, as you will see.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1625000''>So, anyway, these are different possibilities for the
  way that</span> <span m=''1631000''>can look. This case, where it just</span> <span
  m=''1634000''>returns in the long run is called the over-damped case,</span> <span
  m=''1640000''>over-damped. Now, there is another case</span> <span m=''1644000''>where
  the thing oscillates back and forth.</span> </p><p><span m=''1650000''>We would
  expect to get that case if the damping is very</span> <span m=''1653000''>little
  or nonexistent. Then, there''s very little</span> <span m=''1657000''>preventing
  the mass from doing that, although we do expect if</span> <span m=''1661000''>there''s
  any damping at all, we expect it ultimately to get</span> <span m=''1665000''>nearer
  and nearer to the equilibrium position.</span> </p><p><span m=''1668000''>Mathematically,
  what does that correspond to?</span> </p><p><span m=''1671000''>Well, that''s going
  to correspond to case two,</span> <span m=''1675000''>where the roots are complex.
  The roots are complex,</span> <span m=''1679000''>and this is why, let''s call the
  roots,</span> <span m=''1683000''>in that case we know that the roots are of the
  form a plus or</span> <span m=''1688000''>minus bi. There are two roots,</span>
  <span m=''1690000''>and they are a complex conjugate.</span> </p><p><span m=''1693000''>All
  right, let''s take one of them.</span> </p><p><span m=''1696000''>What does a correspond
  to in terms of the exponential?</span> </p><p><span m=''1700000''>Well, remember,
  the function of the r was,</span> <span m=''1704000''>it''s this r when we tried
  our exponential solution.</span> </p><p><span m=''1710000''>So, what we formally,
  this means we get a complex</span> <span m=''1714000''>solution. The complex solution
  y equals e</span> <span m=''1718000''>to this, let''s use one of them, let''s say,
  (a plus bi) times t.</span> </p><p><span m=''1723000''>The question is,</span> <span
  m=''1727000''>what do we do that? We are not really interested,</span> <span m=''1731000''>I
  don''t know what a complex solution to that thing means.</span> </p><p><span m=''1736000''>It
  doesn''t have any meaning. What I want to know is how y</span> <span m=''1741000''>behaves
  or how x behaves in that picture.</span> </p><p><span m=''1747000''>And, that better
  be a real function because otherwise I</span> <span m=''1750000''>don''t know what
  to do with it. So, we are looking for two real</span> <span m=''1754000''>functions,
  the y1 and the y2. But, in fact,</span> <span m=''1757000''>what we''ve got is one
  complex function.</span> </p><p><span m=''1760000''>All right, now, a theorem to
  the rescue:</span> <span m=''1762000''>this, I''m not going to save for Wednesday
  because it''s so</span> <span m=''1766000''>simple. So, the theorem is that if you</span>
  <span m=''1770000''>have a complex solution, u plus iv, so each of these is</span>
  <span m=''1776000''>a function of time, u plus iv is the complex</span> <span m=''1780000''>solution
  to a real differential equation with constant</span> <span m=''1785000''>coefficients.
  Well, it doesn''t have to have</span> <span m=''1789000''>constant coefficients.
  It has to be linear.</span> </p><p><span m=''1793000''>Let me just write it out
  to y double prime plus A y prime plus</span> <span m=''1799000''>B y equals zero.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1804000''>Suppose you got a complex solution to that equation.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1808000''>These are understood to be real numbers.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1811000''>They are the damping constant and the spring constant.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1815000''>Then, the conclusion is that u and v are real solutions.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1820000''>In other words, having found a complex</span> <span m=''1823000''>solution,
  all you have to do is take its real and imaginary</span> <span m=''1828000''>parts,
  and voila, you''ve got your two solutions</span> <span m=''1831000''>you were looking
  for for the original equation.</span> </p><p><span m=''1837000''>Now, that might
  seem like magic, but it''s easy.</span> </p><p><span m=''1839000''>It''s so easy
  it''s the sort of theorem I could spend one minute</span> <span m=''1843000''>proving
  for you now. What''s the reason for it?</span> </p><p><span m=''1846000''>Well,
  the main thing I want you to get out of this argument is</span> <span m=''1850000''>to
  see that it absolutely depends upon these coefficients</span> <span m=''1854000''>being
  real. You have to have a real</span> <span m=''1856000''>differential equation for
  this to be true.</span> </p><p><span m=''1859000''>Otherwise, it''s certainly not.
  So, the proof is,</span> <span m=''1863000''>what does it mean to be a solution?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1866000''>It means when you plug in A (u plus iv) plus,</span>
  <span m=''1870000''>prime, plus B times u plus iv,</span> <span m=''1874000''>what
  am I supposed to get?</span> </p><p><span m=''1877000''>Zero. Well, now, separate
  these into</span> <span m=''1880000''>the real and imaginary parts. What does it
  say?</span> </p><p><span m=''1884000''>It says u double prime plus A u prime plus
  B u,</span> <span m=''1889000''>that''s the real part of this expression when I
  expand it</span> <span m=''1895000''>out. And, I''ve got an imaginary</span> <span
  m=''1899000''>part, too, which all have the coefficient i.</span> </p><p><span m=''1903000''>So,
  from here, I get v double prime plus i</span> <span m=''1906000''>times A v prime
  plus i times B v.</span> </p><p><span m=''1911000''>So, this is the imaginary part.
  Now, here I have something with</span> <span m=''1917000''>a real part plus the
  imaginary part, i, times the imaginary</span> <span m=''1922000''>part is zero.
  Well, the only way that can</span> <span m=''1925000''>happen is if the real part
  is zero, and the imaginary part is</span> <span m=''1931000''>separately zero. So,
  the conclusion is that</span> <span m=''1935000''>therefore this part must be zero,
  and therefore this part</span> <span m=''1939000''>must be zero because the two
  of them together make the complex</span> <span m=''1943000''>number zero plus zero
  i. Now, what does it mean for the</span> <span m=''1947000''>real part to be zero?
  It means that u is a solution.</span> </p><p><span m=''1951000''>This, the imaginary
  part zero means v is a solution,</span> <span m=''1954000''>and therefore, just
  what I said.</span> </p><p><span m=''1956000''>u and v are solutions to the real
  equation.</span> </p><p><span m=''1959000''>Where did I use the fact that A and
  B were real numbers and not</span> <span m=''1964000''>complex numbers? In knowing
  that this is the</span> <span m=''1967000''>real part, I had to know that A was
  a real number.</span> </p><p><span m=''1971000''>If A were something like one plus
  i,</span> <span m=''1974000''>I''d be screwed, I mean, because then I couldn''t</span>
  <span m=''1977000''>say that this was the real part anymore.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1982000''>So, saying that''s the real part, and this is the imaginary</span>
  <span m=''1987000''>part, I was using the fact that these two numbers,</span> <span
  m=''1992000''>constants, were real constants: very important.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1997000''>So, what is the case two solution?</span> </p><p><span m=''2000000''>Well,
  what are the real and imaginary parts</span> <span m=''2006000''>of (a plus b i)
  t? Well, y equals e to the at +</span> <span m=''2011000''>ibt. Okay, you''ve had
  experience.</span> </p><p><span m=''2017000''>You know how to do this now. That''s
  e to the at</span> <span m=''2022000''>times, well, the real part is, well, let''s
  write it this way.</span> </p><p><span m=''2027000''>The real part is e to the at
  times cosine b t.</span> </p><p><span m=''2031000''>Notice how the a and b enter</span>
  <span m=''2034000''>into the expression. That''s the real part.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2038000''>And, the imaginary part is e to the at times the sine of bt.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2043000''>And therefore,</span> <span m=''2047000''>the solution,
  both of these must,</span> <span m=''2050000''>therefore, be solutions to the equation.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2053000''>And therefore, the general solution to the ODE</span>
  <span m=''2058000''>is y equals, now, you''ve got to put in the</span> <span m=''2061000''>arbitrary
  constants. It''s a nice thing to do to</span> <span m=''2066000''>factor out the
  e to the at.</span> </p><p><span m=''2069000''>It makes it look a little better.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2072000''>And so, the constants are c1 cosine bt and c2 sine bt.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2079000''>Yeah, but what does that look like?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2081000''>Well, you know that too. This is an exponential,</span> <span m=''2085000''>which
  controls the amplitude. But this guy,</span> <span m=''2089000''>which is a combination
  of two sinusoidal oscillations with</span> <span m=''2093000''>different amplitudes,
  but with the same frequency,</span> <span m=''2097000''>the b''s are the same in
  both of them, and therefore,</span> <span m=''2101000''>this is, itself, a purely
  sinusoidal</span> <span m=''2104000''>oscillation. So, in other words,</span> <span
  m=''2109000''>I don''t have room to write it, but it''s equal to,</span> <span m=''2115000''>you
  know. It''s a good example of where</span> <span m=''2120000''>you''d use that trigonometric
  identity I spent time on before</span> <span m=''2127000''>the exam. Okay, let''s
  work a quick</span> <span m=''2131000''>example just to see how this works out.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2133000''>Well, let''s get rid of this. Okay, let''s now make the</span>
  <span m=''2136000''>damping, since this is showing oscillations,</span> <span m=''2139000''>it
  must correspond to the case where the damping is less strong</span> <span m=''2142000''>compared
  with the spring constant.</span> </p><p><span m=''2144000''>So, the theorem is that
  if you have a complex solution,</span> <span m=''2147000''>u plus iv, so each of
  these is a function of time,</span> <span m=''2150000''>u plus iv is the complex
  solution to a real</span> <span m=''2153000''>differential equation with constant
  coefficients.</span> </p><p><span m=''2156000''>A stiff spring, one that pulls with
  hard force</span> <span m=''2158000''>is going to make that thing go back and forth,</span>
  <span m=''2161000''>particularly at the dipping is weak.</span> </p><p><span m=''2165000''>So,
  let''s use almost the same equation as I''ve just concealed.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2169000''>But, do you remember a used four here?</span> </p><p><span m=''2172000''>Okay,
  before we used three and we got the solution to look like</span> <span m=''2177000''>that.
  Now, we will give it a little</span> <span m=''2179000''>more energy by putting
  some moxie in the springs.</span> </p><p><span m=''2183000''>So now, the spring
  is pulling a little harder,</span> <span m=''2186000''>bigger force, a stiffer spring.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2190000''>Okay, the characteristic equation is now going to be
  r</span> <span m=''2195000''>squared plus 4r plus five is equal to zero.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2200000''>And therefore, if I solve for r,</span> <span m=''2203000''>I''m
  not going to bother trying to factor this because I</span> <span m=''2209000''>prepared
  for this lecture, and I know, quadratic formula</span> <span m=''2214000''>time,
  minus four plus or minus the square root of b squared,</span> <span m=''2220000''>16,
  minus four times five, 16 minus 20 is negative four</span> <span m=''2225000''>all
  over two. And therefore,</span> <span m=''2229000''>that makes negative two plus
  or minus, this makes,</span> <span m=''2233000''>simply, i. 2i divided by two,</span>
  <span m=''2235000''>which is i. So, the exponential solution is</span> <span m=''2239000''>e
  to the negative two, you don''t have to write this</span> <span m=''2243000''>in.
  You can get the thing directly.</span> </p><p><span m=''2246000''>t, let''s use
  the one with the plus sign, and that''s going to</span> <span m=''2251000''>give,
  as the real solutions, e to the negative two t times</span> <span m=''2256000''>cosine
  t, and e to the negative 2t times</span> <span m=''2261000''>the sine of t.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2266000''>And therefore, the solution is going to be y</span> <span
  m=''2271000''>equals e to the negative 2t times</span> <span m=''2278000''>(c1 cosine
  t plus c2 sine t).</span> </p><p><span m=''2284000''>If you want to put initial
  conditions, you can put them in</span> <span m=''2288000''>the same way I did them
  before. Suppose we use the same initial</span> <span m=''2292000''>conditions: y
  of zero equals one,</span> <span m=''2295000''>and y prime of zero equals one, equals
  zero,</span> <span m=''2299000''>let''s say, wait, blah, blah, blah,</span> <span
  m=''2302000''>zero, yeah. Okay, I''d like to take time to</span> <span m=''2304000''>actually
  do the calculation, but there''s nothing new in it.</span> </p><p><span m=''2310000''>I''d
  have to take, calculate the derivative here,</span> <span m=''2315000''>and then
  I would substitute in, solve equations,</span> <span m=''2320000''>and when you
  do all that, just as before,</span> <span m=''2324000''>the answer that you get
  is y equals e to the negative 2t,</span> <span m=''2330000''>so, choose the constants
  c1 and c2</span> <span m=''2335000''>by solving linear equations, and the answer
  is cosine t,</span> <span m=''2341000''>so, c1 turns out to be one, and c2 turns
  out to be two,</span> <span m=''2347000''>I hope. Okay, I want to know,</span> <span
  m=''2351000''>but what does that look like? Well, use that trigonometric</span>
  <span m=''2355000''>identity. The e to the negative 2t</span> <span m=''2358000''>is
  just a real factor which is going to</span> <span m=''2361000''>reproduce itself.
  The question is,</span> <span m=''2364000''>what is cosine t plus 2 sine t look
  like?</span> </p><p><span m=''2368000''>What''s its amplitude as a pure oscillation?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2371000''>It''s the square root of one plus two squared.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2375000''>Remember, it depends on looking</span> <span m=''2379000''>at
  that little triangle, which is one,</span> <span m=''2381000''>two, this is a different
  scale than that.</span> </p><p><span m=''2384000''>And here is the square root of
  five, right?</span> </p><p><span m=''2387000''>And, here is phi, the phase lag.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2390000''>So, it''s equal to the square root of five.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2393000''>So, it''s the square root of five times e to</span> <span m=''2397000''>the
  negative 2t, and the stuff inside is the</span> <span m=''2400000''>cosine of, the
  frequency is one. Circular frequency is one,</span> <span m=''2406000''>so it''s
  t minus phi, where phi is this angle.</span> </p><p><span m=''2410000''>How big
  is that, one and two?</span> </p><p><span m=''2413000''>Well, if this were the square
  root of three,</span> <span m=''2416000''>which is a little less than two, it would
  be 60 infinity.</span> </p><p><span m=''2420000''>So, this must be 70 infinity.
  So, phi is 70 infinity plus or minus</span> <span m=''2424000''>five, let''s say.
  So, it looks like a slightly</span> <span m=''2429000''>delayed cosine curve, but
  the amplitude is falling.</span> </p><p><span m=''2432000''>So, it has to start.
  So, if I draw it,</span> <span m=''2435000''>here''s one, here is, let''s say, the
  square root of</span> <span m=''2439000''>five up about here. Then, the square root
  of five</span> <span m=''2443000''>times e to the negative 2t looks maybe</span>
  <span m=''2447000''>something like this. So, that''s square root of five</span>
  <span m=''2451000''>e to the negative 2t.</span> </p><p><span m=''2454000''>This
  is cosine t, but shoved over by not quite pi</span> <span m=''2459000''>over two.
  It starts at one,</span> <span m=''2462000''>and with the slope zero. So, the solution
  starts like</span> <span m=''2466000''>this. It has to be guided in its</span> <span
  m=''2468000''>amplitude by this function out there, and in between it''s the</span>
  <span m=''2473000''>cosine curve. But it''s moved over.</span> </p><p><span m=''2475000''>So,
  if this is pi over two, the first time it crosses,</span> <span m=''2480000''>it''s
  72 infinity to the right of that. So, if this is pi</span> <span m=''2484000''>over
  two, it''s pi over two plus 70 infinity where it crosses.</span> </p><p><span m=''2487000''>So,
  it must be doing something like this.</span> </p><p><span m=''2492000''>And now,
  on the other side, it''s got to stay within the</span> <span m=''2496000''>same
  amplitude. So, it must be doing something</span> <span m=''2500000''>like this.
  Okay, that gets us to,</span> <span m=''2503000''>if this is the under-damped case,
  because if you''re trying</span> <span m=''2508000''>to do this with a swinging
  door, it means the door''s going to be</span> <span m=''2514000''>swinging back
  and forth. Or, our little mass now hidden,</span> <span m=''2519000''>but you could
  see it behind that board, is going to be doing</span> <span m=''2524000''>this.
  But, it never stops.</span> </p><p><span m=''2527000''>It never stops. It doesn''t
  realize,</span> <span m=''2531000''>but not in theoretical life. So, this is the
  under-damped.</span> </p><p><span m=''2536000''>All right, so it''s like Goldilocks
  and the Three Bears.</span> </p><p><span m=''2541000''>That''s too hot, and this
  is too cold.</span> </p><p><span m=''2545000''>What is the thing which is just right?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2550000''>Well, that''s the thing you''re going to study on the
  problem</span> <span m=''2557000''>set. So, just right is called</span> <span m=''2560000''>critically
  damped. It''s what people aim for in</span> <span m=''2566000''>trying to damp motion
  that they don''t want.</span> </p><p><span m=''2571000''>Now, what''s critically
  damped? It must be the case just in</span> <span m=''2578000''>between these two.
  Neither complex,</span> <span m=''2583000''>nor the roots different. It''s the case
  of two equal</span> <span m=''2588000''>roots. So, r squared plus Ar plus B</span>
  <span m=''2591000''>equals zero has two equal roots.</span> </p><p><span m=''2597000''>Now,
  that''s a very special equation.</span> </p><p><span m=''2600000''>Suppose we call
  the root, since all of these,</span> <span m=''2604000''>notice these roots in this
  physical case.</span> </p><p><span m=''2610000''>The roots always turn out to be
  negative numbers,</span> <span m=''2613000''>or have a negative real part. I''m
  going to call the root a.</span> </p><p><span m=''2617000''>So, r equals negative
  a, the root.</span> </p><p><span m=''2620000''>a is understood to be a positive
  number.</span> </p><p><span m=''2623000''>I want that root to be really negative.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2625000''>Then, the equation looks like, the characteristic equation
  is</span> <span m=''2630000''>going to be r plus a, right, if the root is negative</span>
  <span m=''2633000''>a, squared because it''s a double root.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2637000''>And, that means the equation is of the form r squared plus two</span>
  <span m=''2641000''>times a r plus a squared equals zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''2647000''>In
  other words, the ODE looked like this.</span> </p><p><span m=''2650000''>The ODE
  looked like y double prime plus 2a y prime</span> <span m=''2655000''>plus, in other
  words,</span> <span m=''2658000''>the damping and the spring constant were related
  in this</span> <span m=''2662000''>special wake, that for a given value of the</span>
  <span m=''2666000''>spring constant, there was exactly one value of</span> <span
  m=''2670000''>the damping which produced this in between case.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2676000''>Now, what''s the problem connected with it?</span> </p><p><span m=''2679000''>Well,
  the problem, unfortunately,</span> <span m=''2682000''>is staring us in the face
  when we want to solve it.</span> </p><p><span m=''2686000''>The problem is that
  we have a solution, but it is y equals e</span> <span m=''2691000''>to the minus
  at. I don''t have another root to</span> <span m=''2696000''>get another solution
  with. And, the question is,</span> <span m=''2701000''>where do I get that other
  solution from?</span> </p><p><span m=''2704000''>Now, there are three ways to get
  it.</span> </p><p><span m=''2706000''>Well, there are four ways to get it.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2709000''>You look it up in Euler. That''s the fourth way.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2712000''>That''s the real way to do it. But, I''ve given you one
  way as</span> <span m=''2716000''>problem number one on the problem set.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2719000''>I''ve given you another way as problem number two on
  the</span> <span m=''2723000''>problem set. And, the third way you will</span> <span
  m=''2726000''>have to wait for about a week and a half.</span> </p><p><span m=''2728000''>And,
  I will give you a third way, too.</span> </p><p><span m=''2733000''>By that time,
  you won''t want to see any more</span> <span m=''2736000''>ways. But, I''d like
  to introduce you</span> <span m=''2739000''>to the way on the problem set. And,
  it is this,</span> <span m=''2743000''>that if you know one solution to an equation,</span>
  <span m=''2747000''>which looks like a linear equation, in fact,</span> <span m=''2751000''>the
  piece can be functions of t.</span> </p><p><span m=''2754000''>They don''t have
  to be constant, so I''ll use the books notation</span> <span m=''2759000''>with
  p''s and q''s. y prime plus q y equals zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''2765000''>If
  you know one solution, there''s an absolute,</span> <span m=''2768000''>ironclad
  guarantee, if you''ll know that it''s true</span> <span m=''2773000''>because I''m
  asking you to prove it for yourself.</span> </p><p><span m=''2777000''>There''s
  another of the form, having this as a factor,</span> <span m=''2781000''>one solution
  y one, let''s call it,</span> <span m=''2784000''>y equals y1 u is another solution.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2788000''>And, you will be able to find u, I swear.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2793000''>Now, let''s, in the remaining couple of minutes carry that out</span>
  <span m=''2797000''>just for this case because I want you to see how to arrange</span>
  <span m=''2801000''>the work nicely. And, I want you to arrange your</span> <span
  m=''2804000''>work when you do the problem sets in the same way.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2808000''>So, the way to do it is, the solution we know is e to</span> <span
  m=''2812000''>the minus at. So, we are going to look for a</span> <span m=''2816000''>solution
  to this differential equation.</span> </p><p><span m=''2820000''>That''s the differential
  equation.</span> </p><p><span m=''2822000''>And, the solution we are going to look
  for is of the form e to</span> <span m=''2828000''>the negative at times u.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2832000''>Now, you''re going to have to make calculation like this</span>
  <span m=''2837000''>several times in the course of the term.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2840000''>Do it this way. y prime equals,</span> <span m=''2843000''>differentiate,
  minus a e to the minus a t u</span> <span m=''2847000''>plus e to the minus a t
  u prime.</span> </p><p><span m=''2853000''>And then, differentiate again.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2857000''>The answer will be a squared.</span> </p><p><span m=''2859000''>You
  differentiate this: a squared e to the negative at</span> <span m=''2863000''>u.
  I''ll have to do this a little</span> <span m=''2867000''>fast, but the next term
  will be, okay, minus,</span> <span m=''2870000''>so this times u prime, and from
  this are you going to</span> <span m=''2873000''>get another minus. So, combining
  what you get from</span> <span m=''2877000''>here, and here, you''re going to get
  minus 2a e</span> <span m=''2880000''>to the minus a t u prime.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2885000''>And then, there is a final term, which comes from this,</span> <span
  m=''2888000''>e to the minus a t u double prime.</span> </p><p><span m=''2891000''>Two
  of these, because of a piece here and a</span> <span m=''2895000''>piece here combine
  to make that. And now, to plug into the</span> <span m=''2899000''>equation, you
  multiply this by one.</span> </p><p><span m=''2901000''>In other words, you don''t
  do anything to it.</span> </p><p><span m=''2904000''>You multiply this line by 2a,
  and you multiply that line by a</span> <span m=''2908000''>squared, and you add
  them.</span> </p><p><span m=''2912000''>On the left-hand side, I get zero.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2914000''>What do I get on the right? Notice how I''ve arrange
  the</span> <span m=''2919000''>work so it adds nicely. This has a squared times
  this,</span> <span m=''2923000''>plus 2a times that, plus one times that makes zero.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2927000''>2a times this plus one times this makes zero.</span>
