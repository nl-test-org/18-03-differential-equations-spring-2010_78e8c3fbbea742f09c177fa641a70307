transcript: "<p><span m='7000'>We are going to need a few facts about fundamental</span>\
  \ <span m='9000'>matrices, and I am worried that over the weekend this spring</span>\
  \ <span m='13000'>activities weekend you might have forgotten them.</span> <span\
  \ m='16000'>So I will just spend two or three minutes reviewing the most</span>\
  \ <span m='20000'>essential things that we are going to need later in the</span>\
  \ <span m='23000'>period. What we are talking about is,</span> <span m='25000'>I\
  \ will try to color code things so you will know what they are.</span> <span m='30000'>First\
  \ of all, the basic problem is to solve a</span> <span m='32000'>system of equations.\
  \ And I am going to make that a</span> <span m='36000'>two-by-two system, although\
  \ practically everything</span> <span m='39000'>I say today will also work for end-by-end\
  \ systems.</span> <span m='42000'>Your book tries to do it end-by-end, as usual,</span>\
  \ <span m='45000'>but I think it is easier to learn two-by-two first and</span>\
  \ <span m='48000'>generalize rather than to wade through the complications of</span>\
  \ <span m='52000'>end-by-end systems. So the problem is to solve it.</span> <span\
  \ m='57000'>And the method I used last time was to describe something called</span>\
  \ <span m='62000'>a fundamental matrix.</span> <span m='68000'>A fundamental matrix\
  \ for the system or for A,</span> <span m='72000'>whichever you want, remember what\
  \ that was.</span> <span m='77000'>That was a two-by-two matrix of functions of\
  \ t and whose columns</span> <span m='84000'>were two independent solutions, x1,\
  \ x2.</span> <span m='89000'>These were two independent solutions.</span> <span\
  \ m='92000'>In other words, neither was a constant multiple</span> <span m='97000'>of\
  \ the other. Now, I spent a fair amount of</span> <span m='101000'>time showing\
  \ you the two essential properties that a</span> <span m='106000'>fundamental matrix\
  \ had. We are going to need those</span> <span m='111000'>today, so let me remind\
  \ you the basic properties of X and the</span> <span m='117000'>properties by which\
  \ you could recognize one if you were given</span> <span m='123000'>one. First of\
  \ all,</span> <span m='126000'>the easy one, its determinant shall not be</span>\
  \ <span m='129000'>zero, is not zero for any t, for any value of the variable.</span>\
  \ <span m='134000'>That simply expresses the fact that its two columns are</span>\
  \ <span m='138000'>independent, linearly independent, not a multiple of</span> <span\
  \ m='142000'>each other. The other one was more bizarre,</span> <span m='146000'>so\
  \ I tried to call a little more attention to it.</span> <span m='151000'>It was\
  \ that the matrix satisfies a differential</span> <span m='154000'>equation of its\
  \ own, which looks almost the same,</span> <span m='158000'>except it's a matrix\
  \ differential equation.</span> <span m='161000'>It is not our column vectors which\
  \ are solutions but matrices</span> <span m='165000'>as a whole which are solutions.\
  \ In other words,</span> <span m='169000'>if you take that matrix and differentiate\
  \ every entry,</span> <span m='173000'>what you get is the same as A multiplied\
  \ by that matrix you</span> <span m='177000'>started with. This, remember,</span>\
  \ <span m='181000'>expressed the fact, it was just really formal when</span> <span\
  \ m='186000'>you analyzed what it was, but it expressed the fact that</span> <span\
  \ m='191000'>it says that the columns solved the system.</span> <span m='195000'>The\
  \ first thing says the columns are independent and the</span> <span m='200000'>second\
  \ says each column separately is a solution to the</span> <span m='205000'>system.\
  \ That is as far,</span> <span m='207000'>more or less. Then I went in another</span>\
  \ <span m='211000'>direction and we talked about variation of parameters.</span>\
  \ <span m='214000'>I am not going to come back to variation of parameters today.</span>\
  \ <span m='217000'>We are going in a different tack.</span> <span m='219000'>And\
  \ the tack we are going on is I want to first talk a little</span> <span m='223000'>more\
  \ about the fundamental matrix and then,</span> <span m='225000'>as I said, we will\
  \ talk about an entirely different method of</span> <span m='229000'>solving the\
  \ system, one which makes no mention of</span> <span m='232000'>eigenvalues or eigenvectors,\
  \ if you can believe that.</span> <span m='236000'>But, first, the one confusing\
  \ thing about the fundamental</span> <span m='240000'>matrix is that it is not unique.\
  \ I have carefully tried to avoid</span> <span m='245000'>talking about the fundamental\
  \ matrix because there is no \"the\"</span> <span m='249000'>fundamental matrix,\
  \ there is only \"a\" fundamental</span> <span m='253000'>matrix. Why is that?</span>\
  \ <span m='254000'>Well, because these two columns can be any two independent</span>\
  \ <span m='259000'>solutions. And there are an infinity of</span> <span m='262000'>ways\
  \ of picking independent solutions.</span> <span m='264000'>That means there is\
  \ an infinity of possible fundamental</span> <span m='268000'>matrices. Well, that\
  \ is disgusting,</span> <span m='273000'>but can we repair it a little bit?</span>\
  \ <span m='276000'>I mean maybe they are all derivable from each other in</span>\
  \ <span m='280000'>some simple way. And that is,</span> <span m='283000'>of course,\
  \ what is true. Now, as a prelude to doing</span> <span m='287000'>that, I would\
  \ like to show you what I wanted to show you on</span> <span m='292000'>Friday but,\
  \ again, I ran out of time,</span> <span m='295000'>how to write the general solution\
  \ --</span> <span m='305000'>-- to the system. The system I am talking about</span>\
  \ <span m='308000'>is that pink system. Well, of course,</span> <span m='310000'>the\
  \ standard na\u010Fve way of doing it is it's x equals,</span> <span m='313000'>the\
  \ general solution is an arbitrary constant times that</span> <span m='317000'>first\
  \ solution you found, plus c2, times another</span> <span m='320000'>arbitrary constant,\
  \ times the second solution you</span> <span m='324000'>found. Okay. Now, how would\
  \ you abbreviate that using the fundamental</span> <span m='328000'>matrix? Well,\
  \ I did something very</span> <span m='332000'>similar to this on Friday, except\
  \ these were called Vs.</span> <span m='338000'>It was part of the variation parameters\
  \ method,</span> <span m='342000'>but I promised not to use those words today so\
  \ I just said</span> <span m='348000'>nothing. Okay.</span> <span m='349000'>What\
  \ is the answer? It is x equals,</span> <span m='353000'>how do I write this using\
  \ the fundamental matrix,</span> <span m='358000'>x1, x2? Simple.</span> <span m='359000'>It\
  \ is capital X times the column vector whose entries are</span> <span m='365000'>c1\
  \ and c2. In other words,</span> <span m='369000'>it is x1, x2 times the column\
  \ vector c1, c2,</span> <span m='373000'>isn't it? Yeah.</span> <span m='375000'>Because\
  \ if you multiply this think top row,</span> <span m='379000'>top row, top row c1,\
  \ plus top row times c2,</span> <span m='383000'>that exactly gives you the top\
  \ row here.</span> <span m='387000'>And the same way the bottom row here, times\
  \ this vector,</span> <span m='393000'>gives you the bottom row of that.</span>\
  \ <span m='398000'>It is just another way of writing that,</span> <span m='400000'>but\
  \ it looks very efficient. Sometimes efficiency isn't a</span> <span m='404000'>good\
  \ thing, you have to watch out for it, but here it is good.</span> <span m='409000'>So,\
  \ this is the general solution written out using a</span> <span m='413000'>fundamental\
  \ matrix. And you cannot use less symbols</span> <span m='416000'>than that. There\
  \ is just no way.</span> <span m='420000'>But that gives us our answer to, what\
  \ do all fundamental</span> <span m='425000'>matrices look like?</span> <span m='438000'>Well,\
  \ they are two columns are solutions.</span> <span m='442000'>The answer is they\
  \ look like -- Now, the first column is an</span> <span m='448000'>arbitrary solution.\
  \ How do I write an arbitrary</span> <span m='451000'>solution? There is the general\
  \ solution.</span> <span m='455000'>I make it a particular one by giving a particular\
  \ value to</span> <span m='459000'>that column vector of arbitrary constants like\
  \ two,</span> <span m='463000'>three or minus one, pi or something like that.</span>\
  \ <span m='467000'>The first guy is a solution, and I have just shown you I can</span>\
  \ <span m='472000'>write such a solution like X, c1 with a column vector,</span>\
  \ <span m='476000'>a particular column vector of numbers.</span> <span m='481000'>This\
  \ is a solution because the green thing says it is.</span> <span m='484000'>And\
  \ side by side, we will write another one.</span> <span m='488000'>And now all I\
  \ have to do is, of course, there is supposed to</span> <span m='492000'>be a dependent.\
  \ We will worry about that in</span> <span m='495000'>just a moment. All I have\
  \ to do is make this</span> <span m='498000'>look better. Now, I told you last time,</span>\
  \ <span m='501000'>by the laws of matrix multiplication,</span> <span m='504000'>if\
  \ the first column is X c1 and the second column is X c2,</span> <span m='508000'>using\
  \ matrix multiplication that is the same as writing it</span> <span m='512000'>this\
  \ way. This square matrix times the</span> <span m='517000'>matrix whose entries\
  \ are the first column vector and the</span> <span m='522000'>second column vector.\
  \ Now, I am going to call this C.</span> <span m='527000'>It is a square matrix\
  \ of constants.</span> <span m='530000'>It is a two-by-two matrix of constants.</span>\
  \ <span m='534000'>And so, the final way of writing it is just what</span> <span\
  \ m='539000'>corresponds to that, X times C.</span> <span m='543000'>And so X is\
  \ a given fundamental matrix, this one,</span> <span m='547000'>that one, so the\
  \ most general fundamental matrix is then the</span> <span m='553000'>one you started\
  \ with, and multiply it by an arbitrary</span> <span m='559000'>square matrix of\
  \ constants, except you want to be sure that</span> <span m='565000'>the determinant\
  \ is not zero. Well, the determinant of this</span> <span m='571000'>guy won't be\
  \ zero, so all you have to do is make</span> <span m='574000'>sure that the determinant\
  \ of C isn't zero either.</span> <span m='578000'>In other words, the fundamental\
  \ matrix is not</span> <span m='581000'>unique, but once you found one all the other\
  \ ones are found by</span> <span m='586000'>multiplying it on the right by an arbitrary\
  \ square matrix of</span> <span m='591000'>constants, which is nonsingular, it has\
  \ determinant nonzero in</span> <span m='595000'>other words. Well, that was all\
  \ Friday.</span> <span m='600000'>That's Friday leaking over into Monday.</span>\
  \ <span m='603000'>And now we begin the true Monday.</span> <span m='615000'>Here\
  \ is the problem. Once again we have our</span> <span m='619000'>two-by-two system,\
  \ or end-by-end if you want to be</span> <span m='624000'>super general. There is\
  \ a system.</span> <span m='628000'>What do we have so far by way of solving it?</span>\
  \ <span m='634000'>Well, if your kid brother or sister when you go home said,</span>\
  \ <span m='638000'>a precocious kid, okay, tell me how to solve this</span> <span\
  \ m='641000'>thing, I think the only thing you will be able to say is well,</span>\
  \ <span m='645000'>you do this, you take the matrix and then</span> <span m='648000'>you\
  \ calculate something called eigenvalues and eigenvectors.</span> <span m='652000'>Do\
  \ you know what those are? I didn't think you did,</span> <span m='656000'>blah,\
  \ blah, blah, show how smart I am.</span> <span m='660000'>And you then explain\
  \ what the eigenvalues and eigenvectors</span> <span m='663000'>are. And then you\
  \ show how out of</span> <span m='665000'>those make up special solutions. And then\
  \ you take a combination</span> <span m='669000'>of that. In other words,</span>\
  \ <span m='671000'>it is algorithm. It is something you do,</span> <span m='673000'>a\
  \ process, a method. And when it is all done,</span> <span m='676000'>you have the\
  \ general solution. Now, that is fine for</span> <span m='679000'>calculating particular\
  \ problems with a definite model with</span> <span m='683000'>definite numbers in\
  \ it where you want a definite answer.</span> <span m='688000'>And, of course, a\
  \ lot of your work in</span> <span m='690000'>engineering and science classes is\
  \ that kind of work.</span> <span m='694000'>But the further you get on, well, when\
  \ you start reading</span> <span m='699000'>books, for example, or god forbid start\
  \ reading</span> <span m='702000'>papers in which people are telling you, you know,</span>\
  \ <span m='706000'>they are doing engineering or they are doing science,</span>\
  \ <span m='710000'>they don't want a method, what they want is a formula.</span>\
  \ <span m='714000'>In other words, the problem is to fill in the</span> <span m='717000'>blank\
  \ in the following. You are writing a paper,</span> <span m='722000'>and you just\
  \ set up some elaborate model and A is a</span> <span m='726000'>matrix derived\
  \ from that model in some way, represents bacteria</span> <span m='731000'>doing\
  \ something or bank accounts doing something,</span> <span m='735000'>I don't know.\
  \ And you say,</span> <span m='737000'>as is well-known, the solution is,</span>\
  \ <span m='740000'>of course, you only have letters here,</span> <span m='743000'>no\
  \ numbers. This is a general paper.</span> <span m='745000'>The solution is given\
  \ by the formula.</span> <span m='755000'>The only trouble is, we don't have a formula.</span>\
  \ <span m='758000'>All we have is a method. Now, people don't like that.</span>\
  \ <span m='762000'>What I am going to produce for you this period is a formula,</span>\
  \ <span m='767000'>and that formula does not require the calculation of any</span>\
  \ <span m='771000'>eigenvalues, eigenvectors, doesn't require any of that.</span>\
  \ <span m='775000'>It is, therefore, a very popular way to fill in</span> <span\
  \ m='779000'>to finish that sentence. Now the question is where is</span> <span\
  \ m='784000'>that formula going to come from? Well, we are,</span> <span m='788000'>for\
  \ the moment, clueless.</span> <span m='790000'>If you are clueless the place to\
  \ look always is do I know</span> <span m='794000'>anything about this sort of thing?</span>\
  \ <span m='797000'>I mean is there some special case of this problem I can solve</span>\
  \ <span m='802000'>or that I have solved in the past?</span> <span m='805000'>And\
  \ the answer to that is yes. You haven't solved it for a</span> <span m='811000'>two-by-two\
  \ matrix but you have solved it for a one-by-one</span> <span m='815000'>matrix.\
  \ A one-by-one matrix also goes</span> <span m='818000'>by the name of a constant.\
  \ It is just a thing.</span> <span m='821000'>It's a number. Just putting brackets\
  \ around it</span> <span m='825000'>doesn't conceal the fact that it is just a number.</span>\
  \ <span m='828000'>Let's look at what the solution is for a one-by-one matrix,</span>\
  \ <span m='833000'>a one-by-one case. If we are looking for a general</span> <span\
  \ m='837000'>solution for the end-by-end case, it must work for the</span> <span\
  \ m='841000'>one-by-one case also. That is a good reason for us</span> <span m='847000'>starting.\
  \ That looks like x,</span> <span m='850000'>doesn't it? A one-by-one case.</span>\
  \ <span m='860000'>Well, in that case, I am trying to solve the</span> <span m='863000'>system.\
  \ The system consists of a single</span> <span m='866000'>equation. That is the\
  \ way the system</span> <span m='869000'>looks. How do you solve that?</span> <span\
  \ m='873000'>Well, you were born knowing how to solve that.</span> <span m='877000'>Anyway,\
  \ you certainly didn't learn it in this course.</span> <span m='882000'>You separate\
  \ variables, blah, blah, blah,</span> <span m='886000'>and the solution is x equals,\
  \ the basic solution is e to the</span> <span m='892000'>at, and you multiply that\
  \ by an</span> <span m='896000'>arbitrary constant. Now, that is a formula for the</span>\
  \ <span m='902000'>solution. And it uses the parameter in</span> <span m='905000'>the\
  \ equation. I didn't have to know a special</span> <span m='909000'>number. I didn't\
  \ have to put a</span> <span m='911000'>particular number here to use that.</span>\
  \ <span m='914000'>Well, the answer is that the same idea, whatever the answer I</span>\
  \ <span m='920000'>give here has got to work in this case, too.</span> <span m='923000'>But\
  \ let's take a quick look as to why this works.</span> <span m='929000'>Of course,\
  \ you separate variables and use calculus.</span> <span m='932000'>I am going to\
  \ give you a slightly different argument that</span> <span m='936000'>has the advantage\
  \ of generalizing to the end-by-end</span> <span m='939000'>case. And the argument\
  \ goes as</span> <span m='941000'>follows for that. It uses the definition of the</span>\
  \ <span m='944000'>exponential function not as the inverse to the logarithm,</span>\
  \ <span m='948000'>which is where the fancy calculus books get it from,</span> <span\
  \ m='952000'>nor as the na\u010Fve high school method, e squared means</span> <span\
  \ m='956000'>you multiply e by itself and e cubed means you do it three</span> <span\
  \ m='960000'>times and so on. And e to the one-half means you</span> <span m='965000'>do\
  \ it a half a time or something.</span> <span m='967000'>So, the na\u010Fve definition\
  \ of the exponential function.</span> <span m='971000'>Instead, I will use the definition\
  \ of the exponential</span> <span m='974000'>function that comes from an infinite\
  \ series.</span> <span m='977000'>Leaving out the arbitrary constant that we don't\
  \ have to</span> <span m='981000'>bother with. e to the a t is the series one</span>\
  \ <span m='984000'>plus at plus a squared t squared over two factorial.</span> <span\
  \ m='992000'>I will put out one more term and let's call it quits there.</span>\
  \ <span m='998000'>If I take this then argument goes let's just differentiate</span>\
  \ <span m='1004000'>it. In other words,</span> <span m='1006000'>what is the derivative\
  \ of e to the at with respect to t?</span> <span m='1012000'>Well, just differentiating\
  \ term</span> <span m='1017000'>by term it is zero plus the first term is a,</span>\
  \ <span m='1021000'>the next term is a squared times t.</span> <span m='1028000'>This\
  \ differentiates to t squared over two factorial.</span> <span m='1033000'>And the\
  \ answer is that this is</span> <span m='1037000'>equal to a times, if you factor\
  \ out the a,</span> <span m='1041000'>what is left is one plus a t plus a squared\
  \ t squared over</span> <span m='1046000'>two factorial</span> <span m='1052000'>In\
  \ other words, it is simply e to the at.</span> <span m='1054000'>In other words,</span>\
  \ <span m='1056000'>by differentiating the series, using the series definition of</span>\
  \ <span m='1060000'>the exponential and by differentiating it term by term,</span>\
  \ <span m='1064000'>I can immediately see that is satisfies this differential</span>\
  \ <span m='1068000'>equation. What about the arbitrary</span> <span m='1070000'>constant?\
  \ Well, if you would like,</span> <span m='1072000'>you can include it here, but\
  \ it is easier to observe</span> <span m='1076000'>that by linearity if e to the\
  \ a t solves the equation so does</span> <span m='1080000'>the constant times it\
  \ because the equation is linear.</span> <span m='1085000'>Now, that is the idea\
  \ that I am going to use to solve the system</span> <span m='1092000'>in general.\
  \ What are we doing to say?</span> <span m='1096000'>Well, what could we say? The\
  \ solution to,</span> <span m='1101000'>well, let's get two solutions at once by\
  \ writing a fundamental</span> <span m='1108000'>matrix. \"A\" fundamental matrix,</span>\
  \ <span m='1113000'>I don't claim it is \"the\" one, for the system x prime equals\
  \ A</span> <span m='1121000'>x. That is what we are trying to</span> <span m='1126000'>solve.\
  \ And we are going to get two</span> <span m='1131000'>solutions by getting a fundamental\
  \ matrix for it.</span> <span m='1137000'>The answer is e to the a t.</span> <span\
  \ m='1144000'>Isn't that what it should be? I had a little a.</span> <span m='1147000'>Now\
  \ we have a matrix. Okay, just put the matrix up</span> <span m='1151000'>there.\
  \ Now, what on earth?</span> <span m='1153000'>The first person who must have thought\
  \ of this,</span> <span m='1156000'>it happened about 100 years ago, what meaning\
  \ should be</span> <span m='1160000'>given to e to a matrix power? Well, clearly\
  \ the two na\u2022ve</span> <span m='1165000'>definitions won't work. The only possible\
  \ meaning you</span> <span m='1170000'>could try for is using the infinite series,</span>\
  \ <span m='1173000'>but that does work. So this is a definition I am</span> <span\
  \ m='1177000'>giving you, the exponential matrix.</span> <span m='1180000'>Now,\
  \ notice the A is a two-by-two matrix multiplying it</span> <span m='1184000'>by\
  \ t. What I have up here is that</span> <span m='1186000'>it's basically a two-by-two\
  \ matrix.</span> <span m='1189000'>Its entries involve t, but it's a two-by-two\
  \ matrix.</span> <span m='1193000'>Okay. We are trying to get the analog</span>\
  \ <span m='1196000'>of that formula over there. Well, leave the first term out</span>\
  \ <span m='1202000'>just for a moment. The next term is going to</span> <span m='1205000'>surely\
  \ be A times t. This is a two-by-two matrix,</span> <span m='1209000'>right? What\
  \ should the next term be?</span> <span m='1212000'>Well, A squared times t squared\
  \ over two factorial.</span> <span m='1216000'>What kind of a guy is that? Well,\
  \ if A is a two-by-two</span> <span m='1220000'>matrix so is A squared. How about\
  \ this?</span> <span m='1223000'>This is just a scalar which multiplies every entry\
  \ of A</span> <span m='1228000'>squared. And, therefore,</span> <span m='1230000'>this\
  \ is still a two-by-two matrix.</span> <span m='1233000'>That is a two-by-two matrix.\
  \ This is a two-by-two matrix.</span> <span m='1236000'>No matter how many times\
  \ you multiply A by itself it stays a</span> <span m='1240000'>two-by-two matrix.\
  \ It gets more and more</span> <span m='1243000'>complicated looking but it is always\
  \ a two-by-two matrix.</span> <span m='1246000'>And now I am multiplying every entry\
  \ of that by the scalar t</span> <span m='1250000'>cubed over three factorial.</span>\
  \ <span m='1253000'>I am continuing on in that way. What I get, therefore,</span>\
  \ <span m='1256000'>is a sum of two-by-two matrices.</span> <span m='1260000'>Well,\
  \ you can add two-by-two matrices to each other.</span> <span m='1263000'>We've\
  \ never made an infinite series of them,</span> <span m='1266000'>we haven't done\
  \ it, but others have.</span> <span m='1269000'>And this is what they wrote. The\
  \ only question is,</span> <span m='1272000'>what should we put in the beginning?</span>\
  \ <span m='1275000'>Over there I have the number one.</span> <span m='1277000'>But\
  \ I, of course, cannot add the number one to a</span> <span m='1280000'>two-by-two\
  \ matrices. What goes here must be a</span> <span m='1283000'>two-by-two matrix,\
  \ which is the closest thing to</span> <span m='1287000'>one I can think of. What\
  \ should it be?</span> <span m='1291000'>The I. Two-by-two I.</span> <span m='1292000'>Two-by-two\
  \ identity matrix looks like the natural candidate</span> <span m='1297000'>for\
  \ what to put there. And, in fact,</span> <span m='1300000'>it is the right thing\
  \ to put there.</span> <span m='1302000'>Okay. Now I have a conjecture,</span> <span\
  \ m='1305000'>you know, purely formally, changing only with a keystroke</span> <span\
  \ m='1309000'>of the computer, all the little a's have been</span> <span m='1313000'>changed\
  \ to capital A's. And now all I have to do is</span> <span m='1317000'>wonder if\
  \ this is going to work. Well, what is the basic thing I</span> <span m='1323000'>have\
  \ to check to see that it is the fundamental matrix?</span> <span m='1327000'>The\
  \ question is, I wrote it down all right,</span> <span m='1331000'>but is this a\
  \ fundamental matrix for the system?</span> <span m='1334000'>Well, I have a way\
  \ of recognizing a fundamental matrix</span> <span m='1339000'>when I see one. The\
  \ critical thing is that it</span> <span m='1342000'>should satisfy this matrix\
  \ differential equation.</span> <span m='1346000'>That is what I should verify.\
  \ Does this guy that I have</span> <span m='1352000'>written down satisfy this equation?</span>\
  \ <span m='1355000'>And the answer is, number two is,</span> <span m='1357000'>it\
  \ satisfies x prime equals Ax.</span> <span m='1361000'>In other words, plugging\
  \ in x equals this e to</span> <span m='1365000'>the at, whose definition I just\
  \ gave</span> <span m='1369000'>you. If I substitute that in,</span> <span m='1371000'>does\
  \ it satisfy that matrix differential equation?</span> <span m='1376000'>The answer\
  \ is yes. I am not going to calculate it</span> <span m='1380000'>out because the\
  \ calculation is actually identical to what I did</span> <span m='1384000'>there.\
  \ The only difference is when I</span> <span m='1386000'>differentiated it term\
  \ by term, how do you differentiate</span> <span m='1390000'>something like this?\
  \ Well, you differentiate every</span> <span m='1393000'>term in it. But, if you\
  \ work it out,</span> <span m='1395000'>this is a constant matrix, every term of\
  \ which is</span> <span m='1398000'>multiplied by t squared over two factorial.</span>\
  \ <span m='1401000'>Well, if you differentiate every entry of that constant,</span>\
  \ <span m='1405000'>of that matrix, what you are going to get is A</span> <span\
  \ m='1407000'>squared times just the derivative of that part,</span> <span m='1410000'>which\
  \ is simply t. In other words,</span> <span m='1414000'>the formal calculation looks\
  \ absolutely identical to that.</span> <span m='1420000'>So the answer to this is\
  \ yes, by the same calculation as</span> <span m='1425000'>before, as for the one-by-one\
  \ case.</span> <span m='1428000'>And now the only other thing to check is that the\
  \ determinant is</span> <span m='1435000'>not zero. In fact, the determinant is\
  \ not</span> <span m='1439000'>zero at one point. That is all you have to check.</span>\
  \ <span m='1444000'>What is x of zero? What is the value of the</span> <span m='1448000'>determinant\
  \ of x is e to the At?</span> <span m='1451000'>What is the value of this thing\
  \ at zero?</span> <span m='1454000'>Here is my function. If I plug in t equals zero,</span>\
  \ <span m='1458000'>what is it equal to? I.</span> <span m='1460000'>What is the\
  \ determinant of I? One.</span> <span m='1462000'>It is certainly not zero.</span>\
  \ <span m='1478000'>By writing down this infinite series, I have my two solutions.</span>\
  \ <span m='1481000'>Its columns give me two solutions to the original</span> <span\
  \ m='1484000'>system. There were no eigenvalues,</span> <span m='1487000'>no eigenvectors.\
  \ I have a formula for the</span> <span m='1489000'>answer. What is the formula?</span>\
  \ <span m='1491000'>It is e to the At. And, of course,</span> <span m='1494000'>anybody\
  \ reading the paper is supposed to know what e to the</span> <span m='1497000'>At\
  \ is. It means that.</span> <span m='1500000'>This is just marvelous. There must\
  \ be a fly in the</span> <span m='1503000'>ointment somewhere. Only a teeny little\
  \ fly.</span> <span m='1507000'>There is a teeny little fly because it is almost\
  \ impossible</span> <span m='1511000'>to calculate that series for all reasonable\
  \ times.</span> <span m='1515000'>However, once in a while it is. Let me give you\
  \ an example</span> <span m='1520000'>where it is possible to calculate the series\
  \ and were</span> <span m='1524000'>you get a nice answer. Let's work out an example.</span>\
  \ <span m='1536000'>By the way, you know, nowadays, we are not back 50</span> <span\
  \ m='1540000'>years, the exponential matrix has the same status on,</span> <span\
  \ m='1545000'>say, a Matlab or Maple or Mathematica, as the ordinary</span> <span\
  \ m='1551000'>exponential function does. It is just a command you type</span> <span\
  \ m='1556000'>in. You type in your matrix.</span> <span m='1560000'>And you now\
  \ say EXP of that matrix and out comes the answer</span> <span m='1564000'>to as\
  \ many decimal places as you want.</span> <span m='1566000'>It will be square matrix\
  \ with entries carefully written out.</span> <span m='1570000'>So, in that sense,\
  \ the fact that we cannot</span> <span m='1573000'>calculate it shouldn't bother\
  \ us.</span> <span m='1575000'>There are machines to do the calculations.</span>\
  \ <span m='1578000'>What we are interested in is it as a theoretical tool.</span>\
  \ <span m='1582000'>But, in order to get any feeling for this at all,</span> <span\
  \ m='1585000'>we certainly have to do a few calculations.</span> <span m='1590000'>Let's\
  \ do an easy one. Let's consider the system x</span> <span m='1594000'>prime equals\
  \ y, y prime equals x.</span> <span m='1599000'>This is very easily done by elimination,\
  \ but that is</span> <span m='1603000'>forbidden. First of all,</span> <span m='1605000'>we\
  \ write it as a matrix. It's the system x prime equals</span> <span m='1610000'>zero,\
  \ one, one, zero, x.</span> <span m='1613000'>Here is my A.</span> <span m='1615000'>And\
  \ so e to the At is going to be --</span> <span m='1621000'>A is zero, one, one,\
  \ zero.</span> <span m='1622000'>What we want to</span> <span m='1625000'>calculate\
  \ is we are going to get both solutions at once by</span> <span m='1628000'>calculating\
  \ it one fell swoop e to the At.</span> <span m='1632000'>Okay. E to the At equals.</span>\
  \ <span m='1633000'>I am going to actually write out these guys.</span> <span m='1636000'>Well,\
  \ obviously the hard part, the part which is normally</span> <span m='1640000'>going\
  \ to prevent us from calculating this series</span> <span m='1643000'>explicitly,\
  \ by hand anyway, because, as I said,</span> <span m='1646000'>the computer can\
  \ always do it. The value, how do we raise a</span> <span m='1652000'>matrix to\
  \ a high power? You just keep multiplying and</span> <span m='1657000'>multiplying\
  \ and multiplying. That looks like a rather</span> <span m='1661000'>forbidding\
  \ and unpromising activity.</span> <span m='1664000'>Well, here it is easy. Let's\
  \ see what happens.</span> <span m='1668000'>If that is A, what is A squared?</span>\
  \ <span m='1671000'>I am going to have to calculate that as part of the series.</span>\
  \ <span m='1676000'>That is going to be zero, one, one, zero times zero,</span>\
  \ <span m='1680000'>one, one, zero, which is one,</span> <span m='1683000'>zero,\
  \ zero, one.</span> <span m='1690000'>We got saved. It is the identity.</span> <span\
  \ m='1693000'>Now, from this point on we don't have to do anymore</span> <span m='1697000'>calculations,\
  \ but I will do them anyway.</span> <span m='1701000'>What is A cubed? Don't start\
  \ from scratch again.</span> <span m='1706000'>No, no, no. A cubed is A squared\
  \ times A.</span> <span m='1710000'>And A squared is,</span> <span m='1714000'>in\
  \ real life, the identity.</span> <span m='1715000'>Of course, you would do all\
  \ this in your head,</span> <span m='1718000'>but I am being a good boy and writing\
  \ it all out.</span> <span m='1721000'>This is I, the identity, times A, which is\
  \ A.</span> <span m='1724000'>I will do one more. What is A to the fourth?</span>\
  \ <span m='1727000'>Now, you would be tempted to say A to the fourth is A</span>\
  \ <span m='1730000'>squared, which is I times I, which is I, but that would be</span>\
  \ <span m='1734000'>wrong. A to the fourth is A cubed</span> <span m='1738000'>times\
  \ A, which is, I have just</span> <span m='1742000'>calculated is A times A, right?</span>\
  \ <span m='1745000'>And now that is A squared, which is the identity.</span> <span\
  \ m='1750000'>It is clear, by this argument,</span> <span m='1752000'>it is going\
  \ to continue in the same way each time you add an A</span> <span m='1758000'>on\
  \ the right-hand side, you are going to keep</span> <span m='1762000'>alternating\
  \ between the identity, A, the next one will</span> <span m='1767000'>be identity,\
  \ the next will be A. The end result is that the</span> <span m='1774000'>first\
  \ term of the series is simply the identity;</span> <span m='1779000'>the next term\
  \ of the series is A, but it is multiplied by t.</span> <span m='1784000'>I will\
  \ keep the t on the outside.</span> <span m='1787000'>Remember, when you multiply\
  \ a matrix by a scalar,</span> <span m='1792000'>that means multiply every entry\
  \ by that scalar.</span> <span m='1796000'>This is the matrix zero, t, t, zero.</span>\
  \ <span m='1800000'>I will do a couple more terms.</span> <span m='1805000'>The\
  \ next term would be, well, A squared we just</span> <span m='1808000'>calculated\
  \ as the identity. That looks like this.</span> <span m='1812000'>Except now I multiply\
  \ every term by t squared over two</span> <span m='1816000'>factorial. All right.</span>\
  \ <span m='1819000'>I'll go for broke. The next one will be this times</span> <span\
  \ m='1822000'>t cubed over three factorial.</span> <span m='1825000'>And, fortunately,\
  \ I have run out of room.</span> <span m='1830000'>Okay, let's calculate then.</span>\
  \ <span m='1854000'>What is the final answer for e to At?</span> <span m='1857000'>I\
  \ have an infinite series of two-by-two matrices.</span> <span m='1860000'>Let's\
  \ look at the term in the upper left-hand corner.</span> <span m='1863000'>It is\
  \ one plus zero times t plus one times t squared over</span> <span m='1867000'>two\
  \ factorial plus zero times t.</span> <span m='1871000'>It is going to be,</span>\
  \ <span m='1872000'>in other words, one plus t squared over two</span> <span m='1875000'>factorial\
  \ plus the next term,</span> <span m='1878000'>which is not on the board but I think\
  \ you can see,</span> <span m='1881000'>is this. And it continues on in the same</span>\
  \ <span m='1884000'>way. How about the lower left term?</span> <span m='1888000'>Well,\
  \ that is zero plus t plus zero plus t cubed over three</span> <span m='1892000'>factorial\
  \ and so on.</span> <span m='1895000'>It is t plus t cubed over three factorial\
  \ plus t to the fifth</span> <span m='1899000'>over five factorial.</span> <span\
  \ m='1902000'>And the other terms in the</span> <span m='1904000'>other two corners\
  \ are just the same as these.</span> <span m='1907000'>This one, for example, is\
  \ zero plus t plus zero plus t</span> <span m='1911000'>cubed over three factorial.</span>\
  \ <span m='1915000'>And the lower one is one plus zero plus t squared</span> <span\
  \ m='1919000'>and so on. This is the same as one plus t</span> <span m='1924000'>squared\
  \ over two factorial and so on,</span> <span m='1928000'>and up here we have t plus\
  \ t cubed over three factorial</span> <span m='1934000'>and so on. Well, that matrix\
  \ doesn't look</span> <span m='1938000'>very square, but it is. It is infinitely\
  \ long</span> <span m='1942000'>physically, but it has one term here, one term here,</span>\
  \ <span m='1947000'>one term here and one term there.</span> <span m='1951000'>Now,\
  \ all we have to do is make those terms look a little</span> <span m='1955000'>better.\
  \ For here I have to rely on the</span> <span m='1958000'>culture, which you may\
  \ or may not posses.</span> <span m='1962000'>You would know what these series were\
  \ if only they</span> <span m='1966000'>alternated their signs. If this were a negative,</span>\
  \ <span m='1970000'>negative, negative then the top would be cosine t and</span>\
  \ <span m='1975000'>this would be sine t, but they don't.</span> <span m='1981000'>So\
  \ they are the next best thing.</span> <span m='1984000'>They are what? Hyperbolic.</span>\
  \ <span m='1986000'>The topic is not cosine t, but cosh t.</span> <span m='1991000'>The\
  \ bottle is sinh t.</span> <span m='1995000'>And how do we know this? Because you\
  \ remember.</span> <span m='1999000'>And what if I don't remember? Well, you know\
  \ now.</span> <span m='2004000'>That is why you come to class.</span> <span m='2015000'>Well,\
  \ for those of you who don't, remember,</span> <span m='2018000'>this is e to the\
  \ t plus e to the negative t.</span> <span m='2024000'>It should be over two, but\
  \ I don't have room to put in</span> <span m='2028000'>the two. This doesn't mean\
  \ I will omit</span> <span m='2032000'>it. It just means I will put it in</span>\
  \ <span m='2035000'>at the end by multiplying every entry of this matrix by</span>\
  \ <span m='2040000'>one-half. If you have forgotten what cosh</span> <span m='2044000'>t\
  \ is, it's e to the t plus e to the negative t divided by two.</span> <span m='2052000'>And\
  \ the similar thing for sinh t.</span> <span m='2054000'>There is your first explicit\
  \ exponential matrix calculated</span> <span m='2059000'>according to the definition.\
  \ And what we have found is the</span> <span m='2064000'>solution to the system\
  \ x prime equals y,</span> <span m='2068000'>y prime equals x. A fundamental matrix.</span>\
  \ <span m='2073000'>In other words, cosh t and sinh t satisfy both</span> <span\
  \ m='2076000'>solutions to that system. Now, there is one thing people</span> <span\
  \ m='2080000'>love the exponential matrix in particular for,</span> <span m='2084000'>and\
  \ that is the ease with which it solves the initial value</span> <span m='2088000'>problem.\
  \ It is exactly what happens when</span> <span m='2091000'>studying the single system,\
  \ the single equation x prime</span> <span m='2095000'>equals Ax, but let's do it\
  \ in general.</span> <span m='2100000'>Let's do it in general. What is the initial\
  \ value</span> <span m='2103000'>problem? Well, the initial value problem</span>\
  \ <span m='2107000'>is we start with our old system, but now I want to plug in</span>\
  \ <span m='2111000'>initial conditions. I want the particular solution</span> <span\
  \ m='2115000'>which satisfies the initial condition.</span> <span m='2118000'>Let's\
  \ make it zero to avoid complications,</span> <span m='2122000'>to avoid a lot of\
  \ notation. This is to be some starting</span> <span m='2126000'>value. This is\
  \ a certain constant</span> <span m='2129000'>vector. It is to be the value of the</span>\
  \ <span m='2133000'>solution at zero. And the problem is find what x</span> <span\
  \ m='2137000'>of t is. Well, if you are using the</span> <span m='2141000'>exponential\
  \ matrix it is a joke. It is a joke.</span> <span m='2145000'>Shall I derive it\
  \ or just do it?</span> <span m='2148000'>All right. The general solution,</span>\
  \ <span m='2151000'>let's derive it, and then I will put up the</span> <span m='2155000'>final\
  \ formula in a box so that you will know it is important.</span> <span m='2162000'>What\
  \ is the general solution? Well, I did that for you at the</span> <span m='2166000'>beginning\
  \ of the period. Once you have a fundamental</span> <span m='2169000'>matrix, you\
  \ get the general solution by multiplying it on</span> <span m='2173000'>the right\
  \ by an arbitrary constant vector.</span> <span m='2176000'>The general solution\
  \ is going to be x equals e to the At.</span> <span m='2180000'>That is my super\
  \ fundamental</span> <span m='2182000'>matrix, found without eigenvalues and eigenvectors.</span>\
  \ <span m='2187000'>And this should be multiplied by some unknown constant vector</span>\
  \ <span m='2192000'>c. The only question is,</span> <span m='2195000'>what should\
  \ the constant vector c be?</span> <span m='2198000'>To find c, I will plug in zero.\
  \ When t is zero,</span> <span m='2202000'>here I get x of zero, here I get e to\
  \ the A times</span> <span m='2207000'>zero times c. Now what is this?</span> <span\
  \ m='2211000'>This is the vector of initial conditions?</span> <span m='2215000'>What\
  \ is e to the A times zero? Plug in t equals zero.</span> <span m='2220000'>What\
  \ do you get? I.</span> <span m='2224000'>Therefore, c is what? c is x zero.</span>\
  \ <span m='2231000'>It is a total joke. And the solution is,</span> <span m='2237000'>the\
  \ initial value problem is x equals e to the At</span> <span m='2246000'>times x\
  \ zero. It is just what it would have</span> <span m='2252000'>been at one variable.\
  \ The only difference is that</span> <span m='2256000'>here we are allowed to put\
  \ the c out front.</span> <span m='2259000'>In other words, if I asked you to put\
  \ in the</span> <span m='2261000'>initial condition, you would probably write x</span>\
  \ <span m='2264000'>equals little x zero times e to the At.</span> <span m='2268000'>And\
  \ you would be tempted to do the same thing here,</span> <span m='2272000'>vector\
  \ x equals vector x zero times e to the At.</span> <span m='2275000'>Now, you cannot\
  \ do that. And, if you try to Matlab will</span> <span m='2280000'>hiccup and say\
  \ illegal operation.</span> <span m='2282000'>What is the illegal operation? Well,\
  \ x is a column vector.</span> <span m='2287000'>From the system it is a column\
  \ vector.</span> <span m='2290000'>That means the initial conditions are also a\
  \ column</span> <span m='2294000'>vector. You cannot multiply a column</span> <span\
  \ m='2297000'>vector out front and a square matrix afterwards.</span> <span m='2300000'>You\
  \ cannot. If you want to multiply a</span> <span m='2303000'>matrix by a column\
  \ vector, it has to come afterwards so</span> <span m='2307000'>you can do zing,\
  \ zing.</span> <span m='2311000'>There is no zing, you see.</span> <span m='2313000'>You\
  \ cannot put it in front. It doesn't work.</span> <span m='2316000'>So it must go\
  \ behind. That is the only place you</span> <span m='2320000'>might get tripped\
  \ up. And, as I say,</span> <span m='2323000'>if you try to type that in using Matlab,</span>\
  \ <span m='2327000'>you will immediately get error messages that it is illegal,</span>\
  \ <span m='2332000'>you cannot do that. Anyway, we have our solution.</span> <span\
  \ m='2336000'>There is our system. Our initial value problem</span> <span m='2340000'>anyway\
  \ is in pink, and its solution using the</span> <span m='2344000'>exponential matrix\
  \ is in green. Now, the only problem is we</span> <span m='2348000'>still have to\
  \ talk a little bit more about calculating this.</span> <span m='2353000'>Now, the\
  \ principle warning with an exponential matrix is that</span> <span m='2357000'>once\
  \ you have gotten by the simplest things involving the</span> <span m='2361000'>fact\
  \ that it solves systems, it gives you the fundamental</span> <span m='2366000'>matrix\
  \ for a system, then you start flexing your</span> <span m='2369000'>muscles and\
  \ say, oh, well, let's see what else</span> <span m='2373000'>we can do with this.\
  \ For example,</span> <span m='2376000'>the reason exponentials came into being\
  \ in the first place</span> <span m='2380000'>was because of the exponential law,\
  \ right?</span> <span m='2383000'>I will kill anybody who sends me emails saying,</span>\
  \ <span m='2386000'>what is the exponential law? The exponential law would say</span>\
  \ <span m='2390000'>that e to the A plus B is equal to e to the A times e to the\
  \ B.</span> <span m='2394000'>The law of exponents,</span> <span m='2398000'>in\
  \ other words. It is the thing that makes the</span> <span m='2401000'>exponential\
  \ function different from all other functions that it</span> <span m='2405000'>satisfies\
  \ something like that. Now, first of all,</span> <span m='2408000'>does this make\
  \ sense? That is are the symbols</span> <span m='2411000'>compatible? Let's see.</span>\
  \ <span m='2413000'>This is a two-by-two matrix, this is a two-by-two matrix,</span>\
  \ <span m='2416000'>so it does make sense to multiply them,</span> <span m='2419000'>and\
  \ the answer will be a two-by-two matrix.</span> <span m='2421000'>How about here?\
  \ This is a two-by-two matrix,</span> <span m='2424000'>add this to it. It is still\
  \ a two-by-two</span> <span m='2427000'>matrix. e to a two-by-two matrix still</span>\
  \ <span m='2429000'>comes out to be a two-by-two matrix.</span> <span m='2433000'>Both\
  \ sides are legitimate two-by-two matrices.</span> <span m='2437000'>The only question\
  \ is, are they equal?</span> <span m='2441000'>And the answer is not in a pig's\
  \ eye.</span> <span m='2445000'>How could this be? Well, I didn't make up these</span>\
  \ <span m='2450000'>laws. I just obey them.</span> <span m='2452000'>I wish I had\
  \ time to do a little calculation to show that</span> <span m='2458000'>it is not\
  \ true. It is true in certain special</span> <span m='2463000'>cases. It is true\
  \ in the special case,</span> <span m='2466000'>and this is pretty much if and only\
  \ if, the only case in which</span> <span m='2472000'>it is true is if A and B are\
  \ not arbitrary square matrices but</span> <span m='2477000'>commute with each other.\
  \ You see, if you start writing</span> <span m='2482000'>out the series to try to\
  \ check whether that law is true,</span> <span m='2487000'>you will get a bunch\
  \ of terms here, a bunch of terms here.</span> <span m='2494000'>And you will find\
  \ that those terms are pair-wise equal only</span> <span m='2498000'>if you are\
  \ allowed to let the matrices commute with each</span> <span m='2501000'>other.\
  \ In other words,</span> <span m='2503000'>if you can turn AB plus BA into twice\
  \ AB then</span> <span m='2507000'>everything will work fine. But if you cannot\
  \ do that it</span> <span m='2511000'>will not. Now, when do two square</span> <span\
  \ m='2513000'>matrices commute with each other?</span> <span m='2516000'>The answer\
  \ is almost never. It is just a lucky accident if</span> <span m='2522000'>they\
  \ do, but there are three cases of the lucky accident</span> <span m='2528000'>which\
  \ you should know. The three cases,</span> <span m='2532000'>I feel justified calling\
  \ it \"the\" three cases.</span> <span m='2537000'>Oh, well, maybe I shouldn't do\
  \ that.</span> <span m='2541000'>The three most significant examples are,</span>\
  \ <span m='2546000'>example number one, when A is a constant times the</span> <span\
  \ m='2551000'>identity matrix. In other words,</span> <span m='2556000'>when A is\
  \ a matrix that looks like this.</span> <span m='2559000'>That matrix commutes with\
  \ every other square matrix.</span> <span m='2563000'>If that is A, then this law\
  \ is always true</span> <span m='2566000'>and you are allowed to use this. Okay,\
  \ so that is one case.</span> <span m='2571000'>Another case, when A is more general,</span>\
  \ <span m='2574000'>is when B is equal to negative A.</span> <span m='2579000'>I\
  \ think you can see that that is going to work because A times</span> <span m='2583000'>minus\
  \ A is equal to minus A times A.</span> <span m='2587000'>Yeah, they are both equal\
  \ to A squared,</span> <span m='2591000'>except with a negative sign in front.</span>\
  \ <span m='2594000'>And the third case is when B is equal to the inverse of A</span>\
  \ <span m='2598000'>because A A inverse is the same as A inverse A.</span> <span\
  \ m='2603000'>They are both the identity.</span> <span m='2606000'>Of course, A\
  \ must have an inverse.</span> <span m='2610000'>Okay, let's suppose it does. Now,\
  \ of them this is,</span> <span m='2614000'>I think, the most important one because\
  \ it leads to this law.</span> <span m='2620000'>That is forbidden, but there is\
  \ one case of it</span> <span m='2624000'>which is not forbidden and that is here.</span>\
  \ <span m='2628000'>What will it say? Well, that will say that e to</span> <span\
  \ m='2632000'>the A minus A is equal to e to the A times e to</span> <span m='2638000'>the\
  \ negative A. This is true,</span> <span m='2643000'>even though the general law\
  \ is false.</span> <span m='2645000'>That is because A and negative A commute with\
  \ each other.</span> <span m='2650000'>But now what does this say? What is e to\
  \ the zero matrix?</span> <span m='2654000'>In other words, suppose I take the matrix\
  \ that</span> <span m='2658000'>is zero and plug it into the formula for e?</span>\
  \ <span m='2661000'>What do you get? e to the zero times t is I.</span> <span m='2664000'>It\
  \ has to be a two-by-two matrix if it is going to be</span> <span m='2669000'>anything.\
  \ It is the matrix I.</span> <span m='2673000'>This side is I. This side is the\
  \ exponential</span> <span m='2678000'>matrix. And what does that show?</span> <span\
  \ m='2681000'>It shows that the inverse matrix, the e to the A,</span> <span m='2687000'>is\
  \ e to the negative A. That is a very useful fact.</span> <span m='2693000'>This\
  \ is the main survivor of the exponential law.</span> <span m='2700000'>In general\
  \ it is false, but this standard corollary to</span> <span m='2705000'>the exponential\
  \ law is true, is equal to e to the minus A,</span> <span m='2710000'>just what\
  \ you would dream and hope would be true.</span> <span m='2716000'>Okay. I have\
  \ exactly two and a half</span> <span m='2719000'>minutes left in which to do the\
  \ impossible.</span> <span m='2723000'>All right. The question is,</span> <span\
  \ m='2725000'>how do you calculate e to the At?</span> <span m='2731000'>You could\
  \ use series, but it rarely works.</span> <span m='2734000'>It is too hard. There\
  \ are a few examples,</span> <span m='2738000'>and you will have some more for homework,\
  \ but in general it is</span> <span m='2743000'>too hard because it is too hard\
  \ to calculate the powers of a</span> <span m='2749000'>general matrix A. There\
  \ is another method,</span> <span m='2752000'>which is useful only for matrices\
  \ which are symmetric,</span> <span m='2757000'>but like that -- Well, it is more\
  \ than</span> <span m='2761000'>symmetric. These two have to be the same.</span>\
  \ <span m='2764000'>But you can handle those, as you will see from the</span> <span\
  \ m='2767000'>homework problems, by breaking it up this way and</span> <span m='2771000'>using\
  \ the exponential law. This would be zero,</span> <span m='2774000'>b, b, zero.</span>\
  \ <span m='2776000'>See, these two matrices commute with each other and,</span>\
  \ <span m='2779000'>therefore, I could use the exponential law.</span> <span m='2782000'>This\
  \ leaves all other cases. And here is the way to handle</span> <span m='2786000'>all\
  \ other cases. All other cases.</span> <span m='2790000'>In other words, if you\
  \ cannot calculate the</span> <span m='2793000'>series, this trick doesn't work,\
  \ I have done as follows.</span> <span m='2798000'>You start with an arbitrary fundamental\
  \ matrix,</span> <span m='2801000'>not the exponential matrix. You multiply it by\
  \ its value at</span> <span m='2806000'>zero, that is a constant matrix, and you\
  \ take the inverse of</span> <span m='2811000'>that constant matrix. It will have\
  \ one because,</span> <span m='2815000'>remember, the fundamental matrix never has\
  \ the determinant</span> <span m='2820000'>zero. So you can always take its</span>\
  \ <span m='2824000'>inverse-ready value of t. Now, what property does this</span>\
  \ <span m='2829000'>have? It is a fundamental matrix.</span> <span m='2832000'>How\
  \ do I know that? Well, because I found all</span> <span m='2836000'>fundamental\
  \ matrices for you. Take any one,</span> <span m='2841000'>multiply it by a square\
  \ matrix on the right-hand side,</span> <span m='2846000'>and you get still a fundamental\
  \ matrix.</span> <span m='2849000'>And what is its value at zero? Well, it is x\
  \ of zero times x</span> <span m='2857000'>of zero inverse. Its value at zero is\
  \ the</span> <span m='2862000'>identity. Now, e to the At has</span> <span m='2868000'>these\
  \ same two properties.</span> <span m='2876000'>Namely, it is a fundamental matrix\
  \ and its value at zero is</span> <span m='2881000'>the identity. Conclusion, this\
  \ is e to the At.</span> <span m='2885000'>And that is the garden variety</span>\
  \ <span m='2888000'>method of calculating the exponential matrix,</span> <span m='2891000'>if\
  \ you want to give it explicitly.</span> <span m='2893000'>Start with any fundamental\
  \ matrix calculated,</span> <span m='2896000'>you should forgive the expression\
  \ using eigenvalues and</span> <span m='2900000'>eigenvectors and putting the solutions\
  \ into the columns.</span> <span m='2904000'>Evaluate it at zero, take its inverse\
  \ and multiply</span> <span m='2908000'>the two. And what you end up with has to</span>\
  \ <span m='2912000'>be the same as the thing calculated with that infinite</span>\
  \ <span m='2916000'>series. Okay. You will get lots of practice for homework and\
  \ tomorrow.</span> </p>"
