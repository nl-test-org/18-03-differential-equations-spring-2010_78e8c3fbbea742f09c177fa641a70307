title: 'Lecture 3: Solving First-order Linear ODEs'
transcript: '<p><span m=''9000''>This time, we started solving differential equations.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''13000''>This is the third lecture of the term, and I have yet to</span>
  <span m=''18000''>solve a single differential equation in this class.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''22000''>Well, that will be rectified from now until the end of the</span> <span
  m=''27000''>term. So, once you learn separation</span> <span m=''30000''>of variables,
  which is the most elementary</span> <span m=''34000''>method there is, the single,
  I think the single</span> <span m=''38000''>most important equation is the one that''s
  called the first</span> <span m=''43000''>order linear equation, both because it
  occurs</span> <span m=''47000''>frequently in models because it''s solvable,</span>
  <span m=''50000''>and-- I think that''s enough. If you drop the course after</span>
  <span m=''56000''>today you will still have learned those two important</span> <span
  m=''59000''>methods: separation of variables, and first order</span> <span m=''62000''>linear
  equations. So, what does such an equation</span> <span m=''66000''>look like? Well,
  I''ll write it in there.</span> </p><p><span m=''69000''>There are several ways
  of writing it, but I think the most</span> <span m=''73000''>basic is this. I''m
  going to use x as the</span> <span m=''76000''>independent variable because that''s
  what your book does.</span> </p><p><span m=''80000''>But in the applications, it''s
  often t,</span> <span m=''83000''>time, that is the independent variable.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''85000''>And, I''ll try to give you examples which show that.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''89000''>So, the equation looks like this.</span> </p><p><span m=''91000''>I''ll
  find some function of x times y prime plus some other</span> <span m=''96000''>function
  of x times y is equal to yet another function of x.</span> </p><p><span m=''100000''>Obviously,
  the x doesn''t have</span> <span m=''106000''>the same status here that y does,
  so y is extremely limited</span> <span m=''110000''>in how it can appear in the
  equation.</span> </p><p><span m=''113000''>But, x can be pretty much arbitrary in
  those places.</span> </p><p><span m=''117000''>So, that''s the equation we are talking
  about,</span> <span m=''120000''>and I''ll put it up. This is the first version
  of</span> <span m=''125000''>it, and we''ll call them purple. Now, why is that called
  the</span> <span m=''130000''>linear equation? The word linear is a very</span>
  <span m=''134000''>heavily used word in mathematics, science,</span> <span m=''138000''>and
  engineering. For the moment,</span> <span m=''140000''>the best simple answer is
  because it''s linear in y and y</span> <span m=''145000''>prime, the variables y
  and y prime.</span> </p><p><span m=''151000''>Well, y prime is not a variable.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''153000''>Well, you will learn, in a certain sense,</span> <span
  m=''156000''>it helps to think of it as one, not right now perhaps,</span> <span
  m=''161000''>but think of it as linear. The most closely analogous</span> <span
  m=''165000''>thing would be a linear equation, a real linear</span> <span m=''169000''>equation,
  the kind you studied in high school,</span> <span m=''173000''>which would look
  like this. It would have two variables,</span> <span m=''178000''>and, I guess,
  constant coefficients,</span> <span m=''180000''>equal c. Now, that''s a linear
  equation.</span> </p><p><span m=''185000''>And that''s the sense in which this is
  linear.</span> </p><p><span m=''189000''>It''s linear in y prime and y, which are
  the analogs of the</span> <span m=''194000''>variables y1 and y2. A little bit of
  terminology,</span> <span m=''198000''>if c is equal to zero, it''s called homogeneous,</span>
  <span m=''202000''>the same way this equation is called homogeneous,</span> <span
  m=''206000''>as you know from 18.02, if the right-hand side is zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''212000''>So, c of x I should write here, but I won''t.</span> </p><p><span m=''217000''>That''s
  called homogeneous. Now, this is a common form for</span> <span m=''222000''>the
  equation, but it''s not what it''s called</span> <span m=''226000''>standard form.
  The standard form for the</span> <span m=''230000''>equation, and since this is
  going to be a prime course of</span> <span m=''235000''>confusion, which is probably
  completely correct,</span> <span m=''240000''>but a prime source of confusion is
  what I meant.</span> </p><p><span m=''246000''>The standard linear form, and I''ll
  underline linear is</span> <span m=''251000''>the first co-efficient of y prime
  is taken to be one.</span> </p><p><span m=''256000''>So, you can always convert
  that to a standard form by simply</span> <span m=''261000''>dividing through by
  it. And if I do that,</span> <span m=''265000''>the equation will look like y prime
  plus, now,</span> <span m=''269000''>it''s common to not call it b anymore, the
  coefficient,</span> <span m=''275000''>because it''s really b over a. And, therefore,</span>
  <span m=''280000''>it''s common to adopt, yet, a new letter for it.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''284000''>And, the standard one that many people use is p.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''288000''>How about the right-hand side? We needed a letter for that,</span>
  <span m=''293000''>too. It''s c over a,</span> <span m=''294000''>but we''ll call
  it q. So, when I talk about the</span> <span m=''298000''>standard linear form for
  a linear first order equation,</span> <span m=''303000''>it''s absolutely that that
  I''m talking about.</span> </p><p><span m=''308000''>Now, you immediately see that
  there is a potential for</span> <span m=''313000''>confusion here because what did
  I call the standard form for a</span> <span m=''320000''>first-order equation? So,
  I''m going to say,</span> <span m=''325000''>not this. The standard first order
  form,</span> <span m=''329000''>what would that be? Well, it would be y prime</span>
  <span m=''335000''>equals, and everything else on the left-hand side.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''339000''>So, it would be y prime. And now, if I turn this into</span> <span
  m=''344000''>the standard first-order form, it would be negative p of x y</span>
  <span m=''350000''>plus q of x.</span> </p><p><span m=''353000''>But, of course,
  nobody would write negative p</span> <span m=''357000''>of x. So, now, I explicitly
  want to</span> <span m=''360000''>say that this is a form which I will never use
  for this</span> <span m=''365000''>equation, although half the books of the world
  do.</span> </p><p><span m=''372000''>In short, this poor little first-order equation
  belongs to</span> <span m=''375000''>two ethnic groups. It''s both a first order</span>
  <span m=''378000''>equation, and therefore, its standard form should be</span> <span
  m=''381000''>written this way, but it''s also a linear</span> <span m=''384000''>equation,
  and therefore its standard form should be used</span> <span m=''388000''>this way.
  Well, it has to decide,</span> <span m=''390000''>and I have decided for it. It
  is, above all,</span> <span m=''394000''>a linear equation, not just a first-order</span>
  <span m=''397000''>equation. And, in this course,</span> <span m=''400000''>this
  will always be the standard form.</span> </p><p><span m=''403000''>Now, well, what
  on earth is the difference?</span> </p><p><span m=''406000''>If you don''t do it
  that way, the difference is entirely in</span> <span m=''411000''>the sin(p). But,
  if you get the sign of p</span> <span m=''415000''>wrong in the answers, it is just
  a disaster from that</span> <span m=''420000''>point on. A trivial little change
  of sign</span> <span m=''424000''>in the answer produces solutions and functions
  which have totally</span> <span m=''429000''>different behavior. And, you are going
  to be really</span> <span m=''433000''>lost in this course. So, maybe I should draw
  a line</span> <span m=''437000''>through it to indicate, please don''t pay any attention</span>
  <span m=''441000''>to this whatsoever, except that we are not going to</span> <span
  m=''445000''>do that. Okay, well, what''s so important</span> <span m=''448000''>about
  this equation? Well, number one,</span> <span m=''452000''>it can always be solved.
  That''s a very,</span> <span m=''456000''>very big thing in differential equations.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''459000''>But, it''s also the equation which arises in a variety
  of</span> <span m=''464000''>models. Now, I''m just going to list a</span> <span
  m=''468000''>few of them. All of them I think you will</span> <span m=''471000''>need
  either in part one or part two of problem sets over these</span> <span m=''477000''>first
  couple of problem sets, or second and third maybe.</span> </p><p><span m=''484000''>But,
  of them, I''m going to put at the very</span> <span m=''489000''>top of the list
  of what I''ll call here, I''ll give it two</span> <span m=''496000''>names: the
  temperature diffusion model, well, it would be better</span> <span m=''504000''>to
  call it temperature concentration by analogy,</span> <span m=''509000''>temperature
  concentration model.</span> </p><p><span m=''515000''>There''s the mixing model,
  which is hardly less important.</span> </p><p><span m=''520000''>In other words,
  it''s almost as important.</span> </p><p><span m=''523000''>You have that in your
  problem set.</span> </p><p><span m=''526000''>And then, there are other, slightly
  less important models.</span> </p><p><span m=''532000''>There is the model of radioactive
  decay.</span> </p><p><span m=''535000''>There''s the model of a bank interest, bank
  account,</span> <span m=''540000''>various motion models, you know, Newton''s Law
  type</span> <span m=''544000''>problems if you can figure out a way of getting rid
  of the second</span> <span m=''550000''>derivative, some motion problems.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''555000''>A classic example is the motion of a rocket being fired
  off,</span> <span m=''563000''>etc., etc., etc. Now, today I have to pick a</span>
  <span m=''568000''>model. And, the one I''m going to pick</span> <span m=''573000''>is
  this temperature concentration model.</span> </p><p><span m=''580000''>So, this
  is going to be today''s model.</span> </p><p><span m=''583000''>Tomorrow''s model
  in the recitation, I''m asking the</span> <span m=''587000''>recitations to, among
  other things,</span> <span m=''590000''>make sure they do a mixing problem, A) to
  show you how to</span> <span m=''595000''>do it, and B) because it''s on the problem
  sets.</span> </p><p><span m=''600000''>That''s not a good reason, but it''s not
  a bad one.</span> </p><p><span m=''604000''>The others are either in part one or
  we will take them up</span> <span m=''609000''>later in the term. This is not going
  to be the</span> <span m=''613000''>only lecture on the linear equation.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''616000''>There will be another one next week of equal importance.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''621000''>But, we can''t do everything today.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''624000''>So, let''s talk about the temperature concentration model,</span> <span
  m=''628000''>except I''m going to change its name.</span> </p><p><span m=''632000''>I''m
  going to change its name to the conduction diffusion model.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''639000''>I''ll put conduction over there, and diffusion over here,</span> <span
  m=''644000''>let''s say, since, as you will see,</span> <span m=''647000''>the similarities,
  they are practically the same</span> <span m=''652000''>model. All that''s changed
  from one to</span> <span m=''655000''>the other is the name of the ideas.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''660000''>In one case, you call it temperature,</span> <span m=''663000''>and
  the other, you should call it</span> <span m=''666000''>concentration. But, the
  actual mathematics</span> <span m=''670000''>isn''t identical. So, let''s begin
  with</span> <span m=''674000''>conduction. All right, so,</span> <span m=''676000''>I
  need a simple physical situation that I''m modeling.</span> </p><p><span m=''681000''>So,
  imagine a tank of some liquid.</span> </p><p><span m=''684000''>Water will do as
  well as anything.</span> </p><p><span m=''687000''>And, in the inside is a suspended,
  somehow,</span> <span m=''691000''>is a chamber. A metal cube will do,</span> <span
  m=''697000''>and let''s suppose that its walls are partly insulated,</span> <span
  m=''702000''>not so much that no heat can get through.</span> </p><p><span m=''706000''>There
  is no such thing as perfect insulation anyway,</span> <span m=''711000''>except
  maybe an absolute perfect vacuum.</span> </p><p><span m=''716000''>Now, inside,
  so here on the outside is</span> <span m=''719000''>liquid. Okay, on the inside
  is,</span> <span m=''722000''>what I''m interested in is the temperature of this
  thing.</span> </p><p><span m=''730000''>I''ll call that T. Now, that''s different
  from the</span> <span m=''733000''>temperature of the external water bath.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''737000''>So, I''ll call that T sub e, T for temperature</span>
  <span m=''741000''>measured in Celsius, let''s say, for the sake of</span> <span
  m=''745000''>definiteness. But, this is the external</span> <span m=''748000''>temperature.
  So, I''ll indicate it with an e.</span> </p><p><span m=''753000''>Now, what is the
  model? Well, in other words,</span> <span m=''758000''>how do I set up a differential
  equation to model the situation?</span> </p><p><span m=''766000''>Well, it''s based
  on a physical law, which I think you know,</span> <span m=''773000''>you''ve had
  simple examples like this, the so-called Newton''s Law</span> <span m=''781000''>of
  cooling, -- -- which says that the rate of</span> <span m=''786000''>change, the
  temperature of the heat goes from the outside to</span> <span m=''792000''>the inside
  by conduction only. Heat, of course,</span> <span m=''796000''>can travel in various
  ways, by convection,</span> <span m=''799000''>by conduction, as here, or by radiation,</span>
  <span m=''803000''>are the three most common. Of these, I only want one,</span>
  <span m=''808000''>namely transmission of heat by conduction.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''813000''>And, that''s the way it''s probably a little better to call</span>
  <span m=''817000''>it the conduction model, rather than the temperature</span> <span
  m=''821000''>model, which might involve other ways for the heat to be</span> <span
  m=''826000''>traveling. So, dt, the independent</span> <span m=''829000''>variable,
  is not going to be x, as it was over there.</span> </p><p><span m=''833000''>It''s
  going to be t for time. So, maybe I should write that</span> <span m=''838000''>down.
  t equals time.</span> </p><p><span m=''839000''>Capital T equals temperature in
  degrees Celsius.</span> </p><p><span m=''845000''>So, you can put in the degrees
  Celsius if you want.</span> </p><p><span m=''848000''>So, it''s proportional to
  the temperature difference between</span> <span m=''853000''>these two. Now, how
  shall I write the</span> <span m=''856000''>difference? Write it this way because
  if</span> <span m=''859000''>you don''t you will be in trouble.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''861000''>Now, why do I write it that way?</span> </p><p><span m=''864000''>Well,
  I write it that way because I want this constant to</span> <span m=''868000''>be
  positive, a positive constant.</span> </p><p><span m=''872000''>In general, any
  constant, so, parameters which are</span> <span m=''875000''>physical, have some
  physical significance,</span> <span m=''879000''>one always wants to arrange the
  equation so that they are</span> <span m=''883000''>positive numbers, the way people
  normally think</span> <span m=''887000''>of these things. This is called the</span>
  <span m=''889000''>conductivity. The conductivity of what?</span> </p><p><span m=''892000''>Well,
  I don''t know, of the system of the situation,</span> <span m=''896000''>the conductivity
  of the wall, or the wall if the metal were</span> <span m=''901000''>just by itself.
  At any rate,</span> <span m=''903000''>it''s a constant. It''s thought of as a constant.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''907000''>And, why positive, well, because if the external</span>
  <span m=''910000''>temperature is bigger than the internal temperature,</span> <span
  m=''914000''>I expect T to rise, the internal temperature to</span> <span m=''918000''>rise.
  That means dT / dt,</span> <span m=''922000''>its slope, should be positive. So,
  in other words,</span> <span m=''926000''>if Te is bigger than T, I expect this
  number to be</span> <span m=''929000''>positive. And, that tells you that k must</span>
  <span m=''932000''>be a positive constant. If I had turned it the other</span> <span
  m=''936000''>way, expressed the difference in the reverse order,</span> <span m=''940000''>K
  would then be negative, have to be negative in order</span> <span m=''944000''>that
  this turn out to be positive in that situation I</span> <span m=''947000''>described.
  And, since nobody wants</span> <span m=''950000''>negative values of k, you have
  to write the equation</span> <span m=''953000''>in this form rather than the other
  way around.</span> </p><p><span m=''956000''>So, there''s our differential equation.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''959000''>It will probably have an initial condition.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''962000''>So, it could be the temperature at the starting time should be</span>
  <span m=''966000''>some given number, T zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''970000''>But,
  the condition could be given in other ways.</span> </p><p><span m=''973000''>One
  can ask, what''s the temperature as time</span> <span m=''975000''>goes to infinity,
  for example?</span> </p><p><span m=''977000''>There are different ways of getting
  that initial condition.</span> </p><p><span m=''981000''>Okay, that''s the conduction
  model.</span> </p><p><span m=''983000''>What would the diffusion model be?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''985000''>The diffusion model, mathematically,</span> <span m=''987000''>would
  be, word for word, the same.</span> </p><p><span m=''991000''>The only difference
  is that now, what I imagine is I''ll draw</span> <span m=''996000''>the picture
  the same way, except now I''m going to put,</span> <span m=''1001000''>label the
  inside not with a T but with a C,</span> <span m=''1005000''>C for concentration.
  It''s in an external water bath,</span> <span m=''1010000''>let''s say. So, there
  is an external</span> <span m=''1013000''>concentration. And, what I''m talking
  about is</span> <span m=''1017000''>some chemical, let''s say salt will do as well</span>
  <span m=''1021000''>as anything. So, C is equal to salt</span> <span m=''1026000''>concentration
  inside, and Ce would be the salt</span> <span m=''1032000''>concentration outside,
  outside in the water bath.</span> </p><p><span m=''1038000''>Now, I imagine some
  mechanism, so this is a salt solution.</span> </p><p><span m=''1046000''>That''s
  a salt solution. And, I imagine some mechanism</span> <span m=''1052000''>by which
  the salt can diffuse, it''s a diffusion model now,</span> <span m=''1056000''>diffuse
  from here into the air or possibly out the other way.</span> </p><p><span m=''1060000''>And
  that''s usually done by vaguely referring to the outside</span> <span m=''1065000''>as
  a semi-permeable membrane, semi-permeable,</span> <span m=''1068000''>so that the
  salt will have a little hard time getting through</span> <span m=''1073000''>but
  permeable, so that it won''t be blocked</span> <span m=''1076000''>completely. So,
  there''s a membrane.</span> </p><p><span m=''1080000''>You write the semi-permeable
  membrane outside,</span> <span m=''1086000''>outside the inside. Well, I give up.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1090000''>You know, membrane somewhere. Sorry, membrane wall.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1097000''>How''s that? Now, what''s the equation?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1101000''>Well, the equation is the same, except it''s called the</span> <span
  m=''1108000''>diffusion equation. I don''t think Newton got his</span> <span m=''1114000''>name
  on this. The diffusion equation says</span> <span m=''1117000''>that the rate at
  which the salt diffuses across the membrane,</span> <span m=''1122000''>which is
  the same up to a constant as the rate at which</span> <span m=''1127000''>the concentration
  inside changes, is some constant,</span> <span m=''1131000''>usually called k still,
  okay.</span> </p><p><span m=''1134000''>Do I contradict? Okay, let''s keep calling
  it k1.</span> </p><p><span m=''1138000''>Now it''s different, times Ce minus C.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1141000''>And, for the same reason as before, if the external</span>
  <span m=''1145000''>concentration is bigger than the internal concentration,</span>
  <span m=''1150000''>we expect salt to flow in. That will make C rise.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1155000''>It will make this positive, and therefore,</span> <span m=''1158000''>we
  want k to be positive, just k1 to be positive for the</span> <span m=''1162000''>same
  reason it had to be positive before.</span> </p><p><span m=''1165000''>So, in each
  case, the model that I''m talking</span> <span m=''1168000''>about is the differential
  equation.</span> </p><p><span m=''1171000''>So, maybe I should, let''s put that,</span>
  <span m=''1173000''>make that clear. Or, I would say that this first</span> <span
  m=''1178000''>order differential equation models this physical situation,</span>
  <span m=''1182000''>and the same thing is true on the other side over here.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1186000''>This is the diffusion equation, and this is the conduction</span>
  <span m=''1190000''>equation. Now, if you are in any doubt</span> <span m=''1193000''>about
  the power of differential equations, the point is,</span> <span m=''1197000''>when
  I talk about this thing, I don''t have to say which of</span> <span m=''1201000''>these
  I''m following. I''ll use neutral variables like</span> <span m=''1206000''>Y and
  X to solve these equations.</span> </p><p><span m=''1209000''>But, with a single
  stroke, I will be handling those</span> <span m=''1213000''>situations together.
  And, that''s the power of the</span> <span m=''1216000''>method. Now, you obviously
  must be</span> <span m=''1219000''>wondering, look, these look very,</span> <span
  m=''1222000''>very special. He said he was going to talk</span> <span m=''1225000''>about
  the first, general first-order equation.</span> </p><p><span m=''1228000''>But,
  these look rather special to me.</span> </p><p><span m=''1231000''>Well, not too
  special. How should we write it?</span> </p><p><span m=''1236000''>Suppose I write,
  let''s take the temperature</span> <span m=''1240000''>equation just to have something
  definite.</span> </p><p><span m=''1244000''>Notice that it''s in a form corresponding
  to Newton''s Law.</span> </p><p><span m=''1248000''>But it is not in the standard
  linear form.</span> </p><p><span m=''1252000''>Let''s put it in standard linear
  form, so at least you could see</span> <span m=''1257000''>that it''s a linear equation.
  So, if I put it in standard</span> <span m=''1262000''>form, it''s going to look
  like DTDTD little t plus KT is equal</span> <span m=''1267000''>to K times TE. Now,
  compare that with the</span> <span m=''1272000''>general, the way the general equation
  is supposed to look,</span> <span m=''1276000''>the yellow box over there, the standard
  linear form.</span> </p><p><span m=''1280000''>How are they going to compare? Well,
  this is a pretty general</span> <span m=''1284000''>function. This is general.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1286000''>This is a general function of T because I can make the
  external</span> <span m=''1291000''>temperature. I could suppose it behaves in</span>
  <span m=''1294000''>anyway I like, steadily rising,</span> <span m=''1297000''>decaying
  exponentially, maybe oscillating back and</span> <span m=''1300000''>forth for some
  reason. The only way in which it''s not</span> <span m=''1306000''>general is that
  this K is a constant.</span> </p><p><span m=''1310000''>So, I will ask you to be
  generous.</span> </p><p><span m=''1313000''>Let''s imagine the conductivity is changing
  over time.</span> </p><p><span m=''1317000''>So, this is usually constant, but there''s
  no law which says</span> <span m=''1323000''>it has to be. How could a conductivity
  change</span> <span m=''1328000''>over time? Well, we could suppose that</span>
  <span m=''1332000''>this wall was made of slowly congealing Jell-O,</span> <span
  m=''1336000''>for instance. It starts out as liquid,</span> <span m=''1340000''>and
  then it gets solid. And, Jell-O doesn''t transmit</span> <span m=''1346000''>heat,
  I believe, quite as well as liquid does,</span> <span m=''1350000''>as a liquid
  would. Is Jell-O a solid or liquid?</span> </p><p><span m=''1356000''>I don''t know.
  Let''s forget about that.</span> </p><p><span m=''1360000''>So, with this understanding,
  so let''s say not necessarily</span> <span m=''1366000''>here, but not necessarily,
  I can think of this,</span> <span m=''1371000''>therefore, by allowing K to vary
  with time.</span> </p><p><span m=''1375000''>And the external temperature to vary
  with time.</span> </p><p><span m=''1380000''>I can think of it as a general, linear
  equation.</span> </p><p><span m=''1387000''>So, these models are not special.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1389000''>They are fairly general. Well, I did promise you I would</span>
  <span m=''1393000''>solve an equation, and that this lecture,</span> <span m=''1396000''>I
  still have not solved any equations.</span> </p><p><span m=''1398000''>OK, time
  to stop temporizing and solve.</span> </p><p><span m=''1401000''>So, I''m going
  to, in order not to play favorites</span> <span m=''1404000''>with these two models,
  I''ll go back to,</span> <span m=''1407000''>and to get you used to thinking of
  the variables all the time,</span> <span m=''1411000''>that is, you know, be eclectic
  switching from one</span> <span m=''1415000''>variable to another according to which
  particular lecture you</span> <span m=''1419000''>happened to be sitting in. So,
  let''s take our equation in</span> <span m=''1427000''>the form, Y prime plus P
  of XY, the general form using the old</span> <span m=''1437000''>variables equals
  Q of X. Solve me.</span> </p><p><span m=''1444000''>Well, there are different ways
  of describing the solution</span> <span m=''1447000''>process. No matter how you
  do it,</span> <span m=''1450000''>it amounts to the same amount of work and there
  is always a</span> <span m=''1454000''>trick involved at each one of them since
  you can''t suppress a</span> <span m=''1458000''>trick by doing the problem some
  other way.</span> </p><p><span m=''1461000''>The way I''m going to do it, I think,
  is the best.</span> </p><p><span m=''1464000''>That''s why I''m giving it to you.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1466000''>It''s the easiest to remember. It leads to the least
  work,</span> <span m=''1470000''>but I have colleagues who would fight with me about
  that point.</span> </p><p><span m=''1476000''>So, since they are not here to fight
  with me I am free to do</span> <span m=''1481000''>whatever I like. One of the main
  reasons for</span> <span m=''1485000''>doing it the way I''m going to do is because
  I want you to get</span> <span m=''1491000''>what our word into your consciousness,</span>
  <span m=''1495000''>two words, integrating factor. I''m going to solve this</span>
  <span m=''1500000''>equation by finding and integrating factor of the form U</span>
  <span m=''1505000''>of X. What''s an integrating factor?</span> </p><p><span m=''1509000''>Well,
  I''ll show you not by writing an elaborate definition</span> <span m=''1513000''>on
  the board, but showing you what its</span> <span m=''1516000''>function is. It''s
  a certain function,</span> <span m=''1518000''>U of X, I don''t know what it is,
  but here''s what I wanted to</span> <span m=''1523000''>do. I want to multiply,</span>
  <span m=''1524000''>I''m going to drop the X''s a just so that the thing looks</span>
  <span m=''1528000''>less complicated. So, what I want to do is</span> <span m=''1533000''>multiply
  this equation through by U of X.</span> </p><p><span m=''1536000''>That''s why it''s
  called a factor because you''re going to multiply</span> <span m=''1542000''>everything
  through by it. So, it''s going to look like UY</span> <span m=''1547000''>prime
  plus PUY equals QU, and now, so far,</span> <span m=''1551000''>it''s just a factor.
  What makes it an integrating</span> <span m=''1555000''>factor is that this, after
  I do that,</span> <span m=''1558000''>I want this to turn out to be the derivative
  of something with</span> <span m=''1564000''>respect to X. You see the motivation
  for</span> <span m=''1568000''>that. If this turns out to be the</span> <span m=''1570000''>derivative
  of something, because I''ve chosen U so</span> <span m=''1573000''>cleverly, then
  I will be able to solve the equation immediately</span> <span m=''1577000''>just
  by integrating this with respect to X,</span> <span m=''1579000''>and integrating
  that with respect to X.</span> </p><p><span m=''1581000''>You just, then, integrate
  both sides with</span> <span m=''1584000''>respect to X, and the equation is solved.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1586000''>Now, the only question is, what should I choose for U?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1591000''>Well, if you think of the product formula,</span> <span
  m=''1594000''>there might be many things to try here.</span> </p><p><span m=''1597000''>But
  there''s only one reasonable thing to try.</span> </p><p><span m=''1600000''>Try
  to pick U so that it''s the derivative of U times Y.</span> </p><p><span m=''1605000''>See
  how reasonable that is? If I use the product rule on</span> <span m=''1609000''>this,
  the first term is U times Y prime.</span> </p><p><span m=''1612000''>The second
  term would be U prime times Y.</span> </p><p><span m=''1616000''>Well, I''ve got
  the Y there. So, this will work.</span> </p><p><span m=''1621000''>It works if,
  what''s the condition that you</span> <span m=''1625000''>must satisfy in order
  for that to be true?</span> </p><p><span m=''1629000''>Well, it must be that after
  it to the differentiation,</span> <span m=''1635000''>U prime turns out to be P
  times U.</span> </p><p><span m=''1639000''>So, is it clear? This is something we
  want to be</span> <span m=''1644000''>equal to, and the thing I will try to do it
  is by choosing U in</span> <span m=''1650000''>such a way that this equality will
  take place.</span> </p><p><span m=''1657000''>And then I will be able to solve the
  equation.</span> </p><p><span m=''1660000''>And so, here''s what my U prime must
  satisfy.</span> </p><p><span m=''1663000''>Hey, we can solve that. But please don''t
  forget that P</span> <span m=''1667000''>is P of X. It''s a function of X.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1669000''>So, if you separate variables, I''m going to do this.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1673000''>So, what is it, DU over U equals P of X times</span>
  <span m=''1676000''>DX. If I integrate that,</span> <span m=''1679000''>so, separate
  variables, integrate, and you''re going to</span> <span m=''1683000''>get DU over
  U integrates to the be the log of U,</span> <span m=''1687000''>and the other side
  integrates to be the integral of P of X DX.</span> </p><p><span m=''1692000''>Now,
  you can put an arbitrary constant there,</span> <span m=''1696000''>or you can think
  of it as already implied by the</span> <span m=''1699000''>indefinite integral.
  Well, that doesn''t tell us,</span> <span m=''1703000''>yet, what U is. What should
  U be?</span> </p><p><span m=''1706000''>Notice, I don''t have to find every possible
  U,</span> <span m=''1709000''>which works. All I''m looking for is one.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1714000''>All I want is a single view which satisfies that equation.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1718000''>Well, U equals the integral, E to the integral of PDX.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1722000''>That''s not too beautiful looking, but by differential</span>
  <span m=''1726000''>equations, things can get so complicated that in a week or</span>
  <span m=''1730000''>two, you will think of this as an extremely simple formula.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1735000''>So, there is a formula for our integrating factor.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1740000''>We found it. We will always be able to write</span> <span
  m=''1745000''>an integrating factor. Don''t worry about the arbitrary</span> <span
  m=''1751000''>constant because you only need one such U.</span> </p><p><span m=''1757000''>So:
  no arbitrary constant since only one U needed.</span> </p><p><span m=''1763000''>And,
  that''s the solution, the way we solve the linear</span> <span m=''1769000''>equation.
  OK, let''s take over,</span> <span m=''1775000''>and actually do it. I think it
  would be better to</span> <span m=''1782000''>summarize it as a clear-cut method.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1788000''>So, let''s do that. So, what''s our method?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1794000''>It''s the method for solving Y prime plus PY equals Q.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1804000''>Well, the first place, make sure it''s in standard</span> <span m=''1807000''>linear
  form. If it isn''t,</span> <span m=''1809000''>you must put it in that form. Notice,
  the formula for the</span> <span m=''1813000''>integrating factor, the formula for
  the integrating</span> <span m=''1816000''>factor involves P, the integral of PDX.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1819000''>So, you''d better get the right P.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1821000''>Otherwise, you are sunk. OK, so put it in standard</span> <span m=''1825000''>linear
  form. That way, you will have the</span> <span m=''1828000''>right P. Notice that
  if you wrote it in</span> <span m=''1832000''>that form, and all you remembered
  was E to the integral</span> <span m=''1835000''>PDX, the P would have the wrong
  sign.</span> </p><p><span m=''1838000''>If you''re going to write, that P should
  have a negative</span> <span m=''1841000''>sign there. So, do it this way,</span>
  <span m=''1843000''>and no other way. Otherwise, you will get</span> <span m=''1846000''>confused
  and get wrong signs. And, as I say,</span> <span m=''1849000''>that will produce
  wrong answers, and not just slightly</span> <span m=''1852000''>wrong answers, but
  disastrously wrong answers</span> <span m=''1855000''>from the point of view of
  the modeling if you really want</span> <span m=''1859000''>answers to physical problems.
  So, here''s a standard linear</span> <span m=''1866000''>form. Then, find the integrating</span>
  <span m=''1869000''>factor. So, calculate E to the</span> <span m=''1873000''>integral,
  PDX, the integrating factor,</span> <span m=''1877000''>and that multiply both,
  I''m putting this as both,</span> <span m=''1882000''>underlined that as many times
  as you have room in your notes.</span> </p><p><span m=''1891000''>Multiply both
  sides by this integrating factor by E to the</span> <span m=''1900000''>integral
  PDX. And then, integrate.</span> </p><p><span m=''1906000''>OK, let''s take a simple
  example.</span> </p><p><span m=''1911000''>Suppose we started with the equation
  XY prime minus Y</span> <span m=''1919000''>equals, I had X2, X3, something like
  that,</span> <span m=''1926000''>X3, I think, yeah, X2.</span> </p><p><span m=''1932000''>OK,
  what''s the first thing to do?</span> </p><p><span m=''1936000''>Put it in standard
  form. So, step zero will be to write</span> <span m=''1943000''>it as Y prime minus
  one over X times Y equals X2.</span> </p><p><span m=''1950000''>Let''s do the work
  first, and then I''ll talk about</span> <span m=''1954000''>mistakes. Well, we now
  calculate the</span> <span m=''1959000''>integrating factor. So, I would do it in
  steps.</span> </p><p><span m=''1963000''>You can integrate negative one over X,
  right?</span> </p><p><span m=''1968000''>That integrates to minus log X. So, the
  integrating factor is E</span> <span m=''1974000''>to the integral of this, DX.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1977000''>So, it''s E to the negative log X.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1982000''>Now, in real life, that''s not the way to leave</span> <span m=''1986000''>that.
  What is E to the negative log</span> <span m=''1990000''>X? Well, think of it as
  E to the</span> <span m=''1993000''>log X to the minus one. Or, in other words,</span>
  <span m=''1998000''>it is E to the log X is X. So, it''s one over X.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2003000''>So, the integrating factor is one over X.</span> </p><p><span m=''2007000''>OK,
  multiply both sides by the integrating factor.</span> </p><p><span m=''2014000''>Both
  sides of what? Both sides of this:</span> <span m=''2017000''>the equation written
  in standard form,</span> <span m=''2021000''>and both sides. So, it''s going to
  be one over</span> <span m=''2025000''>XY prime minus one over X2 Y is equal to
  X2 times one over X,</span> <span m=''2031000''>which is simply X. Now, if you have
  done the work</span> <span m=''2035000''>correctly, you should be able, now, to
  integrate the left-hand</span> <span m=''2041000''>side directly. So, I''m going
  to write it this</span> <span m=''2046000''>way. I always recommend that you put</span>
  <span m=''2049000''>it as extra step, well, put it as an extra step</span> <span
  m=''2053000''>the reason for using that integrating factor,</span> <span m=''2057000''>in
  other words, that the left-hand side is</span> <span m=''2060000''>supposed to be,
  now, one over X times Y prime.</span> </p><p><span m=''2064000''>I always put it
  that because there''s always a chance you made</span> <span m=''2069000''>a mistake
  or forgot something. Look at it, mentally</span> <span m=''2074000''>differentiated
  using the product rule just to check that,</span> <span m=''2079000''>in fact, it
  turns out to be the same as the left-hand side.</span> </p><p><span m=''2083000''>So,
  what do we get? One over X times Y prime plus Y</span> <span m=''2087000''>times
  the derivative of one over X, which indeed is negative one</span> <span m=''2093000''>over
  X2. And now, finally,</span> <span m=''2095000''>that''s 3A, continue, do the integration.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2098000''>So, you''re going to get, let''s see if we can do it
  all</span> <span m=''2102000''>on one board, one over X times Y is equal to</span>
  <span m=''2106000''>X plus a constant, X, sorry, X2 over two plus a</span> <span
  m=''2109000''>constant. And, the final step will be,</span> <span m=''2115000''>therefore,
  now I want to isolate Y by itself.</span> </p><p><span m=''2121000''>So, Y will
  be equal to multiply through by X.</span> </p><p><span m=''2126000''>X3 over two
  plus C times X. And, that''s the solution.</span> </p><p><span m=''2134000''>OK,
  let''s do one a little slightly more complicated.</span> </p><p><span m=''2140000''>Let''s
  try this one. Now, my equation is going to be</span> <span m=''2145000''>one, I''ll
  still keep two, Y and X, as the variables.</span> </p><p><span m=''2151000''>I''ll
  use T and F for a minute or two.</span> </p><p><span m=''2157000''>One plus cosine
  X, so, I''m not going to give you</span> <span m=''2163000''>this one in standard
  form either.</span> </p><p><span m=''2167000''>It''s a trick question. Y prime minus
  sine X times Y is</span> <span m=''2174000''>equal to anything reasonable, I guess.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2179000''>I think X, 2X, make it more exciting.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2184000''>OK, now, I think I should warn you where the mistakes are just</span>
  <span m=''2192000''>so that you can make all of them.</span> </p><p><span m=''2198000''>So,
  this is mistake number one. You don''t put it in standard</span> <span m=''2204000''>form.
  Mistake number two:</span> <span m=''2207000''>generally people can do step one
  fine.</span> </p><p><span m=''2211000''>Mistake number two is, this is my most common
  mistake,</span> <span m=''2217000''>so I''m very sensitive to it. But that doesn''t
  mean if you</span> <span m=''2223000''>make it, you''ll get any sympathy from me.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2226000''>I don''t give sympathy to myself.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2228000''>You are so intense, so happy at having found the</span> <span m=''2231000''>integrating
  factor, you forget to multiply Q by the</span> <span m=''2235000''>integrating factor
  also. You just handle the left-hand</span> <span m=''2239000''>side of the equation,
  if you forget about the</span> <span m=''2242000''>right-hand side. So, the emphasis
  on the both</span> <span m=''2245000''>here is the right-hand, please include the
  Q.</span> </p><p><span m=''2249000''>Please include the right-hand side.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2253000''>Any other mistakes? Well, nothing that I can think</span>
  <span m=''2257000''>of. Well, maybe only,</span> <span m=''2258000''>anyway, we
  are not going to make any mistakes the rest of</span> <span m=''2263000''>this lecture.
  So, what do we do?</span> </p><p><span m=''2265000''>We write this in standard form.
  So, it''s going to look like Y</span> <span m=''2270000''>prime minus sine X, sine
  X divided by one plus</span> <span m=''2274000''>cosine X times Y equals, my heart
  sinks because I know</span> <span m=''2279000''>I''m supposed to integrate something
  like this.</span> </p><p><span m=''2284000''>And, boy, that''s going to give me
  problems.</span> </p><p><span m=''2287000''>Well, not yet. With the integrating
  factor?</span> </p><p><span m=''2291000''>The integrating factor is, well, we want
  to calculate the</span> <span m=''2296000''>integral of negative sine X over one
  plus cosine.</span> </p><p><span m=''2300000''>That''s the integral of PDX. And,
  after that,</span> <span m=''2303000''>we have to exponentiate it. Well, can you
  do this?</span> </p><p><span m=''2308000''>Yeah, but if you stare at it a little
  while,</span> <span m=''2311000''>you can see that the top is the derivative of
  the bottom.</span> </p><p><span m=''2318000''>That is great. That means it integrates
  to be</span> <span m=''2322000''>the log of one plus cosine X. Is that right,</span>
  <span m=''2326000''>one over one plus cosine X times the derivative of this,</span>
  <span m=''2331000''>which is negative cosine X. Therefore, the integrating</span>
  <span m=''2336000''>factor is E to that. In other words,</span> <span m=''2339000''>it
  is one plus cosine X. Therefore, so this was step</span> <span m=''2345000''>zero.
  Step one, we found the</span> <span m=''2348000''>integrating factor. And now, step
  two,</span> <span m=''2352000''>we multiply through the integrating factor.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2357000''>And what do we get? We multiply through the</span> <span
  m=''2361000''>standard for equation by the integrating factor,</span> <span m=''2366000''>if
  you do that, what you get is,</span> <span m=''2369000''>well, Y prime gets the
  coefficient one plus cosine X,</span> <span m=''2375000''>Y prime minus sign X equals
  2X. Oh, dear.</span> </p><p><span m=''2380000''>Well, I hope somebody would giggle
  at this point.</span> </p><p><span m=''2385000''>What''s giggle-able about it? Well,
  that all this was totally</span> <span m=''2390000''>wasted work. It''s called spinning
  your</span> <span m=''2393000''>wheels. No, it''s not spinning your</span> <span
  m=''2396000''>wheels. It''s doing what you''re supposed</span> <span m=''2399000''>to
  do, and finding out that you wasted the entire time doing</span> <span m=''2405000''>what
  you were supposed to do. Well, in other words,</span> <span m=''2410000''>that net
  effect of this is to end up with the same equation we</span> <span m=''2416000''>started
  with. But, what is the point?</span> </p><p><span m=''2419000''>The point of having
  done all this was because now the</span> <span m=''2424000''>left-hand side is exactly
  the derivative of something,</span> <span m=''2429000''>and the left-hand side should
  be the derivative of what?</span> </p><p><span m=''2435000''>Well, it should be
  the derivative of one plus cosine X</span> <span m=''2439000''>times Y, all prime.
  Now, you can check that that''s</span> <span m=''2443000''>in fact the case. It''s
  one plus cosine X,</span> <span m=''2447000''>Y prime, plus minus sine X, the derivative
  of this side</span> <span m=''2451000''>times Y. So, if you had thought,</span>
  <span m=''2454000''>in looking at the equation, to say to yourself,</span> <span
  m=''2458000''>this is a derivative of that, maybe I''ll just check right</span>
  <span m=''2463000''>away to see if it''s the derivative of one plus cosine X</span>
  <span m=''2468000''>sine. You would have saved that work.</span> </p><p><span m=''2472000''>Well,
  you don''t have to be brilliant or clever,</span> <span m=''2476000''>or anything
  like that. You can follow your nose,</span> <span m=''2479000''>and it''s just,
  I want to give you a positive</span> <span m=''2483000''>experience in solving linear
  equations, not too negative.</span> </p><p><span m=''2488000''>Anyway, so we got
  to this point.</span> </p><p><span m=''2491000''>So, now this is 2X, and now we
  are ready to solve</span> <span m=''2497000''>the equation, which is the solution
  now will</span> <span m=''2502000''>be one plus cosine X times Y is equal to X2
  plus a constant,</span> <span m=''2509000''>and so Y is equal to X2 divided by X2
  plus a constant divided by</span> <span m=''2516000''>one plus cosine X. Suppose
  I have given you an</span> <span m=''2521000''>initial condition, which I didn''t.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2523000''>But, suppose the initial condition said that Y of zero</span>
  <span m=''2527000''>were one, for instance. Then, the solution would be,</span>
  <span m=''2530000''>so, this is an if, I''m throwing in at the end just</span> <span
  m=''2534000''>to make it a little bit more of a problem, how would I put,</span>
  <span m=''2537000''>then I could evaluate the constant by using the initial</span>
  <span m=''2541000''>condition. What would it be?</span> </p><p><span m=''2543000''>This
  would be, on the left-hand side,</span> <span m=''2545000''>one, on the right-hand
  side would be C over two.</span> </p><p><span m=''2550000''>So, I would get one
  equals C over two.</span> </p><p><span m=''2554000''>Is that correct? Cosine of
  zero is one,</span> <span m=''2559000''>so that''s two down below. Therefore, C
  is equal to two,</span> <span m=''2566000''>and that would then complete the solution.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2571000''>We would be X2 plus two over one plus cosine X.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2577000''>Now, you can do this in general, of course,</span> <span
  m=''2583000''>and get a general formula. And, we will have occasion to</span> <span
  m=''2590000''>use that next week. But for now,</span> <span m=''2593000''>why don''t
  we concentrate on the most interesting case,</span> <span m=''2598000''>namely that
  of the most linear equation, with constant</span> <span m=''2603000''>coefficient,
  that is, so let''s look at the linear</span> <span m=''2607000''>equation with constant
  coefficient, because that''s the</span> <span m=''2612000''>one that most closely
  models the conduction and diffusion</span> <span m=''2617000''>equations. So, what
  I''m interested in,</span> <span m=''2621000''>is since this is the, of them all,</span>
  <span m=''2623000''>probably it''s the most important case is the one where</span>
  <span m=''2627000''>P is a constant because of its application to that.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2630000''>And, many of the other, the bank account,</span> <span m=''2633000''>for
  example, all of those will use a</span> <span m=''2635000''>constant coefficient.
  So, how is the thing going to</span> <span m=''2638000''>look? Well, I will use
  the cooling.</span> </p><p><span m=''2641000''>Let''s use the temperature model,
  for example.</span> </p><p><span m=''2645000''>The temperature model, the equation
  will be DTDT plus</span> <span m=''2649000''>KT is equal to. Now, notice on the
  right-hand</span> <span m=''2653000''>side, this is a common error. You don''t put
  TE.</span> </p><p><span m=''2656000''>You have to put KTE because that''s what the
  equation says.</span> </p><p><span m=''2661000''>If you think units, you won''t
  have any trouble.</span> </p><p><span m=''2665000''>Units have to be compatible
  on both sides of a differential</span> <span m=''2670000''>equation. And therefore,</span>
  <span m=''2672000''>whatever the units were for capital KT, I''d have to have the</span>
  <span m=''2676000''>same units on the right-hand side, which indicates I cannot</span>
  <span m=''2680000''>have KT on the left of the differential equation,</span> <span
  m=''2683000''>and just T on the right, and expect the units to be</span> <span m=''2687000''>compatible.
  That''s not possible.</span> </p><p><span m=''2689000''>So, that''s a good way of
  remembering that if you''re</span> <span m=''2692000''>modeling temperature or concentration,</span>
  <span m=''2694000''>you have to have the K on both sides.</span> </p><p><span m=''2697000''>OK,
  let''s do, now, a lot of this we are going</span> <span m=''2700000''>to do in our
  head now because this is really too easy.</span> </p><p><span m=''2705000''>What''s
  the integrating factor? Well, the integrating factor is</span> <span m=''2710000''>going
  to be the integral of K, the coefficient now is just K.</span> </p><p><span m=''2716000''>P
  is a constant, K, and if I integrate KDT,</span> <span m=''2720000''>I get KT, and
  I exponentiate that.</span> </p><p><span m=''2723000''>So, the integrating factor
  is E to the KT.</span> </p><p><span m=''2728000''>I multiply through both sides,
  multiply by E to the KT,</span> <span m=''2734000''>and what''s the resulting equation?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2738000''>Well, it''s going to be , I''ll write it in the compact</span>
  <span m=''2744000''>form. It''s going to be E to the KT</span> <span m=''2747000''>times
  T, all prime. The differentiation is now,</span> <span m=''2753000''>of course,
  with respect to the time.</span> </p><p><span m=''2757000''>And, that''s equal to
  KTE, whatever that is,</span> <span m=''2762000''>times E to the KT. This is a function
  of T,</span> <span m=''2768000''>of course, the function of little time, sorry,</span>
  <span m=''2772000''>little T time. OK, and now,</span> <span m=''2775000''>finally,
  we are going to integrate.</span> </p><p><span m=''2778000''>What''s the answer?
  Well, it is E to the,</span> <span m=''2782000''>so, are we going to get E to the
  KT times T is,</span> <span m=''2787000''>sorry, K little t, K times time times
  the</span> <span m=''2791000''>temperature is equal to the integral of KTE.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2797000''>I''ll put the fact that it''s a function of T inside
  just to</span> <span m=''2802000''>remind you, E to the KT, and now I''ll put the
  arbitrary</span> <span m=''2806000''>constant. Let''s put in the arbitrary</span>
  <span m=''2809000''>constant explicitly. So, what will T be?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2813000''>OK, T will look like this, finally.</span> </p><p><span m=''2816000''>It
  will be E to the negative KT.</span> </p><p><span m=''2819000''>That''s on the outside.
  Then, you will integrate.</span> </p><p><span m=''2824000''>Of course, the difficulty
  of doing this integral depends</span> <span m=''2828000''>entirely upon how this
  external temperature varies.</span> </p><p><span m=''2832000''>But anyways, it''s
  going to be K times that</span> <span m=''2836000''>function, which I haven''t specified,
  E to the KT plus C</span> <span m=''2840000''>times E to the negative KT. Now, some
  people,</span> <span m=''2844000''>many, in fact, that almost always,</span> <span
  m=''2847000''>in the engineering literature, almost never write indefinite</span>
  <span m=''2852000''>integrals because an indefinite integral is indefinite.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2858000''>In other words, this covers not just one</span> <span
  m=''2860000''>function, but a whole multitude of functions which differ from</span>
  <span m=''2864000''>each other by an arbitrary constant.</span> </p><p><span m=''2866000''>So,
  in a formula like this, there''s a certain vagueness,</span> <span m=''2869000''>and
  it''s further compounded by the fact that I don''t know</span> <span m=''2873000''>whether
  the arbitrary constant is here.</span> </p><p><span m=''2875000''>I seem to have
  put it explicitly on the outside the</span> <span m=''2878000''>way you''re used
  to doing from calculus.</span> </p><p><span m=''2882000''>Many people, therefore,
  prefer,</span> <span m=''2884000''>and I think you should learn this, to do what
  is done in the</span> <span m=''2888000''>very first section of the notes called
  definite integral</span> <span m=''2893000''>solutions. If there''s an initial condition</span>
  <span m=''2896000''>saying that the internal temperature at time zero is some</span>
  <span m=''2900000''>given value, what they like to do is make this thing definite</span>
  <span m=''2905000''>by integrating here from zero to T, and making this a dummy</span>
  <span m=''2910000''>variable. You see, what that does is it</span> <span m=''2915000''>gives
  you a particular function, whereas, I''m sorry I didn''t put</span> <span m=''2922000''>in
  the DT one minus two. What it does is that when time</span> <span m=''2928000''>is
  zero, all this automatically disappears, and the arbitrary</span> <span m=''2935000''>constant
  will then be, it''s T.</span> </p><p><span m=''2940000''>So, in other words, C times
  this,</span> <span m=''2942000''>which is one, is that equal to [T?].</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2945000''>In other words, if I make this zero,</span> <span m=''2947000''>that
  I can write C as equal to this arbitrary starting value.</span> </p><p><span m=''2952000''>Now,
  when you do this, the essential thing,</span> <span m=''2955000''>and we''re going
  to come back to this next week,</span> <span m=''2958000''>but right away, because
  K is positive,</span> <span m=''2961000''>I want to emphasize that so much at the
  beginning of the</span> <span m=''2965000''>period, I want to conclude by showing
  you what its</span> <span m=''2969000''>significance is. This part disappears because
  K</span> <span m=''2974000''>is positive. The conductivity is positive.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2978000''>This part disappears as T goes to zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''2981000''>This
  goes to zero as T goes to infinity.</span> </p><p><span m=''2985000''>So, this is
  a solution that remains.</span> </p><p><span m=''2988000''>This, therefore, is called
  the steady state</span> <span m=''2992000''>solution, the thing which the temperature
  behaves like,</span> <span m=''2997000''>as T goes to infinity. This is called the
  transient.</span> </p><p><span m=''3001000''>because it disappears as T goes to
  infinity.</span> </p><p><span m=''3007000''>It depends on the initial condition,
  but it disappears,</span> <span m=''3011000''>which shows you, then, in the long
  run for this</span> <span m=''3015000''>type of problem the initial condition makes
  no difference.</span> </p><p><span m=''3020000''>The function behaves always the
  same way as T goes to infinity.</span> </p>'
