transcript: '<p><span m=''63000''>Okay, that''s, so to speak,</span> <span m=''65000''>the
  text for today. The Fourier series,</span> <span m=''69000''>and the Fourier expansion
  for f of t,</span> <span m=''74000''>so f of t, if it looks like this should be
  periodic,</span> <span m=''79000''>and two pi should be a period. Sometimes people
  rather</span> <span m=''85000''>sloppily say periodic with period two pi,</span>
  <span m=''89000''>but that''s a little ambiguous. So, this period could also be</span>
  <span m=''97000''>pi or a half pi or something like that as well.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''102000''>The an''s and bn''s are calculated according to these</span> <span
  m=''107000''>formulas. Now, we''re going to need in</span> <span m=''111000''>just
  a minute a consequence of those formulas,</span> <span m=''116000''>which, it''s
  not subtle, but because there are formulas</span> <span m=''121000''>for an and
  bn, it follows that once you know f</span> <span m=''126000''>of t, the an''s and
  bn''s are</span> <span m=''130000''>determined. Or, to put it another way,</span>
  <span m=''135000''>a function cannot have two different Fourier series.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''140000''>Or, to put it yet another way, if f of t,</span> <span m=''144000''>if
  two functions are equal, you''ll see why I write it in</span> <span m=''150000''>this
  rather peculiar form. Then, the Fourier series for f</span> <span m=''155000''>is
  the same as the Fourier series for g.</span> </p><p><span m=''160000''>And, the
  reason is because if f is equal to g,</span> <span m=''164000''>then this integral
  with an f there is the same as the</span> <span m=''169000''>integral with a g there.
  And therefore,</span> <span m=''172000''>the an''s come out to be the same.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''175000''>In the same way, the bn''s come out to be the</span> <span
  m=''178000''>same. So, the Fourier series are the</span> <span m=''181000''>same,
  coefficient by coefficient, for f and g.</span> </p><p><span m=''185000''>Now, my
  ultimate goal-- let''s all put down the argument since</span> <span m=''190000''>there
  are formulas, since we have formulas for an</span> <span m=''194000''>and bn. Now,
  a consequence of that is,</span> <span m=''199000''>well, let me first say, what
  I''m aiming at is you will</span> <span m=''203000''>be amazed at how long it''s
  going to take me to get to this.</span> </p><p><span m=''209000''>I just want to
  calculate the Fourier series for some rather</span> <span m=''213000''>simple periodic
  function. It''s going to look like this.</span> </p><p><span m=''218000''>So, here''s
  pi, and here''s negative pi.</span> </p><p><span m=''221000''>So, the function which
  just looks like t in between those</span> <span m=''225000''>two, so, it goes up
  to, it''s a function,</span> <span m=''229000''>t, more or less, goes up to pi here,</span>
  <span m=''231000''>minus pi there. But, of course,</span> <span m=''234000''>it''s
  got to be periodic of period two pi.</span> </p><p><span m=''239000''>Well, then,
  it just repeats itself after that.</span> </p><p><span m=''242000''>After this,
  it just does that, and so on.</span> </p><p><span m=''244000''>It''s a little ambiguous
  what happens at these endpoints.</span> </p><p><span m=''248000''>Well, let''s not
  worry about that for the moment,</span> <span m=''252000''>and frankly, it won''t
  really matter because</span> <span m=''255000''>the integrals don''t care about
  what happens in individual</span> <span m=''259000''>points. So, there''s my f of
  t.</span> </p><p><span m=''261000''>Now, I, of course, could start doing it right</span>
  <span m=''264000''>away. But, you will quickly find,</span> <span m=''267000''>if
  you start doing these problems and hacking around with</span> <span m=''270000''>them,
  that the calculations seem really quite long.</span> </p><p><span m=''274000''>And
  therefore, in the first half of the</span> <span m=''277000''>period, the first
  half of the period I want to show you how to</span> <span m=''281000''>shorten the
  calculations. And in the second half of the</span> <span m=''287000''>period, after
  we''ve done that and calculated this thing</span> <span m=''290000''>successfully,
  I hope, I want to show you how</span> <span m=''294000''>to remove various restrictions
  on these functions,</span> <span m=''297000''>how to extend the range of Fourier
  series.</span> </p><p><span m=''301000''>Well, one obvious thing, for example,</span>
  <span m=''303000''>is suppose the function isn''t periodic of period two pi.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''306000''>Suppose it has some other period.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''308000''>Does that mean there''s no formula?</span> </p><p><span m=''310000''>Well,
  of course not. There''s a formula.</span> </p><p><span m=''313000''>But, we need
  to know what it is, particularly in the</span> <span m=''316000''>applications,
  the period is rarely two pi.</span> </p><p><span m=''319000''>It''s normally one,
  or something like that.</span> </p><p><span m=''321000''>But, let''s first of all,
  I''m sure what you will</span> <span m=''324000''>appreciate is how the calculations
  can get shortened.</span> </p><p><span m=''329000''>Now, the main way of shortening
  them is by using evenness and</span> <span m=''335000''>oddness. And, what I claim
  is this,</span> <span m=''339000''>that if f of t is an even function,</span> <span
  m=''344000''>remember what that means, that f of negative t is equal</span> <span
  m=''351000''>to f of t. Cosine is a good example,</span> <span m=''357000''>of course,
  cosine nt; are all these</span> <span m=''362000''>functions are even functions.
  If f of t is even,</span> <span m=''367000''>then its Fourier series contains only
  the cosine terms.</span> </p><p><span m=''376000''>In other words, half the calculations
  you don''t</span> <span m=''381000''>have to do if you start with an even function.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''386000''>That''s what I mean by shortening the work.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''391000''>There are no odd terms, or let''s put it positively.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''397000''>All the bn''s are zero. Now, one way of doing this</span> <span m=''402000''>would
  be to say, well, y to the bn zero,</span> <span m=''404000''>well, we''ve got formulas,
  and fool around with the</span> <span m=''407000''>formula for the bn, and think
  about a little bit,</span> <span m=''410000''>and finally decide that that has to
  come out to be zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''413000''>That''s not a bad way, and
  it would remind you of some</span> <span m=''416000''>basic facts about integration,
  about integrals.</span> </p><p><span m=''420000''>Instead of doing that, I''m going
  to apply my little</span> <span m=''424000''>principle that if two functions are
  the same,</span> <span m=''428000''>then their Fourier series have to be the same.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''432000''>So, the argument I''m going to give is this,</span> <span
  m=''436000''>so, I''m going to try to prove this statement now.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''440000''>And, I''m going to use the facts on the first board to do it.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''445000''>So, what is f of minus t?</span> </p><p><span m=''450000''>Well,
  if that''s equal to f of t, then in terms of the</span> <span m=''455000''>Fourier
  series, how do I get the Fourier series</span> <span m=''459000''>for f of minus
  t? Well, I take the Fourier series</span> <span m=''464000''>for f of t, and substitute
  t equals minus t.</span> </p><p><span m=''468000''>Now, what happens when I do that?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''471000''>So, the Fourier series for this looks like a zero over
  two</span> <span m=''476000''>plus summation what? Well, the an cosine nt,</span>
  <span m=''482000''>that does not change because when I change t to</span> <span
  m=''486000''>negative t, the cosine nt does</span> <span m=''491000''>not change,
  stays the same because it''s an even function.</span> </p><p><span m=''495000''>What
  happens to the sine term? Well, the sine of negative nt</span> <span m=''500000''>is
  equal to minus the sine of nt.</span> </p><p><span m=''505000''>So, the other terms,
  the sine terms change sign.</span> </p><p><span m=''510000''>So, all that''s the
  result of substituting t for negative t</span> <span m=''514000''>and f of t.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''516000''>On the other hand, what''s f of t itself?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''520000''>Well, f of t itself is what happened before that.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''523000''>Now it''s got a plus sign because nothing was done to the</span> <span
  m=''528000''>series. Well, if the function is even,</span> <span m=''530000''>then
  those two right hand sides are the same function.</span> </p><p><span m=''534000''>In
  other words, they''re like my f of t equals g</span> <span m=''538000''>of t. And
  therefore,</span> <span m=''542000''>the Fourier series on the left must be the
  same.</span> </p><p><span m=''546000''>In other words, if these are equal,</span>
  <span m=''549000''>therefore, these have to be equal, too.</span> </p><p><span m=''553000''>Now,
  there''s no problem with the cosine terms.</span> </p><p><span m=''557000''>They
  look the same. On the other hand,</span> <span m=''560000''>the sine terms have
  changed sign.</span> </p><p><span m=''563000''>Therefore, it must be the case that
  bn is always equal to</span> <span m=''568000''>negative bn for all n. That''s the
  only way this series</span> <span m=''574000''>can be the same as that one. Now,
  if bn is equal to negative</span> <span m=''579000''>bn, that implies that bn is
  zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''583000''>Zero is the only number which</span> <span
  m=''586000''>is equal to its negative. And so, by this argument,</span> <span m=''591000''>in
  other words, using the uniqueness of Fourier</span> <span m=''594000''>series, we
  conclude that if the function is even,</span> <span m=''599000''>then its Fourier
  series can only have cosine terms in it.</span> </p><p><span m=''605000''>Now, you
  say, hey, that''s obvious.</span> </p><p><span m=''607000''>The cosine, that''s
  just a point of logic.</span> </p><p><span m=''609000''>But, this is a mathematics
  course, after all.</span> </p><p><span m=''612000''>It''s not just about calculation.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''614000''>Many of you would say, yeah, of course that''s obvious</span>
  <span m=''618000''>because cosines are even, and the sines are odd.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''621000''>I say, yeah, and so why does that make it</span> <span m=''624000''>true?
  Well, the cosine''s even.</span> </p><p><span m=''625000''>Plus t into minus t,
  and what you are proving</span> <span m=''629000''>is the converse. The converse
  is obvious.</span> </p><p><span m=''633000''>Yeah, obvious, I don''t care.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''635000''>If the right-hand side is the sum of the functions,</span>
  <span m=''639000''>well, so is the left. But I''m saying it the other way</span>
  <span m=''643000''>around. If the left is an even</span> <span m=''645000''>function,
  why does the right-hand side have to have</span> <span m=''649000''>only even terms
  in it? And, this is the argument which</span> <span m=''653000''>makes that true.
  Now, there is a further</span> <span m=''656000''>simplification because if you''ve
  got an even function,</span> <span m=''660000''>oh, by the way, of course the same
  thing is</span> <span m=''663000''>true for the odd, I ought to put that down,</span>
  <span m=''666000''>and so also, if f of t is odd,</span> <span m=''669000''>then
  I think one of these proofs is enough.</span> </p><p><span m=''674000''>The other
  you can supply yourself.</span> </p><p><span m=''677000''>That will imply that all
  the an''s are zero,</span> <span m=''680000''>even including this first one, a zero,</span>
  <span m=''685000''>and by the same reasoning.</span> </p><p><span m=''697000''>So,
  an even function uses only cosines for its Fourier</span> <span m=''701000''>expansion.
  An odd function uses only</span> <span m=''704000''>sines. Good.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''705000''>But, we still have to, suppose we got an even</span> <span m=''709000''>function.
  We''ve still got to calculate</span> <span m=''713000''>this integral. Well, even
  that can be</span> <span m=''716000''>simplified. So, the second stage of the</span>
  <span m=''719000''>simplification, again, assuming that we have an</span> <span
  m=''724000''>even or odd function, and by the way,</span> <span m=''727000''>[LAUGHTER].
  Totally unauthorized.</span> </p><p><span m=''746000''>So, if f of t is even, what
  we''d like to do now is</span> <span m=''754000''>simplify the integral a little.
  And, there is an easy way to do</span> <span m=''763000''>that, because, look, if
  f of t is an even</span> <span m=''769000''>function, then so is f of t cosine nt,</span>
  <span m=''777000''>is also even. Imagine, we could make little</span> <span m=''782000''>rules
  about an even function times an even function is an</span> <span m=''786000''>even
  function. There are general rules of that</span> <span m=''789000''>type, and some
  of you know them, and they are very useful.</span> </p><p><span m=''793000''>But,
  let''s just do it ad hoc here.</span> </p><p><span m=''795000''>If I change t to
  negative t here,</span> <span m=''798000''>I don''t change the function because
  it''s even.</span> </p><p><span m=''801000''>And, I don''t change the cosine because
  that''s even.</span> </p><p><span m=''804000''>So, if I change t to negative t,
  I don''t change the function.</span> </p><p><span m=''808000''>Either factor that
  function, and therefore I don''t change</span> <span m=''812000''>the product of
  those two things either.</span> </p><p><span m=''816000''>So, it''s also even. Now,
  what about an even</span> <span m=''821000''>function when you integrate it? Here''s
  a typical looking even</span> <span m=''828000''>function, let''s say, something
  like,</span> <span m=''832000''>I don''t know, wiggle, wiggle,</span> <span m=''836000''>again.
  Here''s our better even</span> <span m=''839000''>function. All right, so,</span>
  <span m=''842000''>minus pi to pi, even, even though the t-axis is</span> <span
  m=''848000''>somewhat curvy. So, there is an even function.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''854000''>The point is that if you integrate an even function from</span> <span
  m=''857000''>negative pi to pi, I think you all know even from</span> <span m=''861000''>calculus
  you were taught to do this simplification.</span> </p><p><span m=''864000''>Don''t
  do that. Instead, integrate from zero to</span> <span m=''867000''>pi, and double
  the answer. Why should you do that?</span> </p><p><span m=''871000''>The answer
  is because it''s always nice to have zero as one</span> <span m=''875000''>of the
  limits of integration. I trust to your experience,</span> <span m=''879000''>I don''t
  have to sell that. Minus pi is a particularly</span> <span m=''883000''>unpleasant
  lower limit of integration because you are sure</span> <span m=''887000''>to get
  in trouble with negative signs.</span> </p><p><span m=''890000''>There are bound
  to be at least three negative signs floating</span> <span m=''894000''>around. And,
  if you miss one of them,</span> <span m=''897000''>you''ll get the wrong signs of
  answer.</span> </p><p><span m=''901000''>The answer will have the wrong sign.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''903000''>So, the way the formula from this simplifies is that an,</span>
  <span m=''908000''>instead of integrating from negative pi to pi,</span> <span m=''912000''>I
  can integrate only from zero to pi, and double the answer.</span> </p><p><span m=''917000''>So,
  our better formula is this. If the function is even,</span> <span m=''922000''>this
  is the formula you should use: zero to pi,</span> <span m=''926000''>f of t cosine
  nt dt.</span> </p><p><span m=''931000''>Of course, I don''t have to tell</span>
  <span m=''935000''>you what bn should be because bn will be zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''939000''>And, in the same way, if f is odd,</span> <span m=''942000''>the same
  reasoning shows that bn-- of course,</span> <span m=''945000''>an will be zero this
  time. But it will be bn that will be</span> <span m=''950000''>two over pi times
  the integral from zero to pi of f of t sine</span> <span m=''955000''>nt dt.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''960000''>Maybe we''d better just a word</span> <span m=''963000''>about
  that since, why is that so?</span> </p><p><span m=''966000''>If it''s odd, doesn''t
  that mean things become</span> <span m=''968000''>zero? If you integrate an odd</span>
  <span m=''970000''>function like that, the integral over minus pi to</span> <span
  m=''974000''>pi, you get zero. Well, but this is not an odd</span> <span m=''977000''>function.
  This is an odd function,</span> <span m=''979000''>and this is an odd function.
  But the product of two odd</span> <span m=''982000''>functions is an even function.
  Odd times odd is even.</span> </p><p><span m=''986000''>I said I wasn''t going to
  give you those rules,</span> <span m=''989000''>but since this is the one which
  trips everybody up,</span> <span m=''992000''>maybe I''d better say it just justbecause
  it looks wrong.</span> </p><p><span m=''998000''>Right, this is odd. That''s odd.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1000000''>Think about it. If I change t to negative t,</span> <span
  m=''1003000''>this multiplies by minus one.</span> </p><p><span m=''1006000''>This
  multiplies by minus one. And therefore,</span> <span m=''1009000''>the product multiplies
  by minus one times minus one.</span> </p><p><span m=''1014000''>In other words,
  it multiplies by plus one.</span> </p><p><span m=''1017000''>Nothing happens, so
  it stays the same.</span> </p><p><span m=''1021000''>Why does nobody believe this,
  even though it''s true?</span> </p><p><span m=''1024000''>It''s because they are
  thinking about numbers.</span> </p><p><span m=''1028000''>Everybody knows that an
  odd number times an odd number is an</span> <span m=''1032000''>odd number. So,
  I''m not multiplying numbers</span> <span m=''1035000''>here, which also I''ll put
  them in boxes to indicate that they</span> <span m=''1040000''>are not numbers.
  How''s that?</span> </p><p><span m=''1042000''>Brand-new invented notation. The
  box means caution.</span> </p><p><span m=''1045000''>The inside is not a number,
  it''s the word odd or even.</span> </p><p><span m=''1051000''>It''s just a symbolic
  statement that the product of an odd</span> <span m=''1055000''>function and an
  odd function is an even function.</span> </p><p><span m=''1059000''>Even times even
  is even. What''s odd times even?</span> </p><p><span m=''1063000''>Yes, it has to
  get equal time. Obviously, something must come</span> <span m=''1067000''>out to
  be odd, right.</span> </p><p><span m=''1069000''>Okay, so, now that we''ve got our
  two simplifications,</span> <span m=''1073000''>we are ready to do this problem.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1076000''>Instead of attacking it with the original formulas,</span>
  <span m=''1080000''>we are going to think about it and attack it with our better</span>
  <span m=''1084000''>formulas. So, now we are going to</span> <span m=''1091000''>calculate
  the Fourier series for f of t.</span> </p><p><span m=''1099000''>The first thing
  I see, so f of t is our little thing</span> <span m=''1109000''>here. Well, first
  of all,</span> <span m=''1112000''>what kind of function is it: odd, even, or neither?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1115000''>Most functions are neither, of course.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1118000''>But, fortunately in the applications,</span> <span m=''1120000''>functions
  tend to be one or the other.</span> </p><p><span m=''1122000''>Or, they can be converted
  into one to the other.</span> </p><p><span m=''1126000''>Maybe if I get a chance,
  I''ll show you a little how,</span> <span m=''1129000''>or the recitations will.
  So, this function is odd.</span> </p><p><span m=''1132000''>Okay, half the work
  just disappeared.</span> </p><p><span m=''1135000''>I don''t have to calculate any
  an''s.</span> </p><p><span m=''1137000''>They will be zero. So, I only have to calculate</span>
  <span m=''1141000''>bn, and I''ll calculate them by my better formula.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1144000''>So, it''s two over pi times the integral from zero to pi,</span> <span
  m=''1148000''>and what I have to integrate, well, now, finally you''ve got</span>
  <span m=''1151000''>to integrate something. From zero to pi,</span> <span m=''1154000''>this
  is the function, t.</span> </p><p><span m=''1155000''>So, I have to integrate t
  times sine of nt dt.</span> </p><p><span m=''1158000''>Okay,</span> <span m=''1162000''>so
  this is why you learned integration by parts,</span> <span m=''1165000''>one of
  many reasons why you learned integration by parts,</span> <span m=''1169000''>so
  that you wouldn''t have to pull out your little calculators</span> <span m=''1172000''>to
  do this. Okay, now, let''s do it.</span> </p><p><span m=''1176000''>So, it''s two
  over pi.</span> </p><p><span m=''1179000''>Let''s solve that away so we can forget
  about it.</span> </p><p><span m=''1182000''>And, what''s then left is just the evaluation
  of the integral</span> <span m=''1187000''>between limits. So, if I integrate by
  parts,</span> <span m=''1190000''>I''ll want to differentiate the t, and integrate
  the sign,</span> <span m=''1194000''>right? So, the first step is you don''t</span>
  <span m=''1197000''>do the differentiation. You only do the integration.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1202000''>So, that integrates to be cosine nt over n,</span> <span
  m=''1205000''>more or less. The only thing is,</span> <span m=''1208000''>if I differentiate
  this, I get negative sine nt</span> <span m=''1211000''>instead of, so, I want to
  put a negative</span> <span m=''1215000''>sign in front of all this. And, I will
  evaluate that</span> <span m=''1219000''>between the limits, zero and pi,</span>
  <span m=''1221000''>and then subtract what you get by doing both things,</span>
  <span m=''1225000''>both the differentiation and the integration.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1228000''>So, I subtract the integral from zero to pi.</span> </p><p><span m=''1233000''>I
  now differentiate the t, and integrate.</span> </p><p><span m=''1235000''>Well,
  I just did the integration.</span> </p><p><span m=''1237000''>That''s negative cosine
  nt over n.</span> </p><p><span m=''1240000''>You see how the negative signs pile
  up?</span> </p><p><span m=''1243000''>And, if this is negative pi instead of zero,</span>
  <span m=''1245000''>it''s at that point when it starts to lose heart.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1248000''>You see three negative signs, and then when you substitute,</span>
  <span m=''1252000''>you''re going to have to put in still something else negative,</span>
  <span m=''1256000''>and you just have the feeling you''re going to make a mistake.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1261000''>And, you will. Okay, now all we have to do is</span>
  <span m=''1265000''>a little evaluation. Let''s see, at the lower limit I</span>
  <span m=''1269000''>get zero, here. Let''s right away,</span> <span m=''1272000''>as
  two over pi. At the lower limit,</span> <span m=''1276000''>I get zero. That''s
  nice.</span> </p><p><span m=''1278000''>At the upper limit, I get minus pi over
  n times the</span> <span m=''1283000''>cosine of n pi.</span> </p><p><span m=''1286000''>Now,
  once and for all, the cosine of n pi--</span> <span m=''1291000''>If you like to
  make separate steps out of</span> <span m=''1295000''>everything, okay, I''ll let
  you do it this time,</span> <span m=''1299000''>-- -- but in the long run,</span>
  <span m=''1303000''>it''s good to remember that that''s negative one to the n''th</span>
  <span m=''1308000''>power The cosine of pi is minus one .</span> </p><p><span m=''1311000''>The
  cosine of two pi is plus one,</span> <span m=''1315000''>three pi, minus one, and
  so on.</span> </p><p><span m=''1320000''>So, at the upper limit, we get minus pi
  over n,</span> <span m=''1325000''>oh, I didn''t finish the calculation, times the
  cosine of</span> <span m=''1331000''>n pi, which is minus one to the n''th</span>
  <span m=''1337000''>power. And now, how about the other</span> <span m=''1342000''>guy?
  Shall we do in our heads?</span> </p><p><span m=''1346000''>Well, I can do it in
  my head, but I''m not so sure about your</span> <span m=''1352000''>heads. Maybe
  just this once we won''t.</span> </p><p><span m=''1357000''>What is it? It''s plus
  sine nt,</span> <span m=''1361000''>right? So, I combined the two negative</span>
  <span m=''1364000''>signs to a plus sign by putting one this way and the other one</span>
  <span m=''1370000''>that way. And then, if I integrate that</span> <span m=''1373000''>now,
  it''s sine nt divided by n squared,</span> <span m=''1378000''>right? And that''s
  evaluated between</span> <span m=''1382000''>zero and pi. And of course,</span>
  <span m=''1385000''>the sign function vanishes at both ends.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1389000''>So, that part is simply zero. And so, the final answer is</span> <span
  m=''1394000''>that bn is equal to, well, the pi''s cancel.</span> </p><p><span m=''1399000''>This
  minus combines with those n to make one more.</span> </p><p><span m=''1403000''>And
  so, the answer is two over n times minus one to the n plus</span> <span m=''1410000''>first
  power.</span> </p><p><span m=''1415000''>And therefore, the final result is that
  our</span> <span m=''1420000''>Fourier series, the Fourier series for f of t,</span>
  <span m=''1426000''>that funny function is, the Fourier series is</span> <span m=''1433000''>summation
  bn, which is two,</span> <span m=''1436000''>put the two out front because it''s
  in every term.</span> </p><p><span m=''1444000''>There''s no reason to repeat it,
  minus one to the n plus first</span> <span m=''1450000''>power over n times the
  sign of nt.</span> </p><p><span m=''1456000''>That''s summed from one to</span>
  <span m=''1459000''>infinity. Let''s stop and take a look at</span> <span m=''1463000''>that
  for a second. Does that look right?</span> </p><p><span m=''1468000''>Okay, here''s
  our function.</span> </p><p><span m=''1481000''>Here''s our function. What''s the
  first term of this?</span> </p><p><span m=''1488000''>When n is one, this is plus
  one.</span> </p><p><span m=''1494000''>So, the first term is sine t.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1500000''>What''s the next term? When n is two,</span> <span m=''1504000''>this
  is negative. So, it''s minus one to the third</span> <span m=''1508000''>power.
  So, that''s negative one over</span> <span m=''1511000''>two. So, it''s minus one
  half sine</span> <span m=''1513000''>two t, and then it obviously continues</span>
  <span m=''1517000''>in the same way plus a third sign three t.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1521000''>Now, watch carefully because what I''m going to say in the</span>
  <span m=''1524000''>next minute is the heart of Fourier series.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1527000''>I''ve given you that visual to look at to try to reinforce</span>
  <span m=''1531000''>this, but it''s really very important, as you go to the</span>
  <span m=''1534000''>terminal yourself and do that work, simple as it is,</span>
  <span m=''1538000''>and pay attention now. Now, if you think</span> <span m=''1542000''>old-fashioned,
  i.e.</span> </p><p><span m=''1543000''>if you think taylor series, you''re not going
  to believe</span> <span m=''1547000''>this because you will say, well, let''s see,</span>
  <span m=''1550000''>these go on and on. Obviously, it''s the first term</span> <span
  m=''1553000''>that''s the important one. That''s two sine t.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1557000''>Now, the derivative, two sine t, sine t would</span> <span m=''1560000''>exactly
  follow the pink curve. Sine t would look like this.</span> </p><p><span m=''1566000''>Two
  sine t goes up with the wrong angle.</span> </p><p><span m=''1570000''>The first
  term, in other words,</span> <span m=''1572000''>does this. It''s going off with
  the wrong</span> <span m=''1575000''>slope. Now, that''s the whole point of</span>
  <span m=''1578000''>Fourier series. Fourier series is not trying to</span> <span
  m=''1582000''>approximate the function at zero at the central starting point</span>
  <span m=''1587000''>the way Taylor series do. Fourier series tries to treat</span>
  <span m=''1591000''>the whole interval, and approximate the function</span> <span
  m=''1595000''>nicely over the entire interval, in this case,</span> <span m=''1598000''>minus
  pi to pi, as well as possible.</span> </p><p><span m=''1600000''>Taylor series concentrates
  at this point, does it the best it</span> <span m=''1604000''>can at this point.
  Then it tries,</span> <span m=''1606000''>with the next term, to do a little better,</span>
  <span m=''1609000''>and then a little better. The whole philosophy is</span> <span
  m=''1612000''>entirely different. Taylor series are used for</span> <span m=''1615000''>analyzing
  what a function of looks like which you stick close</span> <span m=''1619000''>to
  the base point. Fourier series analyze what a</span> <span m=''1624000''>function
  looks like over the whole interval.</span> </p><p><span m=''1627000''>And, to do
  that, you should therefore aim to,</span> <span m=''1630000''>so the first approximation
  is going to look like that,</span> <span m=''1634000''>going to have entirely the
  wrong slope.</span> </p><p><span m=''1636000''>But, the next one will subtract off
  something which sort of</span> <span m=''1641000''>helps to fix it up. I can''t
  draw this.</span> </p><p><span m=''1643000''>That''s why I''m sending you to the
  visual because the visual</span> <span m=''1647000''>draws them beautifully. And,
  it shows you how each</span> <span m=''1651000''>successive term corrects the Fourier
  series,</span> <span m=''1654000''>and makes the sum a little closer to what you
  started with.</span> </p><p><span m=''1660000''>So, the next guy would, let''s see,
  so it''s 2t.</span> </p><p><span m=''1664000''>So, I''m subtracting off, probably
  I''m just guessing,</span> <span m=''1670000''>but I don''t dare draw this. I haven''t
  prepared to draw it,</span> <span m=''1676000''>and I know I''ll get it wrong. So,
  okay, your exercise.</span> </p><p><span m=''1682000''>But, it''ll look better.
  It''ll go, maybe,</span> <span m=''1687000''>something like, let''s see, it has
  to end up...</span> </p><p><span m=''1692000''>some of it gets subtracted off...</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1697000''>I don''t know what it looks like.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1700000''>When you use the visual at the computer terminal,</span> <span m=''1705000''>I''ve
  asked you to use it three times on a variety of functions.</span> </p><p><span m=''1712000''>I
  think this is maybe even one of them.</span> </p><p><span m=''1714000''>Notice that
  you can set the parameter, you can set the</span> <span m=''1718000''>coefficients
  independently. In other words,</span> <span m=''1721000''>you can go back and correct
  your works, improving the</span> <span m=''1725000''>earlier coefficients, and it
  won''t affect anything</span> <span m=''1728000''>you did before. But, the most
  vivid way to do</span> <span m=''1731000''>it is to try to get, visually, by moving
  the slider,</span> <span m=''1735000''>to try to get the very best value for the
  first coefficient</span> <span m=''1739000''>you can, and look at the curve. Then
  get the very best value</span> <span m=''1745000''>for the second coefficient and
  see how that improves the</span> <span m=''1749000''>approximation, and the third,</span>
  <span m=''1751000''>and so on. And, the point is,</span> <span m=''1753000''>watch
  the approximations approaching the function nicely</span> <span m=''1758000''>over
  the whole interval instead of concentrating all their</span> <span m=''1762000''>goodness
  at the origin the way a Taylor series would.</span> </p><p><span m=''1766000''>Now,
  there is still one mathematical point left.</span> </p><p><span m=''1770000''>It''s
  that equality sign, which is wrong.</span> </p><p><span m=''1775000''>Why is it
  wrong? Well, what I''m saying is that</span> <span m=''1778000''>if I add that the
  series, it adds up to f of t.</span> </p><p><span m=''1783000''>Now, it almost does
  but not quite.</span> </p><p><span m=''1786000''>And, I''d better give you the rule,
  the theorem.</span> </p><p><span m=''1790000''>Of all the theorems in this course
  that aren''t being proved,</span> <span m=''1796000''>this is the one that would
  be most outside the scope of this</span> <span m=''1801000''>course, the one which
  I would most like to prove,</span> <span m=''1805000''>in fact, just because I''m
  a mathematician but wouldn''t dare.</span> </p><p><span m=''1812000''>The theorem
  tells you when a Fourier series converges to the</span> <span m=''1817000''>function
  you started with. And, the essence of it is this.</span> </p><p><span m=''1822000''>If
  f is continuous, is a continuous function,</span> <span m=''1826000''>let''s give
  the point, it''s confusing just to keep</span> <span m=''1830000''>calling it t.
  If you like,</span> <span m=''1832000''>call it t, but I think it would be better
  to call it t zero</span> <span m=''1837000''>just to indicate I''m looking at a
  specific point.</span> </p><p><span m=''1844000''>So, if the function is continuous
  there,</span> <span m=''1848000''>the value of f of t is equal to, the Fourier series</span>
  <span m=''1854000''>converges, and it''s equal to its Fourier series,</span> <span
  m=''1859000''>the sum of the Fourier series at t zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''1865000''>And,
  the fact that I can even use the word sum means that the</span> <span m=''1869000''>Fourier
  series converges. In other words,</span> <span m=''1872000''>when you add up all
  these guys, you don''t go to infinity or get</span> <span m=''1876000''>something
  which just oscillates around crazily.</span> </p><p><span m=''1880000''>They really
  do add up to something.</span> </p><p><span m=''1882000''>Now, if f is not continuous
  at t zero,</span> <span m=''1886000''>this emphatically will not be the case.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1888000''>It will definitely not, but by far, the kinds of</span>
  <span m=''1892000''>discontinuities which occur in the applications are ones like</span>
  <span m=''1896000''>in this picture, where the discontinuities are</span> <span
  m=''1899000''>jump discontinuities. They are almost always jump</span> <span m=''1904000''>discontinuities.
  And, in that case,</span> <span m=''1907000''>in other words, they are isolated.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1909000''>The function looks good here and here, but there''s a
  break.</span> </p><p><span m=''1913000''>Typically, electrical engineers just don''t
  leave a gap because</span> <span m=''1917000''>they like, I don''t know why. But
  electrical engineer,</span> <span m=''1922000''>and others of his or her ilk would
  draw that function like</span> <span m=''1929000''>this, like a rip saw tooth. Even
  those vertical lines have</span> <span m=''1936000''>no meaning whatever, but they
  make people look</span> <span m=''1941000''>happier. So, if f has a jump</span>
  <span m=''1944000''>discontinuity at t zero, and as I said,</span> <span m=''1950000''>that''s
  the most important kind, then f of t,</span> <span m=''1956000''>then the Fourier
  series adds up to, converges to,</span> <span m=''1962000''>it converges, and it
  converges to the mid</span> <span m=''1966000''>point of the jump. Let me just write
  it out in</span> <span m=''1972000''>words like that, the midpoint of the jump.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1975000''>That''s the way we''ll be using it in this course.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1978000''>There''s a notation for this, and it''s in your book.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1982000''>But, those of you who would be interested in such things
  would</span> <span m=''1987000''>know it anyway. So, let''s just call it the</span>
  <span m=''1991000''>midpoint of the jump. So, if I ask you,</span> <span m=''1994000''>to
  what does this converge? In other words,</span> <span m=''1998000''>this series,
  what this shows is that the</span> <span m=''2002000''>series, I''ll write it out
  in the abbreviated form,</span> <span m=''2006000''>summation minus one to the n
  plus one over n sine nt,</span> <span m=''2012000''>what''s the sum of the series?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2019000''>What is it? Let''s call this not</span> <span m=''2021000''>little
  f of t. Let''s call it capital F of t.</span> </p><p><span m=''2024000''>I want
  to know,</span> <span m=''2026000''>what''s the graph of capital F of t?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2028000''>Well, the initial thing is to say, well, it must be the
  same</span> <span m=''2033000''>as the graph of the function you started with.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2036000''>And, my answer is almost, but not quite.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2040000''>In fact, what will its graph look like?</span> </p><p><span m=''2044000''>Well,
  regardless of what definition I made for the</span> <span m=''2049000''>endpoints
  of those pink lines, this function will converge to</span> <span m=''2056000''>the
  following. From here to here,</span> <span m=''2059000''>I''ll draw it. I won''t
  put in minus pi''s.</span> </p><p><span m=''2063000''>I''ll leave that to your imagination.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2067000''>So, there''s a hole at the end here.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2073000''>In other words, the end of the line is not</span> <span m=''2076000''>included.
  And, the end of this line,</span> <span m=''2079000''>regardless of whether it was
  included to start with or not,</span> <span m=''2083000''>it''s not now. And here,
  similarly,</span> <span m=''2086000''>I start it here with a hole, and then go down
  parallel to</span> <span m=''2091000''>the function, t, slope one.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2093000''>And now, how do I fill in, so the missing places,</span> <span m=''2097000''>this
  is the point, pi.</span> </p><p><span m=''2100000''>This is the point, negative
  pi,</span> <span m=''2102000''>and there are similar points as I go out.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2105000''>Well, since the function is continuous here,</span> <span
  m=''2108000''>the Fourier series will converge to this orange line.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2112000''>But here, there''s a jump discontinuity,</span> <span m=''2114000''>and
  therefore, the Fourier series,</span> <span m=''2117000''>this function converges
  to the midpoint of the jump,</span> <span m=''2120000''>in other words, to here.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2122000''>This function, in other words,</span> <span m=''2124000''>converges
  to this very discontinuous looking function,</span> <span m=''2128000''>and rather
  odd how these points are, I say, but in this case,</span> <span m=''2133000''>I
  can prove to you that it converges here by calculating</span> <span m=''2137000''>it.
  Look, this is the point,</span> <span m=''2141000''>pi. What happens when you plug
  in t</span> <span m=''2144000''>equals pi? You get everyone of these terms</span>
  <span m=''2150000''>is zero, and therefore the sum is zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2153000''>So, it certainly converges, and it converges to zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2160000''>Now, that''s a general theorem. It''s rather difficult to prove.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2164000''>You would have to take, again, an analysis course.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2167000''>But, I don''t even get to it in the analysis course which
  I</span> <span m=''2172000''>teach. If I had another semester I''d</span> <span
  m=''2174000''>get to it, but I can''t get everything.</span> </p><p><span m=''2177000''>Anyway,
  we''re not going to get to it this semester to your</span> <span m=''2181000''>infinite
  relief. But, you should know the</span> <span m=''2184000''>theorem anyway. People
  will expect you to know</span> <span m=''2187000''>it. Well, that was half the period,</span>
  <span m=''2192000''>and in the remaining half, you''re going to stay a long</span>
  <span m=''2199000''>time today. Okay, no, don''t panic.</span> </p><p><span m=''2203000''>I
  have to extend the Fourier series.</span> </p><p><span m=''2207000''>Okay, let me
  give you the hurry up version indicating the two</span> <span m=''2214000''>ways
  in which it needs to be extended.</span> </p><p><span m=''2220000''>Extension number
  one --</span> <span m=''2234000''>The period is not two pi, but two times,</span>
  <span m=''2238000''>I''ll keep the two just to make the formulas look as similar
  as</span> <span m=''2244000''>possible to the old ones. The period, let''s say,</span>
  <span m=''2249000''>instead of two pi, is two times L.</span> </p><p><span m=''2254000''>Now,
  I think you know enough mathematics by this point to</span> <span m=''2257000''>sort
  of, I hope you can sort of shrug and say,</span> <span m=''2260000''>well, you know,
  isn''t that just kind of like</span> <span m=''2262000''>changing the units on the
  t-axis?</span> </p><p><span m=''2264000''>You''re just stretching. Yeah, right.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2266000''>All you do is make a change of variable.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2269000''>Now, should we make it nicely? I think I''ll give you the final</span>
  <span m=''2272000''>answer, and then I''ll try to decide while I''m writing it down</span>
  <span m=''2276000''>how much I''ll try to make the argument.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2280000''>First of all, the main thing to get is,</span> <span m=''2284000''>if
  the period is not pi but L, what are the natural versions</span> <span m=''2291000''>of
  the cosine and sine to use? Use the natural functions.</span> </p><p><span m=''2298000''>Natural
  has no meaning, but it''s psychologically</span> <span m=''2303000''>important.
  In other words,</span> <span m=''2306000''>what kind of function should replace
  that?</span> </p><p><span m=''2313000''>I''ll certainly have a t here. What do I
  put in front?</span> </p><p><span m=''2317000''>I''ll keep the n also. The question
  is,</span> <span m=''2320000''>what do I fix? What should I put here in</span> <span
  m=''2323000''>between in order to make the thing come out,</span> <span m=''2327000''>so
  that it has period 2L? You probably should learn to do</span> <span m=''2332000''>this
  formally as well as just sort of psyching it out,</span> <span m=''2336000''>and
  taking a guess, or memorizing the answer.</span> </p><p><span m=''2340000''>If this
  is the t-axis, here is t and L,</span> <span m=''2343000''>zero and L. What you
  want to do is make a</span> <span m=''2348000''>change of variable to the u-axis
  where the axis is the same.</span> </p><p><span m=''2354000''>This is still the
  point. But, L, now,</span> <span m=''2357000''>on the u coordinate, has the name
  pi.</span> </p><p><span m=''2361000''>Now, so I''m just describing a change of variable
  on the axis.</span> </p><p><span m=''2366000''>What''s the one that does this? Well,
  when t is L,</span> <span m=''2371000''>u should be pi. So, t should be L over pi.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2377000''>When u is pi,</span> <span m=''2379000''>t is L, and
  vice versa. How about expressing u in</span> <span m=''2383000''>terms, well, then
  u is equal to pi over L times t.</span> </p><p><span m=''2389000''>That''s the backwards
  form of</span> <span m=''2392000''>writing it, or the forward form, depending upon
  how you like to</span> <span m=''2398000''>think of these things. Okay, so the cosine
  should be</span> <span m=''2405000''>pi over L times t, in order that when t be
  L,</span> <span m=''2410000''>it should be like cosine of n pi,</span> <span m=''2416000''>which
  is what we would have had.</span> </p><p><span m=''2419000''>So, if t is equal to
  L, in other words,</span> <span m=''2425000''>where is this from? What am I trying
  to say?</span> </p><p><span m=''2432000''>That''s the function. This one is probably
  a little</span> <span m=''2436000''>easier to see. Where is this one zero?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2440000''>The sine functions that we used before was zero at zero
  pi,</span> <span m=''2446000''>two pi, three pi. Where is this one zero?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2450000''>It''s zero at zero. When t is equal to L,</span> <span
  m=''2454000''>it''s zero. When t is equal to 2L,</span> <span m=''2458000''>so,
  this is the right thing.</span> </p><p><span m=''2463000''>So, it''s zero. It''s
  periodic,</span> <span m=''2465000''>and it''s zero plus or minus L plus or minus
  2L.</span> </p><p><span m=''2468000''>And, in fact, formally you can verify that</span>
  <span m=''2471000''>it''s periodic with period 2L. So, in other words,</span> <span
  m=''2475000''>we want a Fourier expansion to use these functions as the</span> <span
  m=''2479000''>natural analog of what would be up there.</span> </p><p><span m=''2482000''>So,
  the period of our function is 2L, and the formula is,</span> <span m=''2486000''>I''ll
  give you the formula. It''s f of t equals</span> <span m=''2492000''>identical summation,
  an, except you''ll use these as</span> <span m=''2498000''>the natural functions
  instead of cosine nt and sine</span> <span m=''2505000''>nt. So, n pi t over L</span>
  <span m=''2509000''>plus bn, okay, I''m tired, but I''ll put it in</span> <span
  m=''2514000''>anyway, n pi t over L.</span> </p><p><span m=''2520000''>Yeah, but
  of course, what about the formulas for an?</span> </p><p><span m=''2524000''>Somebody
  up there is watching over us.</span> </p><p><span m=''2528000''>Here are the formulas.
  They are exactly what you would</span> <span m=''2533000''>guess if somebody said
  produce the formulas in ten seconds,</span> <span m=''2539000''>and you''d better
  be right, and you didn''t have time to</span> <span m=''2544000''>calculate. You
  say, well,</span> <span m=''2547000''>it must be, let''s do the cosine series.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2552000''>Okay, let''s not do a cosine. So, it''s one over L</span>
  <span m=''2556000''>times the integral from negative L, in other words,</span> <span
  m=''2561000''>wherever you see an L, wherever you see a pi,</span> <span m=''2565000''>just
  put an L times the f of t cosine, and now we''ll use our</span> <span m=''2570000''>new
  function, not the old one.</span> </p><p><span m=''2572000''>I submit that''s an
  easy, if you know the first formula,</span> <span m=''2577000''>then this would
  be an easy one to remember.</span> </p><p><span m=''2581000''>All you do is change
  pi to L everywhere.</span> </p><p><span m=''2586000''>Except, you got to remember
  this part.</span> </p><p><span m=''2589000''>Make it a function periodic of period
  2L, not 2pi.</span> </p><p><span m=''2595000''>And similarly, bn is similar.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2598000''>It looks just the same way. And, how about,</span> <span
  m=''2602000''>and the same even-odd business goes, too, so that if f of t,</span>
  <span m=''2608000''>for example, is even, and has period 2L,</span> <span m=''2613000''>then
  the function, then the best formula for the</span> <span m=''2618000''>an will not
  be that one. It will be two over L,</span> <span m=''2625000''>and where you integrate
  only from zero to L,</span> <span m=''2629000''>f of t cosine.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2641000''>So, now, the bn''s will be zero, and you''ll just have positive,</span>
  <span m=''2647000''>etc. for L.</span> </p><p><span m=''2648000''>As I say, this
  is important case, particularly if the period</span> <span m=''2653000''>is two,
  in other words, if the half period is one</span> <span m=''2658000''>because in
  the literature, frequently one is used as the</span> <span m=''2664000''>standard
  normal reference, not pi.</span> </p><p><span m=''2667000''>Pi is convenient mathematically
  because it makes the cosines and</span> <span m=''2673000''>sines look simple. But,
  in actual calculation,</span> <span m=''2679000''>it tends to be where L is one.
  So, usually you have a pi here.</span> </p><p><span m=''2685000''>You don''t have
  just nt. Well, I should do a</span> <span m=''2689000''>calculation, but instead
  of doing that, let me give you the</span> <span m=''2695000''>other extension. Fortunately,</span>
  <span m=''2698000''>there are plenty of calculations in your book.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2704000''>So, let me give you in the last couple of minutes the other</span>
  <span m=''2710000''>extension. This is going to be a very</span> <span m=''2714000''>important
  one for us next time. Typically, in applications,</span> <span m=''2721000''>well,
  I mean, the first thing,</span> <span m=''2724000''>periodic functions are nice,
  but let''s face it.</span> </p><p><span m=''2730000''>Most functions aren''t periodic,
  I have to agree.</span> </p><p><span m=''2737000''>So, all this theory is just about
  periodic functions?</span> </p><p><span m=''2740000''>No. It''s about functions.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2742000''>Really, it''s about functions where the interval on which
  you</span> <span m=''2746000''>are interested in them is finite.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2748000''>It''s a finite interval, not functions which go to</span> <span m=''2752000''>infinity.
  For those, you will have to use</span> <span m=''2754000''>Fourier transforms, Fourier
  transforms,</span> <span m=''2757000''>not Fourier series. But, if you are interested
  in a</span> <span m=''2762000''>function on a finite interval, then you can use
  Fourier series</span> <span m=''2766000''>even though the function isn''t periodic
  because you can make it</span> <span m=''2771000''>periodic. So, what you do is,</span>
  <span m=''2773000''>if f of t is on, let''s take the interval from</span> <span
  m=''2777000''>zero to L. That''s a sample finite</span> <span m=''2779000''>interval.
  I can always change the</span> <span m=''2782000''>variable to make the interval
  from zero to L.</span> </p><p><span m=''2785000''>I can even make it from zero to
  one, but that''s a little too</span> <span m=''2789000''>special. It would be a
  little awkward.</span> </p><p><span m=''2794000''>So, if a function is defined on
  a finite interval,</span> <span m=''2798000''>the way to apply the Fourier series
  to it is make a periodic</span> <span m=''2803000''>extension. Now, since I have
  so little</span> <span m=''2807000''>time, I''m just going to get away with murder
  by just drawing</span> <span m=''2812000''>pictures. So, let me give you a function.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2815000''>Here''s my function defined on zero to L, colored chalk
  if you</span> <span m=''2821000''>please. Let''s make it the function t</span> <span
  m=''2825000''>squared, and let''s make L equal to one.</span> </p><p><span m=''2829000''>That
  function is not periodic. If I let it go off,</span> <span m=''2833000''>it would
  just go off to infinity and never repeat its</span> <span m=''2837000''>values,
  except on the left-hand side.</span> </p><p><span m=''2840000''>But, I''m not even
  going to let it be on the left hand side.</span> </p><p><span m=''2845000''>It''s
  only defined from zero to one as far as I''m concerned.</span> </p><p><span m=''2849000''>Okay,
  that function has an even periodic extension.</span> </p><p><span m=''2855000''>And,
  its graph looks like this extended to be an even function.</span> </p><p><span m=''2859000''>Okay,
  now, that means from zero to negative L,</span> <span m=''2864000''>you''ve got
  to make it look exactly as it looked on the</span> <span m=''2868000''>right-hand
  side. Otherwise, it would be even.</span> </p><p><span m=''2871000''>And now, what
  do I do? Well, now I''ve got,</span> <span m=''2874000''>from minus L to L. So,
  all I''m allowed to do is</span> <span m=''2879000''>keep repeating the values.
  In other words,</span> <span m=''2883000''>apply the theory of Fourier series to
  this guy,</span> <span m=''2886000''>use a cosine series because it''s an even function,</span>
  <span m=''2890000''>and then everything you want to do, you say, okay,</span> <span
  m=''2894000''>all the rest of this is garbage.</span> </p><p><span m=''2896000''>I
  only really care about it from here to here.</span> </p><p><span m=''2900000''>And,
  that''s what you will plug into your differential equation</span> <span m=''2904000''>on
  the right-hand side, just that part of it,</span> <span m=''2908000''>just this
  part of it. How about the odd extension?</span> </p><p><span m=''2913000''>What
  would that look like? Okay, the odd extension,</span> <span m=''2917000''>here I
  start like this. And now, to extend it to be an</span> <span m=''2921000''>odd function,
  I have to make it go down in</span> <span m=''2924000''>exactly the same way it
  went up. And, what do I do here?</span> </p><p><span m=''2929000''>I have to make
  it start repeating its values so it will</span> <span m=''2933000''>look like this.
  So, the odd extension is going</span> <span m=''2937000''>to be discontinuous in
  this case.</span> </p><p><span m=''2941000''>And, what''s the Fourier series going
  to converge to?</span> </p><p><span m=''2945000''>Well, in each case, to the average,</span>
  <span m=''2947000''>to the midpoint of the jump, and the odd extension looks</span>
  <span m=''2952000''>like this, and this will give me assigned series.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2956000''>Okay, you''ve got lots of problems to do.</span> </p>'
