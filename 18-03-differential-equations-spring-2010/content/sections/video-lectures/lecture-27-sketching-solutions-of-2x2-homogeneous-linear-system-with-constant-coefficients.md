transcript: <p><span m='0'>As a matter of fact, it plots them very accurately.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3000'>But it is something you also need to learn to do yourself,</span>
  <span m='8000'>as you will see when we study nonlinear equations.</span> </p><p><span
  m='11000'>It is a skill. And since a couple of important</span> <span m='15000'>mathematical
  ideas are involved in it, I think it is a very good</span> <span m='20000'>thing
  to spend just a little time on, one lecture in fact,</span> <span m='24000'>plus
  a little more on the problem set that I will give</span> <span m='28000'>out. The
  last problem set that I</span> <span m='32000'>will give out on Friday. I thought
  it might be a little</span> <span m='36000'>more fun to, again, have a simple-minded
  model.</span> </p><p><span m='40000'>No romance this time. We are going to have
  a little</span> <span m='45000'>model of war, but I have made it sort of</span>
  <span m='48000'>sublimated war. Let's take as the system,</span> <span m='51000'>I
  am going to let two of those be parameters,</span> <span m='55000'>you know, be
  variable, in other words.</span> </p><p><span m='60000'>And the other two I will
  keep fixed, so that you can</span> <span m='65000'>concentrate on them better. I
  will take a and d to be</span> <span m='70000'>negative 1 and negative 3. And the
  other ones we will</span> <span m='75000'>leave open, so let's call this one b times
  y,</span> <span m='79000'>and this other one will be c times x.</span> </p><p><span
  m='96000'>I am going to model this as a fight between two states,</span> <span m='103000'>both
  of which are trying to attract tourists.</span> </p><p><span m='110000'>Let's say
  this is Massachusetts and this will be New Hampshire,</span> <span m='118000'>its
  enemy to the North. Both are busy advertising these</span> <span m='125000'>days
  on television. People are making their summer</span> <span m='128000'>plans. Come
  to New Hampshire,</span> <span m='130000'>you know, New Hampshire has mountains
  and Massachusetts has</span> <span m='134000'>quaint little fishing villages and
  stuff like that.</span> </p><p><span m='144000'>So what are these numbers? Well,
  first of all,</span> <span m='148000'>what do x and y represent? x and y basically
  are the</span> <span m='153000'>advertising budgets for tourism, you know, the amount
  each state</span> <span m='159000'>plans to spend during the year. However, I do
  not want zero</span> <span m='165000'>value to mean they are not spending anything.</span>
  </p><p><span m='169000'>It represents departure from the normal equilibrium.</span>
  </p><p><span m='174000'>x and y represent departures --</span> <span m='184000'>--
  from the normal amount of money they spend advertising for</span> <span m='189000'>tourists.
  The normal tourist advertising</span> <span m='193000'>budget.</span> </p><p><span
  m='200000'>If they are both zero, it means that both states are</span> <span m='203000'>spending
  what they normally spend in that year.</span> </p><p><span m='206000'>If x is positive,
  it means that Massachusetts has</span> <span m='209000'>decided to spend more in
  the hope of attracting more tourists</span> <span m='213000'>and if negative spending
  less. What is the significance of</span> <span m='217000'>these two coefficients?
  Those are the normal things</span> <span m='221000'>which return you to equilibrium.
  In other words,</span> <span m='224000'>if x gets bigger than normal, if Massachusetts
  spends more</span> <span m='228000'>there is a certain poll to spend less because
  we are wasting all</span> <span m='233000'>this money on the tourists that are not
  going to come when we</span> <span m='237000'>could be spending it on education
  or something like</span> <span m='240000'>that. If x gets to be negative,</span>
  <span m='243000'>the governor tries to spend less.</span> </p><p><span m='245000'>Then
  all the local city Chamber of Commerce rise up and start</span> <span m='249000'>screaming
  that our economy is going to go bankrupt because we</span> <span m='253000'>won't
  get enough tourists and that is because you are not</span> <span m='256000'>spending
  enough money. There is a push to always</span> <span m='259000'>return it to the
  normal, and that is what this negative</span> <span m='262000'>sign means. The same
  thing for New</span> <span m='264000'>Hampshire. What does it mean that this is</span>
  <span m='267000'>negative three and that is negative one?</span> </p><p><span m='271000'>It
  just means that the Chamber of Commerce yells three times as</span> <span m='276000'>loudly
  in New Hampshire. It is more sensitive,</span> <span m='280000'>in other words,
  to changes in the budget.</span> </p><p><span m='284000'>Now, how about the other?
  Well, these represent the</span> <span m='288000'>war-like features of the situation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='291000'>Normally these will be positive numbers.</span> </p><p><span
  m='296000'>Because when Massachusetts sees that New Hampshire has budgeted</span>
  <span m='300000'>this year more than its normal amount, the natural instinct is</span>
  <span m='305000'>we are fighting. This is war.</span> </p><p><span m='308000'>This
  is a positive number. We have to budget more,</span> <span m='312000'>too. And the
  same thing for New</span> <span m='314000'>Hampshire. The size of these coefficients</span>
  <span m='317000'>gives you the magnitude of the reaction.</span> </p><p><span m='320000'>If
  they are small Massachusetts say, well, they are spending</span> <span m='325000'>more
  but we don't have to follow them.</span> </p><p><span m='330000'>We will bucket
  a little bit. If it is a big number then oh,</span> <span m='334000'>my God, heads
  will roll. We have to triple them and put</span> <span m='338000'>them out of business.
  This is a model,</span> <span m='341000'>in fact, for all sorts of competition.</span>
  </p><p><span m='344000'>It was used for many years to model in simper times armaments</span>
  <span m='349000'>races between countries. It is certainly a simple-minded</span>
  <span m='353000'>model for any two companies in competition with each other if</span>
  <span m='358000'>certain conditions are met. Well, what I would like to do</span>
  <span m='365000'>now is try different values of those numbers.</span> </p><p><span
  m='370000'>And, in each case, show you how to sketch the</span> <span m='375000'>solutions
  at different cases. And then, for each different</span> <span m='382000'>case, we
  will try to interpret if it makes sense or not.</span> </p><p><span m='390000'>My
  first set of numbers is, the first case is --</span> <span m='403000'>-- x prime
  equals negative x plus 2y.</span> </p><p><span m='409000'>And y prime equals, this
  is going to be zero,</span> <span m='414000'>so it is simply minus 3 times y.</span>
  </p><p><span m='420000'>Now, what does this mean? Well, this means that</span> <span
  m='424000'>Massachusetts is behaving normally, but New Hampshire is a</span> <span
  m='428000'>very placid state, and the governor is busy doing</span> <span m='433000'>other
  things. And people say Massachusetts is</span> <span m='437000'>spending more this
  year, and the Governor says,</span> <span m='441000'>so what. The zero is the so
  what factor.</span> </p><p><span m='444000'>In other words, we are not going to
  respond to</span> <span m='448000'>them. We will do our own thing.</span> </p><p><span
  m='451000'>What is the result of this? Is Massachusetts going to win</span> <span
  m='455000'>out? What is going to be the</span> <span m='457000'>ultimate effect
  on the budget? Well, what we have to do is,</span> <span m='460000'>so the program
  is first let's quickly solve the equations</span> <span m='464000'>using a standard
  technique. I am just going to make marks</span> <span m='468000'>on the board and
  trust to the fact that you have done enough</span> <span m='472000'>of this yourself
  by now that you know what the marks mean.</span> </p><p><span m='477000'>I am not
  going to label what everything is.</span> </p><p><span m='480000'>I am just going
  to trust to luck.</span> </p><p><span m='483000'>The matrix A is negative 1, 2,
  0, negative 3.</span> </p><p><span m='487000'>The characteristic equation,</span>
  <span m='491000'>the second coefficient is the trace, which is minus 4,</span> <span
  m='495000'>but you have to change its sign, so that makes it plus 4.</span> </p><p><span
  m='500000'>And the constant term is the determinant, which is 3 minus 0,</span>
  <span m='505000'>so that is plus 3 equals zero. This factors into lambda plus 3</span>
  <span m='511000'>times lambda plus one. And it means the roots</span> <span m='515000'>therefore
  are, one root is lambda equals</span> <span m='518000'>negative 3 and the other
  root is lambda equals negative 1.</span> </p><p><span m='523000'>These are the eigenvalues.
  With each eigenvalue goes an</span> <span m='527000'>eigenvector. The eigenvector
  is found by</span> <span m='531000'>solving an equation for the coefficients of
  the eigenvector,</span> <span m='536000'>the components of the eigenvector.</span>
  </p><p><span m='540000'>Here I used negative 1 minus negative 3, which makes 2.</span>
  </p><p><span m='544000'>The first equation is 2a1 plus 2a2 is equal to zero.</span>
  </p><p><span m='549000'>The second one will be, in fact, in this case simply</span>
  <span m='554000'>0a1 plus 0a2 so it won't give me any information at all.</span>
  </p><p><span m='558000'>That is not what usually happens, but it is what happens</span>
  <span m='563000'>in this case. What is the solution?</span> </p><p><span m='568000'>The
  solution is the vector alpha equals,</span> <span m='572000'>well, 1, negative 1
  would be a good thing to</span> <span m='577000'>use. That is the eigenvector,</span>
  <span m='580000'>so this is the e-vector. How about lambda equals</span> <span m='585000'>negative
  1? Let's give it a little more</span> <span m='589000'>room. If lambda is negative
  1 then</span> <span m='592000'>here I put negative 1 minus negative 1.</span> </p><p><span
  m='596000'>That makes zero. I will write in the zero</span> <span m='601000'>because
  this is confusing. It is zero times a1.</span> </p><p><span m='604000'>And the next
  coefficient is 2 a2, is zero.</span> </p><p><span m='607000'>People sometimes go
  bananas over this, in spite of the fact</span> <span m='611000'>that this is the
  easiest possible case you can get.</span> </p><p><span m='615000'>I guess if they
  go bananas over it, it proves it is not all that</span> <span m='619000'>easy, but
  it is easy. What now is the eigenvector</span> <span m='622000'>that goes with this?
  Well, this term isn't there.</span> </p><p><span m='626000'>It is zero. The equation
  says that a2 has</span> <span m='630000'>to be zero. And it doesn't say anything</span>
  <span m='632000'>about a1, so let's make it 1.</span> </p><p><span m='640000'>Now,
  out of this data, the final step is to make the</span> <span m='644000'>general
  solution. What is it?</span> </p><p><span m='647000'>(x, y) equals, well, a constant
  times the</span> <span m='651000'>first normal mode. The solution constructed from</span>
  <span m='655000'>the eigenvalue and the eigenvector.</span> </p><p><span m='660000'>That
  is going to be 1, negative 1 e to the minus 3t.</span> </p><p><span m='664000'>And
  then the other normal mode</span> <span m='668000'>times an arbitrary constant will
  be (1, 0) times e to the</span> <span m='672000'>negative t.</span> </p><p><span
  m='674000'>The lambda is this factor which produces that,</span> <span m='678000'>of
  course. Now, one way of looking at it</span> <span m='681000'>is, first of all,
  get clearly in your head this</span> <span m='685000'>is a pair of parametric equations
  just like what you</span> <span m='689000'>studied in 18.02. Let's write them out
  explicitly</span> <span m='694000'>just this once. x equals c1 times e to the</span>
  <span m='698000'>negative 3t plus c2 times e to the negative t.</span> </p><p><span
  m='704000'>And what is y?</span> </p><p><span m='707000'>y is equal to minus c1
  e to the minus 3t plus zero.</span> </p><p><span m='712000'>I can stop there.</span>
  </p><p><span m='715000'>In some sense, all I am asking you to do is</span> <span
  m='719000'>plot that curve. In the x,y-plane,</span> <span m='723000'>plot the curve
  given by this pair of parametric equations.</span> </p><p><span m='727000'>And you
  can choose your own values of c1,</span> <span m='730000'>c2. For different values
  of c1 and</span> <span m='732000'>c2 there will be different curves.</span> </p><p><span
  m='735000'>Give me a feeling for what they all look like.</span> </p><p><span m='738000'>Well,
  I think most of you will recognize you didn't have stuff</span> <span m='742000'>like
  this. These weren't the kind of</span> <span m='745000'>curves you plotted. When
  you did parametric</span> <span m='749000'>equations in 18.02, you did stuff like
  x equals</span> <span m='752000'>cosine t, y equals sine t.</span> </p><p><span
  m='756000'>Everybody knows how to do that. A few other curves which made</span>
  <span m='760000'>lines or nice things, but nothing that ever looked</span> <span
  m='763000'>like that. And so the computer will plot</span> <span m='765000'>it by
  actually calculating values but, of course,</span> <span m='768000'>we will not.
  That is the significance of the</span> <span m='771000'>word sketch. I am not asking
  you to plot</span> <span m='774000'>carefully, but to give me some general geometric
  picture of</span> <span m='778000'>what all these curves look like without doing
  any work.</span> </p><p><span m='783000'>Without doing any work. Well, that sounds
  promising.</span> </p><p><span m='789000'>Okay, let's try to do it without doing
  any work.</span> </p><p><span m='796000'>Where shall I begin? Hidden in this formula
  are four</span> <span m='803000'>solutions that are extremely easy to plot.</span>
  </p><p><span m='810000'>So begin with the four easy solutions, and then fill in
  the</span> <span m='818000'>rest. Now, which are the easy</span> <span m='822000'>solutions?
  The easy solutions are c1</span> <span m='827000'>equals plus or minus 1, c2 equals
  zero,</span> <span m='833000'>or c1 equals zero, or c1 = 0, c2 equals plus or</span>
  <span m='840000'>minus 1. By choosing those four values</span> <span m='845000'>of
  c1 and c2, I get simple solutions</span> <span m='847000'>corresponding to the normal
  mode.</span> </p><p><span m='850000'>If c1 is one and c2 is zero, I am talking about
  (1,</span> <span m='854000'>negative 1) e to the minus 3t,</span> <span m='857000'>and
  that is very easy plot. Let's start plotting them.</span> </p><p><span m='861000'>What
  I am going to do is color-code them so you will be</span> <span m='865000'>able
  to recognize what it is I am plotting.</span> </p><p><span m='870000'>Let's see.
  What colors should we use?</span> </p><p><span m='873000'>We will use pink and orange.
  This will be our pink solution</span> <span m='879000'>and our orange solution will
  be this one.</span> </p><p><span m='883000'>Let's plot the pink solution first.</span>
  </p><p><span m='887000'>The pink solution corresponds to c1 equals 1 and c2</span>
  <span m='893000'>equals zero. Now, that solution looks like--</span> <span m='898000'>Let's
  write it in pink.</span> </p><p><span m='901000'>No, let's not write it in pink.
  What is the solution?</span> </p><p><span m='906000'>It looks like x equals e to
  the negative 3t,</span> <span m='911000'>y equals minus e to the minus 3t.</span>
  </p><p><span m='915000'>Well, that's not a good way to look at it, actually.</span>
  </p><p><span m='919000'>The best way to look at it is to say at t equals zero,</span>
  <span m='924000'>where is it? It is at the point 1,</span> <span m='926000'>negative
  1.</span> </p><p><span m='930000'>And what is it doing as t increases?</span> </p><p><span
  m='932000'>Well, it keeps the direction, but travels.</span> </p><p><span m='935000'>The
  amplitude, the distance from the origin</span> <span m='939000'>keeps shrinking.
  As t increases,</span> <span m='941000'>this factor, so it is the tip of this</span>
  <span m='944000'>vector, except the vector is shrinking.</span> </p><p><span m='947000'>It
  is still in the direction of 1, negative 1,</span> <span m='951000'>but it is shrinking
  in length because its amplitude is</span> <span m='955000'>shrinking according to
  the law e to the negative 3t.</span> </p><p><span m='962000'>In other words, this
  curve looks like this.</span> </p><p><span m='965000'>At t equals zero it is over
  here, and it goes along this</span> <span m='969000'>diagonal line until as t equals
  infinity, it gets to infinity,</span> <span m='974000'>it reaches the origin. Of
  course, it never gets there.</span> </p><p><span m='978000'>It goes slower and slower
  and slower in order that it may</span> <span m='983000'>never reach the origin.
  What was it doing for values of</span> <span m='987000'>t less than zero? The same
  thing,</span> <span m='991000'>except it was further away. It comes in from infinity
  along</span> <span m='995000'>that straight line. In other words,</span> <span m='997000'>the
  eigenvector determines the line on which it travels and the</span> <span m='1001000'>eigenvalue
  determines which way it goes.</span> </p><p><span m='1004000'>If the eigenvalue
  is negative, it is approaching the origin as</span> <span m='1008000'>t increases.
  How about the other one?</span> </p><p><span m='1011000'>Well, if c1 is negative
  1, then everything is the</span> <span m='1015000'>same except it is the mirror
  image of this one.</span> </p><p><span m='1020000'>If c1 is negative 1, then at
  t equals zero it is at</span> <span m='1023000'>this point. And, once again,</span>
  <span m='1025000'>the same reasoning shows that it is coming into the origin as</span>
  <span m='1030000'>t increases. I have now two solutions,</span> <span m='1032000'>this
  one corresponding to c1 equals 1,</span> <span m='1036000'>and the other one c2
  equals zero.</span> </p><p><span m='1039000'>This one corresponds to c1 equals negative
  1.</span> </p><p><span m='1042000'>How about the other guy, the orange guy?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1045000'>Well, now c1 is zero, c2 is one, let's say.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1050000'>It is the vector (1, 0), but otherwise everything is</span> <span m='1053000'>the
  same. I start now at the point (1,</span> <span m='1056000'>0) at time zero. And,
  as t increases,</span> <span m='1059000'>I come into the origin always along that
  direction.</span> </p><p><span m='1062000'>And before that I came in from infinity.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1065000'>And, again, if c2 is 1 and if c2 is negative 1,</span>
  <span m='1070000'>I do the same thing but on the other side.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1080000'>That wasn't very hard. I plotted four solutions.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1084000'>And now I roll up my sleeves and waive my hands to try to get</span>
  <span m='1090000'>others. The general philosophy is the</span> <span m='1094000'>following.
  The general philosophy is the</span> <span m='1098000'>differential equation looks
  like this.</span> </p><p><span m='1101000'>It is a system of differential equations.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1105000'>These are continuous functions. That means when I draw
  the</span> <span m='1111000'>velocity field corresponding to that system of differential</span>
  <span m='1116000'>equations, because their functions are continuous,</span> <span
  m='1119000'>as I move from one (x, y) point to another the</span> <span m='1123000'>direction
  of the velocity vectors change continuously.</span> </p><p><span m='1126000'>It
  never suddenly reverses without something like that.</span> </p><p><span m='1130000'>Now,
  if that changes continuously then the</span> <span m='1133000'>trajectories must
  change continuously,</span> <span m='1136000'>too. In other words,</span> <span
  m='1139000'>nearby trajectories should be doing approximately the same</span> <span
  m='1143000'>thing. Well, that means all the other</span> <span m='1145000'>trajectories
  are ones which come like that must be going also</span> <span m='1150000'>toward
  the origin. If I start here,</span> <span m='1152000'>probably I have to follow
  this one.</span> </p><p><span m='1155000'>They are all coming to the origin, but
  that is a little too</span> <span m='1159000'>vague. How do they come to the origin?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1162000'>In other words, are they coming in straight</span> <span
  m='1165000'>like that? Probably not.</span> </p><p><span m='1166000'>Then what are
  they doing? Now we are coming to the only</span> <span m='1172000'>point in the
  lecture which you might find a little difficult.</span> </p><p><span m='1176000'>Try
  to follow what I am doing now.</span> </p><p><span m='1178000'>If you don't follow,
  it is not well done in the</span> <span m='1182000'>textbook, but it is very well
  done in the notes because I</span> <span m='1186000'>wrote them myself. Please,
  it is done very</span> <span m='1189000'>carefully in the notes, patiently follow
  through the</span> <span m='1192000'>explanation. It takes about that much space.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1195000'>It is one of the important ideas that your engineering</span>
  <span m='1199000'>professors will expect you to understand.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1204000'>Anyway, I know this only from the negative one because they</span> <span
  m='1208000'>say to me at lunch, ruin my lunch by saying I said</span> <span m='1212000'>it
  to my students and got nothing but blank looks.</span> </p><p><span m='1216000'>What
  do you guys teach them over there?</span> </p><p><span m='1219000'>Blah, blah, blah.
  Maybe we ought to start</span> <span m='1222000'>teaching it ourselves. Sure.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1225000'>Why don't they start cutting their own hair,</span> <span
  m='1228000'>too?</span> </p><p><span m='1235000'>Here is the idea. Let me recopy
  that solution.</span> </p><p><span m='1240000'>The solution looks like (1, negative
  1) e to the minus 3t</span> <span m='1246000'>plus c2, (1, 0) e to the negative
  t.</span> </p><p><span m='1256000'>What I ask is as t goes to infinity, I feel sure
  that the</span> <span m='1260000'>trajectories must be coming into the origin because
  these guys</span> <span m='1264000'>are doing that. And, in fact,</span> <span m='1266000'>that
  is confirmed. As t goes to infinity,</span> <span m='1269000'>this goes to zero
  and that goes to zero regardless of what the</span> <span m='1273000'>c1 and c2
  are. That makes it clear that this</span> <span m='1277000'>goes to zero no matter
  what the c1 and c2 are as t goes to</span> <span m='1281000'>infinity, but I would
  like to analyze it a little more</span> <span m='1285000'>carefully. As t goes to
  infinity,</span> <span m='1288000'>I have the sum of two terms. And what I ask is,</span>
  <span m='1292000'>which term is dominant? Of these two terms,</span> <span m='1296000'>are
  they of equal importance, or is one more important than</span> <span m='1301000'>the
  other? When t is 10,</span> <span m='1303000'>for example, that is not very far
  on the way</span> <span m='1307000'>to infinity, but it is certainly far enough
  to illustrate.</span> </p><p><span m='1312000'>Well, e to the minus 10 is an extremely</span>
  <span m='1316000'>small number. The only thing smaller is e to</span> <span m='1321000'>the
  minus 30. The term that dominates,</span> <span m='1325000'>they are both small,
  but relatively-speaking this</span> <span m='1328000'>one is much larger because
  this one only has the factor e to the</span> <span m='1333000'>minus 10, whereas,
  this has the factor e</span> <span m='1337000'>to the minus 30, which is vanishingly
  small.</span> </p><p><span m='1342000'>In other words, as t goes to infinity --</span>
  <span m='1346000'>Well, let's write it the other way.</span> </p><p><span m='1348000'>This
  is the dominant term, as t goes to infinity.</span> </p><p><span m='1358000'>Now,
  just the opposite is true as t goes to minus infinity.</span> </p><p><span m='1363000'>t
  going to minus infinity means I am backing up along these</span> <span m='1368000'>curves.
  As t goes to minus infinity,</span> <span m='1371000'>let's say t gets to be negative
  100, this is e to the 100,</span> <span m='1376000'>but this is e to the 300,</span>
  <span m='1381000'>which is much, much bigger.</span> </p><p><span m='1383000'>So
  this is the dominant term as t goes to negative infinity.</span> </p><p><span m='1398000'>Now
  what I have is the sum of two vectors.</span> </p><p><span m='1400000'>Let's first
  look at what happens as t goes to infinity.</span> </p><p><span m='1404000'>As t
  goes to infinity, I have the sum of two vectors.</span> </p><p><span m='1408000'>This
  one is completely negligible compared with the one</span> <span m='1411000'>on the
  right-hand side. In other words,</span> <span m='1415000'>for a all intents and
  purposes, as t goes to infinity,</span> <span m='1418000'>it is this thing that
  takes over.</span> </p><p><span m='1421000'>Therefore, what does the solution look
  like as t goes to</span> <span m='1425000'>infinity? The answer is it follows the</span>
  <span m='1427000'>yellow line. Now, what does it look like as</span> <span m='1430000'>it
  backs up? As it came in from negative</span> <span m='1433000'>infinity, what does
  it look like?</span> </p><p><span m='1436000'>Now, this one is a little harder to
  see.</span> </p><p><span m='1440000'>This is big, but this is infinity bigger.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1443000'>I mean very, very much bigger,</span> <span m='1446000'>when
  t is a large negative number.</span> </p><p><span m='1449000'>Therefore, what I
  have is the sum of a very big vector.</span> </p><p><span m='1454000'>You're standing
  on the moon looking at the blackboard,</span> <span m='1459000'>so this is really
  big. This is a very big vector.</span> </p><p><span m='1464000'>This is one million
  meters long, and this is only 20</span> <span m='1469000'>meters long. That is this
  guy,</span> <span m='1473000'>and that is this guy. I want the sum of those two.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1476000'>What does the sum look like? The answer is a sum is</span>
  <span m='1480000'>approximately parallel to the long guy because this is</span>
  <span m='1484000'>negligible. This does not mean they are</span> <span m='1487000'>next
  to each other. They are slightly tilted over,</span> <span m='1491000'>but not very
  much. In other words,</span> <span m='1493000'>as t goes to negative infinity it
  doesn't coincide with this</span> <span m='1498000'>vector. The solution doesn't,</span>
  <span m='1501000'>but it is parallel to it. It has the same direction.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1505000'>I am done. It means far away from the</span> <span m='1507000'>origin,
  it should be parallel to the pink line.</span> </p><p><span m='1511000'>Near the
  origin it should turn and become more or less</span> <span m='1515000'>coincident
  with the orange line. And those were the solutions.</span> </p><p><span m='1519000'>That's
  how they look.</span> </p><p><span m='1527000'>How about down here? The same thing,</span>
  <span m='1530000'>like that, but then after a while they turn and join.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1535000'>Here, they have to turn around to join up, but they join.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1541000'>And that is, in a simple way,</span> <span m='1544000'>the sketches
  of those functions.</span> </p><p><span m='1547000'>That is how they must look.
  What does this say about our</span> <span m='1553000'>state? Well, it says that
  the fact</span> <span m='1557000'>that the governor of New Hampshire is indifferent
  to what</span> <span m='1561000'>Massachusetts is doing produces ultimately harmony.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1566000'>Both states revert ultimately their normal advertising
  budgets</span> <span m='1571000'>in spite of the fact that Massachusetts is keeping
  an eye</span> <span m='1575000'>peeled out for the slightest misbehavior on the
  part of New</span> <span m='1580000'>Hampshire. Peace reins,</span> <span m='1582000'>in
  other words. Now you should know some names.</span> </p><p><span m='1587000'>Let's
  see. I will write names in purple.</span> </p><p><span m='1590000'>There are two
  words that are used to describe this situation.</span> </p><p><span m='1595000'>First
  is the word that describes the general pattern of</span> <span m='1600000'>the way
  these lines look. The word for that is a node.</span> </p><p><span m='1604000'>And
  the fact that all the trajectories end up at the</span> <span m='1608000'>origin
  for that one uses the word sink.</span> </p><p><span m='1612000'>This could be modified
  to nodal sink.</span> </p><p><span m='1615000'>That would be better. Nodal sink,
  let's say.</span> </p><p><span m='1620000'>Nodal sink or, if you like to write them
  in</span> <span m='1623000'>the opposite order, sink node.</span> </p><p><span m='1626000'>In
  the same way there would be something called a source node</span> <span m='1631000'>if
  I reversed all the arrows. I am not going to calculate an</span> <span m='1636000'>example.
  Why don't I simply do it by</span> <span m='1639000'>giving you -- For example,</span>
  <span m='1643000'>if the matrix A produced a solution instead of that one.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1648000'>Suppose it looked like 1, negative 1 e to the 3t.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1652000'>The eigenvalues were reversed,</span> <span m='1656000'>were
  now positive. And I will make the other one</span> <span m='1661000'>positive, too.
  c2 1, 0 e to the t.</span> </p><p><span m='1677000'>What would that change in the
  picture?</span> </p><p><span m='1679000'>The answer is essentially nothing, except
  the direction of</span> <span m='1684000'>the arrows. In other words,</span> <span
  m='1686000'>the first thing would still be 1, negative 1.</span> </p><p><span m='1689000'>The
  only difference is that now</span> <span m='1692000'>as t increases we go the other
  way.</span> </p><p><span m='1695000'>And here the same thing, we have still the
  same basic</span> <span m='1699000'>vector, the same basic orange vector, orange
  line,</span> <span m='1702000'>but it has now traversed the solution.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1705000'>We traverse it in the opposite direction.</span> </p><p><span m='1710000'>Now,
  let's do the same thing about dominance,</span> <span m='1715000'>as we did before.
  Which term dominates as t goes</span> <span m='1720000'>to infinity? This is the
  dominant term.</span> </p><p><span m='1724000'>Because, as t goes to infinity, 3t
  is much bigger than t.</span> </p><p><span m='1731000'>This one, on the other hand,
  dominates as t goes to negative</span> <span m='1737000'>infinity.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1745000'>How now will the solutions look like?</span> </p><p><span m='1747000'>Well,
  as t goes to infinity, they follow the pink curve.</span> </p><p><span m='1751000'>Whereas,
  as t starts out from negative infinity,</span> <span m='1755000'>they follow the
  orange curve.</span> </p><p><span m='1768000'>As t goes to infinity, they become
  parallel to the</span> <span m='1773000'>pink curve, and as t goes to negative infinity,</span>
  <span m='1778000'>they are very close to the origin and are following the</span>
  <span m='1784000'>yellow curve. This is pink and this is</span> <span m='1788000'>yellow.
  They look like this.</span> </p><p><span m='1803000'>Notice the picture basically
  is the same.</span> </p><p><span m='1806000'>It is the picture of a node. All that
  has happened is the</span> <span m='1811000'>arrows are reversed. And, therefore,</span>
  <span m='1814000'>this would be called a nodal source.</span> </p><p><span m='1817000'>The
  word source and sink correspond to what you learned</span> <span m='1821000'>in
  18.02 and 8.02, I hope, also,</span> <span m='1824000'>or you could call it a source
  node.</span> </p><p><span m='1827000'>Both phrases are used, depending on how you
  want to</span> <span m='1831000'>use it in a sentence. And another word for this,</span>
  <span m='1837000'>this would be called unstable because all of the solutions</span>
  <span m='1841000'>starting out from near the origin ultimately end up</span> <span
  m='1845000'>infinitely far away from the origin.</span> </p><p><span m='1847000'>This
  would be called stable. In fact, it would be called</span> <span m='1852000'>asymptotically
  stable. I don't like the word</span> <span m='1855000'>asymptotically, but it has
  become standard in</span> <span m='1858000'>the literature. And, more important,</span>
  <span m='1862000'>it is standard in your textbook.</span> </p><p><span m='1865000'>And
  I don't like to fight with a textbook.</span> </p><p><span m='1868000'>It just ends
  up confusing everybody, including me.</span> </p><p><span m='1872000'>That is enough
  for nodes. I would like to talk now about</span> <span m='1876000'>some of the other
  cases that can occur because they lead to</span> <span m='1881000'>completely different
  pictures that you should understand.</span> </p><p><span m='1886000'>Let's look
  at the case where our governors behave a little</span> <span m='1890000'>more badly,
  a little more combatively.</span> </p><p><span m='1900000'>It is x prime equals
  negative x as before,</span> <span m='1906000'>but this time a firm response by
  Massachusetts to any sign of</span> <span m='1912000'>increased activity by stockpiling
  of advertising</span> <span m='1918000'>budgets. Here let's say New Hampshire</span>
  <span m='1923000'>now is even worse. Five times, quintuple or</span> <span m='1928000'>whatever
  increase Massachusetts makes, of course they don't have</span> <span m='1935000'>an
  income tax, but they will manage.</span> </p><p><span m='1939000'>Minus 3y as before.
  Let's again calculate quickly</span> <span m='1944000'>what the characteristic equation
  is.</span> </p><p><span m='1950000'>Our matrix is now negative 1, 3, 5 and negative
  3.</span> </p><p><span m='1954000'>The characteristic equation now</span> <span
  m='1957000'>is lambda squared. What is that?</span> </p><p><span m='1960000'>Again,
  plus 4 lambda. But now the determinant is 3</span> <span m='1964000'>minus 15 is
  negative 12.</span> </p><p><span m='1968000'>And this, because I prepared very carefully,</span>
  <span m='1972000'>all eigenvalues are integers. And so this factors into lambda</span>
  <span m='1977000'>plus 6 times lambda minus 2,</span> <span m='1981000'>does it
  not? Yes.</span> </p><p><span m='1984000'>6 lambda minus 2 is four lambda.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1987000'>Good. What do we have?</span> </p><p><span m='1990000'>Well,
  first of all we have our eigenvalue lambda,</span> <span m='1995000'>negative 6.
  And the eigenvector that goes</span> <span m='1999000'>with that is minus 1. This
  is negative 1 minus</span> <span m='2004000'>negative 6 which makes, shut your eyes,</span>
  <span m='2008000'>5. We have 5a1 plus 3a2 is zero.</span> </p><p><span m='2012000'>And
  the other equation,</span> <span m='2015000'>I hope it comes out to be something
  similar.</span> </p><p><span m='2018000'>I didn't check. I am hoping this is right.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2022000'>The eigenvector is, okay, you have been taught to</span>
  <span m='2026000'>always make one of the 1, forget about that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2029000'>Just pick numbers that make it come out right.</span> </p><p><span m='2033000'>I
  am going to make this one 3, and then I will make this one</span> <span m='2037000'>negative
  5. As I say, I have a policy of</span> <span m='2042000'>integers only. I am a number
  theorist at</span> <span m='2046000'>heart. That is how I started out life</span>
  <span m='2049000'>anyway. There we have data from which</span> <span m='2052000'>we
  can make one solution. How about the other one?</span> </p><p><span m='2057000'>The
  other one will correspond to the eigenvalue lambda equals</span> <span m='2063000'>2.
  This time the equation is</span> <span m='2065000'>negative 1 minus 2 is negative
  3.</span> </p><p><span m='2070000'>It is minus 3a1 plus 3a2 is zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2074000'>And now the eigenvector is (1, 1).</span> </p><p><span m='2077000'>Now
  we are ready to draw pictures.</span> </p><p><span m='2080000'>We are going to make
  this similar analysis,</span> <span m='2084000'>but it will go faster now because
  you have already had the</span> <span m='2089000'>experience of that. First of all,</span>
  <span m='2092000'>what is our general solution? It is going to be c1 times 3,</span>
  <span m='2097000'>negative 5 e to the minus 6t.</span> </p><p><span m='2102000'>And
  then the other normal mode</span> <span m='2106000'>times an arbitrary constant
  will be 1, 1 times e to the 2t.</span> </p><p><span m='2118000'>I am going to use
  the same strategy.</span> </p><p><span m='2120000'>We have our two normal modes
  here, eigenvalue,</span> <span m='2124000'>eigenvector solutions from which, by
  adjusting these</span> <span m='2127000'>constants, we can get our four basic solutions.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2132000'>Those are going to look like, let's draw a picture here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2137000'>Again, I will color-code them. Let's use pink again.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2142000'>The pink solution now starts at 3, negative 5.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2147000'>That is where it is when t is</span> <span m='2150000'>zero. And, because
  of the coefficient</span> <span m='2154000'>minus 6 up there, it is coming into
  the origin</span> <span m='2158000'>and looks like that. And its mirror image,</span>
  <span m='2163000'>of course, does the same thing. That is when c1 is negative</span>
  <span m='2168000'>one. How about the orange guy?</span> </p><p><span m='2170000'>Well,
  when t is equal to zero, it is at 1, 1.</span> </p><p><span m='2174000'>But what
  is it doing after</span> <span m='2176000'>that? As t increases,</span> <span m='2178000'>it
  is getting further away from the origin because the sign here</span> <span m='2182000'>is
  positive. e to the 2t is</span> <span m='2185000'>increasing, it is not decreasing
  anymore, so this guy is going</span> <span m='2190000'>out. And its mirror image
  on the</span> <span m='2195000'>other side is doing the same thing.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2200000'>Now all we have to do is fill in the picture.</span> </p><p><span m='2206000'>Well,
  you fill it in by continuity.</span> </p><p><span m='2211000'>Your nearby trajectories
  must be doing what similar thing?</span> </p><p><span m='2220000'>If I start out
  very near the pink guy, I should stay near the</span> <span m='2224000'>pink guy.
  But as I get near the origin,</span> <span m='2227000'>I am also approaching the
  orange guy.</span> </p><p><span m='2229000'>Well, there is no other possibility
  other than that.</span> </p><p><span m='2233000'>If you are further away you start
  turning a little sooner.</span> </p><p><span m='2237000'>I am just using an argument
  from continuity to say the</span> <span m='2241000'>picture must be roughly filled
  out this way.</span> </p><p><span m='2244000'>Maybe not exactly. In fact, there
  are fine points.</span> </p><p><span m='2249000'>And I am going to ask you to do
  one of them on Friday for the</span> <span m='2252000'>new problem set, even before
  the exam,</span> <span m='2255000'>God forbid. But I want you to get a little</span>
  <span m='2257000'>more experience working with that linear phase portrait</span>
  <span m='2261000'>visual because it is, I think, one of the best ones</span> <span
  m='2264000'>this semester. You can learn a lot from it.</span> </p><p><span m='2267000'>Anyway,
  you are not done with it, but I hope you have at least</span> <span m='2271000'>looked
  at it by now. That is what the picture looks</span> <span m='2274000'>like. First
  of all,</span> <span m='2275000'>what are we going to name this? In other words,</span>
  <span m='2280000'>forget about the arrows. If you just look at the general</span>
  <span m='2285000'>way those lines go, where have you seen this</span> <span m='2288000'>before?
  You saw this in 18.02.</span> </p><p><span m='2291000'>What was the topic? You were
  plotting contour</span> <span m='2295000'>curves of functions, were you not?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2298000'>What did you call contours curves that formed that pattern?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2303000'>A saddle point. You called this a saddle point</span> <span
  m='2306000'>because it was like the center of a saddle.</span> </p><p><span m='2312000'>It
  is like a mountain pass. Here you are going up the</span> <span m='2315000'>mountain,
  say, and here you are going down,</span> <span m='2317000'>the way the contour line
  is going down.</span> </p><p><span m='2320000'>And this is sort of a min and max
  point.</span> </p><p><span m='2322000'>A maximum if you go in that direction and
  a minimum if you</span> <span m='2326000'>go in that direction, say.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2328000'>Without the arrows on it, it is like a saddle point.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2331000'>And so the same word is used here.</span> </p><p><span m='2333000'>It
  is called the saddle. You don't say point in the same</span> <span m='2336000'>way
  you don't say a nodal point. It is the whole picture,</span> <span m='2341000'>as
  it were, that is the saddle. It is a saddle.</span> </p><p><span m='2345000'>There
  is the saddle. This is where you sit.</span> </p><p><span m='2348000'>Now, should
  I call it a source or a sink?</span> </p><p><span m='2352000'>I cannot call it either
  because it is a sink along these lines,</span> <span m='2356000'>it is a source
  along those lines and along the others,</span> <span m='2361000'>it starts out looking
  like a sink and then turns around and</span> <span m='2365000'>starts acting like
  a source. The word source and sink are</span> <span m='2371000'>not used for saddle.
  The only word that is used is</span> <span m='2374000'>unstable because definitely
  it is unstable.</span> </p><p><span m='2378000'>If you start off exactly on the
  pink lines you do end up at the</span> <span m='2382000'>origin, but if you start
  anywhere else ever so close to a</span> <span m='2387000'>pink line you think you
  are going to the origin,</span> <span m='2390000'>but then at the last minute you
  are zooming off out to infinity</span> <span m='2395000'>again. This is a typical
  example of</span> <span m='2397000'>instability. Only if you do the</span> <span
  m='2401000'>mathematically possible, but physically impossible thing</span> <span
  m='2406000'>of starting out exactly on the pink line, only then will you</span>
  <span m='2411000'>get to the origin. If you start out anywhere else,</span> <span
  m='2415000'>make the slightest error in measure and get off the pink</span> <span
  m='2420000'>line, you end off at infinity. What is the effect with our</span> <span
  m='2425000'>war-like governors fighting for the tourist trade willing to</span>
  <span m='2430000'>spend any amounts of money to match and overmatch what their</span>
  <span m='2435000'>competitor in the nearby state is spending?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2441000'>The answer is, they all lose.</span> </p><p><span m='2443000'>Since
  it is mostly this section of the diagram that makes sense,</span> <span m='2448000'>what
  happens is they end up all spending an infinity of dollars</span> <span m='2453000'>and
  nobody gets any more tourists than anybody else.</span> </p><p><span m='2458000'>So
  this is a model of what not to do.</span> </p><p><span m='2462000'>I have one more
  model to show you.</span> </p><p><span m='2465000'>Maybe we better start over at
  this board here.</span> </p><p><span m='2471000'>Massachusetts on top. New Hampshire
  on the bottom.</span> </p><p><span m='2477000'>x prime is going to be, that is Massachusetts,</span>
  <span m='2483000'>I guess as before. Let me get the numbers right.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2505000'>Leave that out for a moment. y prime is 2x minus 3y.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2510000'>New Hampshire behaves normally.</span> </p><p><span m='2514000'>It is
  ready to respond to anything Massachusetts can put</span> <span m='2519000'>out.
  But by itself,</span> <span m='2521000'>it really wants to bring its budget to normal.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2525000'>Now, Massachusetts, we have a Mormon governor now,</span>
  <span m='2529000'>I guess. Imagine instead we have a</span> <span m='2532000'>Buddhist
  governor. A Buddhist governor reacts as</span> <span m='2536000'>follows, minus
  y. What does that mean?</span> </p><p><span m='2540000'>It means that when he sees
  New Hampshire increasing the budget,</span> <span m='2545000'>his reaction is, we
  will lower ours.</span> </p><p><span m='2550000'>We will show them love. It looks
  suicidal,</span> <span m='2554000'>but what actually happens? Well, our little program
  is</span> <span m='2559000'>over. Our matrix a is negative 1,</span> <span m='2562000'>negative
  1, 2, negative 3.</span> </p><p><span m='2566000'>The characteristic equations is</span>
  <span m='2570000'>lambda squared plus 4 lambda.</span> </p><p><span m='2575000'>And
  now what is the other term? 3 minus negative 2 makes 5.</span> </p><p><span m='2582000'>This
  is not going to factor because I tried it out and I</span> <span m='2587000'>know
  it is not going to factor. We are going to get lambda</span> <span m='2593000'>equals,
  we will just use the quadratic formula,</span> <span m='2597000'>negative 4 plus
  or minus the square root of 16 minus 4 times</span> <span m='2603000'>5, that is
  16 minus 20 or negative 4 all divided by 2,</span> <span m='2608000'>which makes
  minus 2, pull out the 4,</span> <span m='2611000'>that makes it a 2, cancels this
  2,</span> <span m='2615000'>minus 1 inside. It is minus 2 plus or minus i.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2620000'>Complex solutions.</span> </p><p><span m='2624000'>What
  are we doing to do about that?</span> </p><p><span m='2627000'>Well, you should
  rejoice when you get this case and are asked</span> <span m='2633000'>to sketch
  it because, even if you calculate the</span> <span m='2638000'>complex eigenvector
  and from that take its real and imaginary</span> <span m='2644000'>parts of the
  complex solution, in fact, you will not be able</span> <span m='2650000'>easily
  to sketch the answer anyway.</span> </p><p><span m='2655000'>But let me show you
  what sort of thing you can get and then I</span> <span m='2658000'>am going to wave
  my hands and argue a little bit to try to</span> <span m='2661000'>indicate what
  it is that the solution actually looks like.</span> </p><p><span m='2664000'>You
  are going to get something that looks like --</span> <span m='2668000'>A typical
  real solution is going to look like this.</span> </p><p><span m='2671000'>This is
  going to produce e to the minus 2t times e</span> <span m='2676000'>to the i t.
  e to the minus 2 plus i all</span> <span m='2680000'>times t. This will be our exponential</span>
  <span m='2684000'>factor which is shrinking in amplitude.</span> </p><p><span m='2687000'>This
  is going to give me sines and cosines.</span> </p><p><span m='2690000'>When I separate
  out the eigenvector into its real and</span> <span m='2694000'>imaginary parts,
  it is going to look something</span> <span m='2697000'>like this. a1, a2 times cosine
  t,</span> <span m='2702000'>that is from the e to the it</span> <span m='2705000'>part.
  Then there will be a sine term.</span> </p><p><span m='2708000'>And all that is
  going to be multiplied by the exponential</span> <span m='2712000'>factor e to the
  negative 2t.</span> </p><p><span m='2722000'>That is just one normal mode. It is
  going to be c1 times this</span> <span m='2728000'>plus c2 times something similar.
  It doesn't matter exactly what</span> <span m='2734000'>it is because they are all
  going to look the same.</span> </p><p><span m='2737000'>Namely, this is a shrinking
  amplitude.</span> </p><p><span m='2740000'>I am not going to worry about that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2742000'>My real question is, what does this look like?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2745000'>In other words, as a pair of parametric</span> <span m='2748000'>equations,
  if x is equal to a1 cosine t plus b1 sine t</span> <span m='2752000'>and y is a2
  cosine plus b2 sine,</span> <span m='2756000'>what does it look like?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2761000'>Well, what are its characteristics?</span> </p><p><span m='2763000'>In
  the first place, as a curve this part of it is</span> <span m='2768000'>bounded.
  It stays within some large box</span> <span m='2771000'>because cosine and sine
  never get bigger than one and never</span> <span m='2776000'>get smaller than minus
  one. It is periodic.</span> </p><p><span m='2780000'>As t increases to t plus 2pi,</span>
  <span m='2784000'>it comes back to exactly the same point it was at before.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2795000'>We have a curve that is repeating itself periodically,</span>
  <span m='2798000'>it does not go off to infinity. And here is where I am waving</span>
  <span m='2802000'>my hands. It satisfies an equation.</span> </p><p><span m='2804000'>Those
  of you who like to fool around with mathematics a little</span> <span m='2809000'>bit,
  it is not difficult to show this, but it satisfies an</span> <span m='2812000'>equation
  of the form A x squared plus B y squared plus C xy</span> <span m='2816000'>equals
  D.</span> </p><p><span m='2820000'>All you have to do is figure out what the coefficients
  A,</span> <span m='2823000'>B, C and D should be. And the way to do it is,</span>
  <span m='2826000'>if you calculate the square of x you are going to get cosine</span>
  <span m='2830000'>squared, sine squared and a cosine sine term.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2833000'>You are going to get those same three terms here and the same</span>
  <span m='2837000'>three terms here. You just use undetermined</span> <span m='2840000'>coefficients,
  set up a system of simultaneous</span> <span m='2843000'>equations and you will
  be able to find the A,</span> <span m='2846000'>B, C and D that work. I am looking
  for a curve that</span> <span m='2851000'>is bounded, keeps repeating its values
  and that satisfies a</span> <span m='2855000'>quadratic equation which looks like
  this.</span> </p><p><span m='2858000'>Well, an earlier generation would know from
  high school,</span> <span m='2862000'>these curves are all conic sections.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2865000'>The only curves that satisfy equations like that are</span>
  <span m='2868000'>hyperbola, parabolas, the conic sections in other</span> <span
  m='2872000'>words, and ellipses. Circles are a special kind of</span> <span m='2876000'>ellipses.
  There is a degenerate case.</span> </p><p><span m='2880000'>A pair of lines which
  can be considered a degenerate</span> <span m='2884000'>hyperbola, if you want.
  It is as much a hyperbola as a</span> <span m='2888000'>circle, as an ellipse say.
  Which of these is it?</span> </p><p><span m='2891000'>Well, it must be those guys.
  Those are the only guys that</span> <span m='2896000'>stay bounded and repeat themselves
  periodically.</span> </p><p><span m='2900000'>The other guys don't do that. These
  are ellipses.</span> </p><p><span m='2903000'>And, therefore, what do they look
  like?</span> </p><p><span m='2908000'>Well, they must look like an ellipse that
  is trying to be an</span> <span m='2912000'>ellipse, but each time it goes around
  the point is pulled a</span> <span m='2917000'>little closer to the origin. It must
  be doing this,</span> <span m='2921000'>in other words. And such a point is called
  a</span> <span m='2924000'>spiral sink. Again sink because,</span> <span m='2927000'>no
  matter where you start, you will get a curve that</span> <span m='2931000'>spirals
  into the origin. Spiral is self-explanatory.</span> </p><p><span m='2935000'>And
  the one thing I haven't told you that you must read is</span> <span m='2940000'>how
  do you know that it goes around counterclockwise and not</span> <span m='2944000'>clockwise?
  Read clockwise or</span> <span m='2948000'>counterclockwise. I will give you the
  answer in</span> <span m='2952000'>30 seconds, not for this particular curve.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2956000'>That you will have to calculate.</span> </p><p><span m='2959000'>All
  you have to do is put in somewhere.</span> </p><p><span m='2963000'>Let's say at
  the point (1, 0), a single vector from the</span> <span m='2968000'>velocity field.
  In other words,</span> <span m='2972000'>at the point (1, 0), when x is 1 and y
  is 0 our</span> <span m='2977000'>vector is minus 1, 2,</span> <span m='2980000'>which
  is the vector minus 1, 2, it goes like this.</span> </p><p><span m='2986000'>Therefore,
  the motion must be counterclockwise.</span> </p><p><span m='2991000'>And, by the
  way, what is the effect of having a</span> <span m='2996000'>Buddhist governor?
  Peace.</span> </p><p><span m='3000000'>Everything spirals into the origin and everybody
  is left</span> <span m='3005000'>with the same advertising budget they always had.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3010000'>Thanks.</span> </p>
