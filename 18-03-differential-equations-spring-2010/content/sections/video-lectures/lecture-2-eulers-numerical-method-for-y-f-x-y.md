transcript: '<p><span m=''20000''>The topic for today is --</span> <span m=''32000''>Today
  we''re going to talk, I''m postponing the linear</span> <span m=''35000''>equations
  to next time. Instead, I think it''s a good</span> <span m=''38000''>idea, since
  in real life, most of the differential</span> <span m=''42000''>equations are solved
  by numerical methods to introduce</span> <span m=''45000''>you to those right away.
  Even when you see the compute</span> <span m=''49000''>where you saw the computer
  screen, the solutions being</span> <span m=''53000''>drawn. Of course, what really
  was</span> <span m=''55000''>happening was that the computer was calculating the
  solutions</span> <span m=''59000''>numerically, and plotting the points.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''63000''>So, this is the main way, numerically,</span> <span m=''65000''>it
  is the main way differential equations are actually solved,</span> <span m=''69000''>if
  they are of any complexity at all.</span> </p><p><span m=''72000''>So, the problem
  is, that initial value problem,</span> <span m=''75000''>let''s write up the first-order
  problem the way we talked about</span> <span m=''80000''>it on Wednesday. And now,
  I''ll specifically add</span> <span m=''83000''>to that, the starting point that
  you used when you did the</span> <span m=''87000''>computer experiments. And, I''ll
  write the starting</span> <span m=''92000''>point this way. So, y of x0 should be
  y0.</span> </p><p><span m=''95000''>So, this is the initial</span> <span m=''98000''>condition,
  and this is the first-order differential</span> <span m=''102000''>equation. And,
  as you know,</span> <span m=''104000''>the two of them together are called an IVP,</span>
  <span m=''108000''>an initial value problem, which means two things,</span> <span
  m=''111000''>the differential equation and the initial value that you want</span>
  <span m=''116000''>to start the solution at. Okay, now, the method we are</span>
  <span m=''123000''>going to talk about, the basic method of which many</span> <span
  m=''128000''>others are merely refinements in one way or another,</span> <span m=''134000''>is
  called Euler''s method. Euler, who did,</span> <span m=''139000''>of course, everything
  in analysis, as far as I know,</span> <span m=''145000''>didn''t actually use it
  to compute solutions of</span> <span m=''150000''>differential equations. His interest
  was theoretical.</span> </p><p><span m=''156000''>He used it as a method of proving
  the existence theorem,</span> <span m=''160000''>proving that solutions existed.
  But, nowadays,</span> <span m=''164000''>it''s used to calculate the solutions numerically.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''167000''>And, the method is very simple to describe.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''171000''>It''s so naive that you probably think that if you that living</span>
  <span m=''175000''>300 years ago, you would have discovered it</span> <span m=''179000''>and
  covered yourself with glory for all eternity.</span> </p><p><span m=''184000''>So,
  here is our starting point, (x0, y0).</span> </p><p><span m=''187000''>Now, what
  information do we have?</span> </p><p><span m=''190000''>At that point all we have
  is the little line element,</span> <span m=''194000''>whose slope is given by f
  of (x, y).</span> </p><p><span m=''198000''>So, if I start the solution,</span>
  <span m=''201000''>the only way the solution could possibly go would be to start</span>
  <span m=''206000''>off in that direction, since I have no other</span> <span m=''210000''>information.
  At least it has the correct</span> <span m=''215000''>direction at (x0, y0).</span>
  </p><p><span m=''216000''>But, of course, it''s not likely to have the</span> <span
  m=''220000''>correct direction anywhere else. Now, what you do,</span> <span m=''223000''>then,
  is choose a step size. I''ll try just two steps of the</span> <span m=''228000''>method.
  That''s, I think,</span> <span m=''230000''>good enough. Choose a uniform step size,</span>
  <span m=''233000''>which is usually called h. And, you continue that solution</span>
  <span m=''237000''>until you get to the next point, which will be x0 + h,</span>
  <span m=''242000''>as I''ve drawn it on the picture.</span> </p><p><span m=''246000''>So,
  we get to here. We stop at that point,</span> <span m=''249000''>and now you recalculate
  what the line element is here.</span> </p><p><span m=''252000''>Suppose, here, the
  line element,</span> <span m=''255000''>now, through this point goes like that.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''258000''>Well, then, that''s the new direction that you should
  start</span> <span m=''262000''>out with going from here. And so, the next step
  of the</span> <span m=''266000''>process will carry you to here. That''s two steps
  of Euler''s</span> <span m=''270000''>method. Notice it produces a broken</span>
  <span m=''273000''>line approximation to the solution.</span> </p><p><span m=''276000''>But,
  in fact, you only see that broken line</span> <span m=''279000''>if you are at a
  computer if you are looking at the computer</span> <span m=''283000''>visual, for
  example, whose purpose is to illustrate</span> <span m=''287000''>for you Euler''s
  method. In actual practice,</span> <span m=''290000''>what you see is, the computer
  is simply</span> <span m=''293000''>calculating this point, that point, and the
  succession</span> <span m=''297000''>of points. And, many programs will just</span>
  <span m=''299000''>automatically connect those points by a smooth looking curve</span>
  <span m=''304000''>if that''s what you prefer to see.</span> </p><p><span m=''308000''>Well,
  that''s all there is to the method.</span> </p><p><span m=''311000''>What we have
  to do now is derive the equations for the</span> <span m=''315000''>method. Now,
  how are we going to do</span> <span m=''318000''>that? Well, the essence of it is
  how</span> <span m=''321000''>to get from the nth step to the n plus first</span>
  <span m=''326000''>step? So, I''m going to draw a picture</span> <span m=''329000''>just
  to illustrate that. So, now we are not at x0.</span> </p><p><span m=''334000''>But
  let''s say we''ve already gotten to (xn,</span> <span m=''337000''>yn). How do I
  take the next step?</span> </p><p><span m=''340000''>Well, I take the line element,
  and it goes up like that,</span> <span m=''344000''>let''s say, because the slope
  is this.</span> </p><p><span m=''347000''>I''m going to call that slope A sub n.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''351000''>Of course, A sub n is the value of the right hand side
  at the</span> <span m=''356000''>point (xn, yn), and we will need that in the</span>
  <span m=''359000''>equation, -- -- but I think it will be a</span> <span m=''363000''>little
  bit clearer if I just give it a capital letter at this</span> <span m=''368000''>point.
  Now, this is the new point,</span> <span m=''370000''>and all I want to know is
  what are its coordinates?</span> </p><p><span m=''374000''>Well, the x n plus one
  is there.</span> </p><p><span m=''377000''>The y n plus one is here.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''379000''>Clearly I should draw this triangle, complete the triangle.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''383000''>This side of the triangle, the hypotenuse has slope An.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''387000''>This side of the triangle has length h.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''390000''>h is the step size. Perhaps I''d better indicate</span> <span m=''393000''>that,
  actually put that up so that you know the word step.</span> </p><p><span m=''399000''>It''s
  the step size on the x-axis, how far you have to go</span> <span m=''404000''>to
  get from each x to the next one.</span> </p><p><span m=''407000''>What''s this?
  Well, if that slope has this,</span> <span m=''411000''>the slope An, this is h.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''413000''>Then this must be h times An, the length of that side,</span>
  <span m=''418000''>in order that the ratio of the height to this width should be</span>
  <span m=''423000''>An. And, that gives us the method.</span> </p><p><span m=''427000''>How
  do I get from, clearly, to get from xn to x n</span> <span m=''432000''>plus one,
  I simply add h.</span> </p><p><span m=''436000''>So, that''s the trivial part of
  it.</span> </p><p><span m=''439000''>The interesting thing is, how do I get the
  new</span> <span m=''444000''>y n plus one? And so, the best way to write</span>
  <span m=''448000''>it as, that y n plus one minus yn divided by h,</span> <span
  m=''452000''>well, sorry, y n plus one minus yn is this</span> <span m=''456000''>line,
  the same as the line h times An.</span> </p><p><span m=''463000''>So, that''s the
  way to write it. Or, since the computer is</span> <span m=''467000''>interested
  in calculating y n plus one itself,</span> <span m=''472000''>put this on the other
  side. You take the old yn,</span> <span m=''476000''>the previous one, and to it,
  you add h times An.</span> </p><p><span m=''480000''>And, what, pray tell,</span>
  <span m=''483000''>is An? Well, the computer has to be</span> <span m=''487000''>told
  that An is the value of f. So, now, with that,</span> <span m=''491000''>let''s
  actually write the Euler program, not the program,</span> <span m=''495000''>but
  the Euler-- the Euler method equations,</span> <span m=''499000''>let''s just call
  it the Euler equations.</span> </p><p><span m=''502000''>What will they be? First
  of all,</span> <span m=''504000''>the new x is the old x plus h.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''508000''>The new y is just what I''ve written there,</span> <span m=''511000''>the
  old y plus h times a certain number,</span> <span m=''514000''>An, and finally,</span>
  <span m=''518000''>An has the value-- It''s the slope of the line</span> <span m=''523000''>element
  here, and therefore by definition,</span> <span m=''527000''>that''s f of (xn,yn).</span>
  </p><p><span m=''530000''>So, if these three equations which define Euler''s method.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''535000''>I assume in 1.00 you must be asked to, at some point,</span>
  <span m=''540000''>as an exercise in the term at one point to program the</span>
  <span m=''545000''>computer in C or whatever they''re using,</span> <span m=''548000''>Java,
  now, I guess, to do Euler''s method.</span> </p><p><span m=''554000''>And, these
  would be the recursive equations that you</span> <span m=''560000''>would put in
  to do that. Okay, let''s try an example,</span> <span m=''567000''>then. So, what
  would be a good color</span> <span m=''572000''>for Euler? Well, a purple.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''575000''>I assume nobody can see purple. Is that correct?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''580000''>Can anyone in the back of the room see that that''s purple?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''586000''>Okay. Sit closer.</span> </p><p><span m=''588000''>So,
  let''s calculate. The example,</span> <span m=''592000''>I''ll use a simple example,
  but it''s not entirely trivial.</span> </p><p><span m=''600000''>My example is going
  to be the equation, x squared minus y</span> <span m=''603000''>squared on the right
  hand side.</span> </p><p><span m=''607000''>And, let''s start with y of zero equals
  one,</span> <span m=''610000''>let''s say. And so, this is my initial</span> <span
  m=''613000''>value problem, that pair of equations.</span> </p><p><span m=''616000''>And,
  I have to specify a step size.</span> </p><p><span m=''618000''>So, let''s take
  the step size to 0.1.</span> </p><p><span m=''620000''>You choose the step size,
  or the computer does.</span> </p><p><span m=''624000''>We''ll have to talk about
  that in a few minutes.</span> </p><p><span m=''627000''>Now, what do you do? Well,
  I say this is a</span> <span m=''631000''>nontrivial equation because this equation,
  as far as I know,</span> <span m=''636000''>cannot be solved in terms of elementary
  functions.</span> </p><p><span m=''639000''>So, this equation would be, in fact,
  a very good candidate</span> <span m=''643000''>for a numerical method like Euler''s.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''646000''>And, you had to use it, or maybe it was the other way</span>
  <span m=''650000''>around, I forget. On your problem set,</span> <span m=''653000''>you
  drew a picture of the direction field and answered</span> <span m=''657000''>some
  questions about the isoclines, how the solutions</span> <span m=''661000''>behave.
  Now, the main thing I want you</span> <span m=''664000''>to get, this is not just
  for Euler''s, talking about Euler''s</span> <span m=''668000''>equations. But in
  general,</span> <span m=''670000''>for the calculations you have to do in this course,</span>
  <span m=''673000''>it''s extremely important to be systematic because if you are</span>
  <span m=''677000''>not systematic, you know, if you just scribble,</span> <span
  m=''680000''>scribble, scribble, scribble, scribble,</span> <span m=''682000''>you
  can do the work, but it becomes impossible to</span> <span m=''685000''>find mistakes.
  You must do the work in a form</span> <span m=''688000''>in which it can be checked,
  which you can look over it and</span> <span m=''692000''>find, and try to see where
  mistakes are if,</span> <span m=''695000''>in fact, there are any. So, I strongly
  suggest,</span> <span m=''699000''>this is not a suggestion, this is a command,</span>
  <span m=''703000''>that you make a little table to do Euler''s method by hand,</span>
  <span m=''708000''>I''d only ask you for a step or two, but since I''m just trying</span>
  <span m=''713000''>to make sure you have some idea of these equations and where</span>
  <span m=''718000''>they come from. So, first, the value of n,</span> <span m=''722000''>then
  the value of xn, then the value of the yn,</span> <span m=''726000''>and then, a
  couple of more columns which tell you how to do</span> <span m=''731000''>the calculation.
  You are going to need the value</span> <span m=''735000''>of the slope, and it''s
  probably a good idea,</span> <span m=''738000''>also, because otherwise you''ll
  forget it, to put in h An</span> <span m=''743000''>because that occurs in the formula.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''746000''>All right, let''s start doing it.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''750000''>The first value of n is zero. That''s the starting point.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''754000''>At the starting point, (x0, y0), x has the value zero,</span> <span
  m=''758000''>and y has the value one, so, zero and one.</span> </p><p><span m=''762000''>In
  other words, starting, I''m carrying out</span> <span m=''765000''>exactly what
  I drew pictorially only now I''m doing it</span> <span m=''769000''>arithmetically
  using a table and substituting into the formulas.</span> </p><p><span m=''775000''>Okay,
  the next thing we have to calculate is An.</span> </p><p><span m=''780000''>Well,
  since An is the value of the right hand side,</span> <span m=''783000''>at the point
  zero one, you have to plug that in.</span> </p><p><span m=''787000''>The right-hand
  side is x squared minus y squared.</span> </p><p><span m=''791000''>So, it''s 0
  squared minus 1 squared.</span> </p><p><span m=''794000''>The value of the slope,</span>
  <span m=''797000''>there, is minus one, negative one.</span> </p><p><span m=''800000''>Now,
  I have to multiply that by H.</span> </p><p><span m=''802000''>h is 0.1. So, it''s
  negative,</span> <span m=''804000''>I''ll never learn that. The way you learn to
  talk in</span> <span m=''808000''>kindergarten is the way you learn to talk the
  rest of your</span> <span m=''812000''>life, unfortunately. In kindergarten,</span>
  <span m=''817000''>we said minus. Negative 0.1.</span> </p><p><span m=''820000''>n
  is one now. What''s the value of xn?</span> </p><p><span m=''825000''>Well, to the
  old value I add 1/10.</span> </p><p><span m=''828000''>What''s the value of y? Well,
  at this point,</span> <span m=''833000''>you have to do the calculation. It''s the
  old value of y.</span> </p><p><span m=''839000''>To get this new value, it''s the
  old value plus this</span> <span m=''845000''>number. Well, that''s this plus that</span>
  <span m=''851000''>number is nine-tenths. An, now I have to calculate the</span>
  <span m=''856000''>new slope at this point. Okay, that is one-tenth squared</span>
  <span m=''863000''>minus nine-tenths squared. That''s 0.01 minus 0.81,</span> <span
  m=''868000''>which makes minus 0.80, I hope.</span> </p><p><span m=''878000''>Check
  it on your calculators. Whip them out and press the</span> <span m=''883000''>buttons.
  I now multiply that by h,</span> <span m=''886000''>which means it''s going to be
  minus 0.08, perhaps with a zero</span> <span m=''891000''>after. I didn''t tell
  you how many</span> <span m=''894000''>decimal places. Let''s carry it out to two</span>
  <span m=''898000''>decimal places. I think that will be good</span> <span m=''902000''>enough.
  And finally,</span> <span m=''905000''>the last step, 2, here, add another one-tenth,</span>
  <span m=''910000''>so the value of x is now two-tenths.</span> </p><p><span m=''915000''>And
  finally, what''s the value of y?</span> </p><p><span m=''918000''>Well, I didn''t
  tell you where to stop.</span> </p><p><span m=''922000''>Let''s stop at y of 0.2
  because there''s no</span> <span m=''928000''>more room on the blackboard. About
  approximately how big is</span> <span m=''934000''>that? In other words,</span>
  <span m=''936000''>this is, then, this is going to be the old y</span> <span m=''941000''>plus
  this number, which seems to be 0.82 to me.</span> </p><p><span m=''948000''>So,
  the answer is, the new value is 0.82.</span> </p><p><span m=''951000''>Okay, we
  got a number. We did what we are supposed to</span> <span m=''955000''>do. We got
  a number.</span> </p><p><span m=''956000''>Next question? Now, let''s ask a few
  questions.</span> </p><p><span m=''960000''>One of the first, most basic things
  is,</span> <span m=''963000''>you know, how right is this? How can I answer such
  a</span> <span m=''967000''>question if I have no explicit formula for that solution?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''971000''>That''s the basic problem with numerical calculation.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''975000''>In other words, I have to wander around in the</span>
  <span m=''978000''>dark to some extent, and yet have some idea when</span> <span
  m=''981000''>I''ve arrived at the place that I want to go.</span> </p><p><span m=''984000''>Well,
  the first question I''d like to answer,</span> <span m=''988000''>is this too high
  or too low? Is Euler, sorry,</span> <span m=''992000''>he''ll forgive me in heaven,
  I will use him.</span> </p><p><span m=''996000''>By this, I mean, is the result,</span>
  <span m=''998000''>let me just say something first, and that I''ll criticize</span>
  <span m=''1003000''>it. Is Euler too high or too low?</span> </p><p><span m=''1006000''>In
  other words, is the result of using Euler''s</span> <span m=''1010000''>method,
  i.e. is this number too high or too</span> <span m=''1013000''>low? Is it higher
  than the right</span> <span m=''1016000''>answer, what it should be? Or, is it lower
  than the right</span> <span m=''1022000''>answer? Or, God forbid,</span> <span m=''1025000''>is
  it exactly right? Well, it''s almost never exactly</span> <span m=''1029000''>right.
  That''s not an option.</span> </p><p><span m=''1032000''>Now, how will we answer
  that question?</span> </p><p><span m=''1036000''>Well, let''s answer it geometrically.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1039000''>Basically, if the solution were a straight line,</span>
  <span m=''1044000''>then the Euler method would be exactly right all the time.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1049000''>But, it''s not a line. Then it''s a curve.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1054000''>Well, the critical question is, is it curved?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1058000''>Is the solution? So, here''s a solution.</span> </p><p><span m=''1061000''>Let''s
  call it y1 of x, and let''s say here</span> <span m=''1065000''>was the starting
  point. Here, the solution is convex.</span> </p><p><span m=''1069000''>And, here
  the solution is concave, right?</span> </p><p><span m=''1072000''>Concave up or
  concave down, if you learn those words,</span> <span m=''1077000''>but I think those
  have, by now, I hope pretty well</span> <span m=''1081000''>disappeared from the
  curriculum. Call it, if you haven''t up</span> <span m=''1086000''>until now, what
  mathematicians call it, convex is that,</span> <span m=''1090000''>and the other
  one is concave. Well, how do Euler''s solutions</span> <span m=''1093000''>look?
  Well, I''ll just sketch.</span> </p><p><span m=''1095000''>I think from this you
  can see already, when you start out on</span> <span m=''1099000''>the Euler''s solution,
  it''s going to go like that.</span> </p><p><span m=''1102000''>Now you are too low.
  Well, let''s suppose after that,</span> <span m=''1105000''>the line element here
  is approximately the same as what</span> <span m=''1108000''>it is there, or roughly
  parallel.</span> </p><p><span m=''1112000''>After all, they are not too far apart.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1114000''>And, the direction field is continuous.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1117000''>That is, the directions don''t change drastically from one</span>
  <span m=''1120000''>point to another. But now, you see it''s still too</span> <span
  m=''1123000''>low. It''s even lower as it</span> <span m=''1125000''>pathetically
  tries to follow. It''s losing territory,</span> <span m=''1129000''>and that''s
  basically because the curve is convex.</span> </p><p><span m=''1132000''>Exactly
  the opposite what would happen if the curve were</span> <span m=''1135000''>concave,
  if the solution curve were concave.</span> </p><p><span m=''1140000''>Now it''s
  too high, and it''s not going to be able</span> <span m=''1144000''>to correct that
  as long as the solution curve stays concave.</span> </p><p><span m=''1149000''>Well,
  that''s probably too optimistic.</span> </p><p><span m=''1153000''>It''s probably
  more like this. So, in other words,</span> <span m=''1157000''>in this case, if
  the curve is convex,</span> <span m=''1161000''>Euler is going to be too high, sorry,
  too low.</span> </p><p><span m=''1165000''>Let''s put E for Euler. How about that?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1170000''>Euler is too low. If it''s concave,</span> <span m=''1172000''>then
  Euler is too high. Okay, that''s great.</span> </p><p><span m=''1176000''>There''s
  just one little problem left, namely,</span> <span m=''1180000''>if we don''t have
  a formula for the solution,</span> <span m=''1184000''>and we don''t have a computer
  that''s busy drawing the picture</span> <span m=''1189000''>for us, in which case
  we wouldn''t need any of this</span> <span m=''1194000''>anyway, how are we supposed
  to tell if it''s convex or concave?</span> </p><p><span m=''1201000''>Back to calculus.
  Calculus to the rescue!</span> </p><p><span m=''1204000''>When is a curve convex?
  A curve is convex if its second</span> <span m=''1208000''>derivative is positive
  because the first to be convex means the</span> <span m=''1212000''>first derivative
  is increasing all the time.</span> </p><p><span m=''1216000''>And therefore, the
  second derivative,</span> <span m=''1218000''>which is the derivative of the first
  derivative,</span> <span m=''1222000''>should be positive. Just the opposite here;</span>
  <span m=''1225000''>the curve, the slope is, the first derivative,</span> <span
  m=''1229000''>is decreasing all the time and therefore the second derivative</span>
  <span m=''1233000''>is negative. So, all we have to do is decide</span> <span m=''1238000''>what
  the second derivative of the solution is.</span> </p><p><span m=''1241000''>We should
  probably call it a solution.</span> </p><p><span m=''1243000''>y of x is a little
  too vague.</span> </p><p><span m=''1246000''>y1 means the solution started at this
  point.</span> </p><p><span m=''1249000''>So, in fact, probably it would have been</span>
  <span m=''1252000''>better from the beginning to call that y1,</span> <span m=''1254000''>except
  there''s no room, y1, let''s say.</span> </p><p><span m=''1257000''>That means the
  solution which started out at the point,</span> <span m=''1261000''>(0, 1). So,
  I''m still talking about at</span> <span m=''1264000''>a solution like that. All
  right, so I want to know if</span> <span m=''1268000''>this is positive, the second
  derivative is</span> <span m=''1270000''>positive at the starting point, zero, or
  it''s negative.</span> </p><p><span m=''1274000''>Now, again, how you can regulate
  the second derivative,</span> <span m=''1277000''>if you don''t know what the solution
  is explicitly,</span> <span m=''1280000''>then the answer is you can do it from
  the differential</span> <span m=''1284000''>equation itself. How do I do that?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1286000''>Well: easy. y prime equals x squared minus</span> <span
  m=''1289000''>y squared. Okay, that tells me how to</span> <span m=''1294000''>calculate
  y prime if I know the value of x and y,</span> <span m=''1299000''>in other words,
  the 0.01.</span> </p><p><span m=''1301000''>What would be the value of y double
  prime?</span> </p><p><span m=''1305000''>Well, differentiate the equation.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1308000''>It''s two x minus two y y prime.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1312000''>Don''t forget to use the chain rule.</span> </p><p><span m=''1315000''>So,
  if I want to calculate at (0, 1), in other words,</span> <span m=''1320000''>if
  my starting point is that curve convex or concave,</span> <span m=''1324000''>well,
  let''s calculate. y of zero equals one.</span> </p><p><span m=''1330000''>Okay,
  what''s y prime of zero?</span> </p><p><span m=''1332000''>Well, I don''t have to
  repeat</span> <span m=''1335000''>that calculation. Using this, I''ve already</span>
  <span m=''1338000''>calculated that it was negative one.</span> </p><p><span m=''1340000''>And
  now, the new thing, what''s y double prime of zero?</span> </p><p><span m=''1344000''>Well,
  it is this.</span> </p><p><span m=''1346000''>I''ll write it out. It''s two times
  zero minus two</span> <span m=''1349000''>times negative y, which is one,</span>
  <span m=''1351000''>two times one times y prime, which is negative one.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1356000''>You want to see we are pulling</span> <span m=''1361000''>ourselves
  up by our own boot straps, which is impossible.</span> </p><p><span m=''1365000''>But,
  it is not impossible because we are doing it.</span> </p><p><span m=''1369000''>So,
  what''s the answer? Zero here, two,</span> <span m=''1372000''>I''ve calculated
  without having the foggiest idea of what the</span> <span m=''1377000''>solution
  is or how it looks. I''ve calculated that its second</span> <span m=''1383000''>derivative
  at the starting point is two.</span> </p><p><span m=''1387000''>Therefore, my solution
  is convex at the starting point.</span> </p><p><span m=''1393000''>And therefore,
  this Euler approximation,</span> <span m=''1397000''>if I don''t carry it out too
  far, will be too low.</span> </p><p><span m=''1402000''>So, it''s convex Euler,
  too low.</span> </p><p><span m=''1405000''>Now, you could argue, yeah, well, what
  about this?</span> </p><p><span m=''1412000''>[LAUGHTER] So, you could go like this,</span>
  <span m=''1416000''>and then you can see it catches up.</span> </p><p><span m=''1419000''>Well,
  of course, if the curve changes from</span> <span m=''1424000''>convex to concave,
  then it''s really impossible to</span> <span m=''1429000''>make any prediction at
  all. That''s a difficulty.</span> </p><p><span m=''1434000''>So, all this analysis
  is only if you stay very nearby.</span> </p><p><span m=''1442000''>However, I wanted
  to show you, the main purpose of it in my</span> <span m=''1446000''>mind was to
  show you how do you use, it''s these equations,</span> <span m=''1451000''>how to
  use the differential equation itself to get</span> <span m=''1454000''>information
  about the solutions, without actually being able to</span> <span m=''1459000''>calculate
  the solutions? Now, so that''s the method,</span> <span m=''1463000''>and that''s
  how to find out something about it.</span> </p><p><span m=''1467000''>And now, what
  I''d like to talk about is errors.</span> </p><p><span m=''1472000''>How do I handle,
  right?</span> </p><p><span m=''1474000''>So, in a sense, I''ve started the error</span>
  <span m=''1478000''>analysis. In other words,</span> <span m=''1480000''>the error,
  by definition, the error is this difference, e.</span> </p><p><span m=''1486000''>So,
  in other words,</span> <span m=''1488000''>what I''m asking here, is the error positive?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1492000''>It depends which we measure it. Usually, you take this
  minus</span> <span m=''1499000''>that. So, here, the error would be</span> <span
  m=''1503000''>considered positive, and here it would be considered</span> <span
  m=''1507000''>negative, although I''m sure there''s a book somewhere in the</span>
  <span m=''1513000''>world, which does the opposite. Most hedge by just using the</span>
  <span m=''1518000''>absolute value of the error plus a statement that the method
  is</span> <span m=''1523000''>producing answers which are too low or too high.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1527000''>The question, then, is, naturally,</span> <span m=''1530000''>this
  is not the world''s best method.</span> </p><p><span m=''1535000''>It''s not as
  bad as it seems. It''s not the world''s best</span> <span m=''1538000''>method because
  that convexity and concavity means that you are</span> <span m=''1542000''>automatically
  introducing a systematic error.</span> </p><p><span m=''1545000''>If you can predict
  which way the error is going to be by just</span> <span m=''1549000''>knowing whether
  the curve is convex or concave,</span> <span m=''1551000''>it''s not what you want.
  I mean, you want to at least</span> <span m=''1555000''>have a chance of getting
  the right answer,</span> <span m=''1557000''>whereas this is telling you you''re
  definitely going to get</span> <span m=''1561000''>the wrong answer. All it tells
  you is,</span> <span m=''1563000''>and it''s telling you whether your answer is
  going to be too</span> <span m=''1567000''>high or too low. We''ve like a better
  chance of</span> <span m=''1572000''>getting the right answer. Now, so the question
  is,</span> <span m=''1577000''>how do you get a better method? A search is for a
  better</span> <span m=''1583000''>method. Now, the first method,</span> <span m=''1586000''>which
  will occur, I''m sure, to anyone who looks</span> <span m=''1590000''>at that picture,
  is, look, if you want this</span> <span m=''1595000''>yellow line to follow the
  white one, the white solution,</span> <span m=''1600000''>more accurately, for heaven''s
  sake,</span> <span m=''1603000''>don''t take such big steps. Take small steps,</span>
  <span m=''1610000''>and then it will follow better. All right, let''s draw a</span>
  <span m=''1619000''>picture. Excuse me.</span> </p><p><span m=''1622000''>My little
  box of treasures, here.</span> </p><p><span m=''1628000''>[LAUGHTER] So, use a smaller
  step size.</span> </p><p><span m=''1633000''>And the picture, roughly, which is
  going to</span> <span m=''1637000''>justify that, will look like this.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1641000''>If the solution curve looks like this, then with a big step</span>
  <span m=''1646000''>size, I''m liable to have something that looks like that.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1653000''>But, if I take a smaller step size, suppose I halve the
  step</span> <span m=''1658000''>size. How''s it going to look,</span> <span m=''1660000''>then?
  Well, I better switch to a</span> <span m=''1663000''>different color. If I halve
  the step size,</span> <span m=''1667000''>I''ll get a littler, goes like that.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1670000''>And now it''s following closer. Of course, I''m stacking
  the</span> <span m=''1675000''>deck, but see how close it follows?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1680000''>I''m definitely not to be trusted on this.</span> </p><p><span m=''1682000''>Okay,
  let''s do the opposite, make really big steps.</span> </p><p><span m=''1685000''>Suppose
  instead of the yellow ones I used the green one of</span> <span m=''1688000''>double
  step size. Well, what would have happened</span> <span m=''1691000''>then? Well,
  I''ve started out,</span> <span m=''1693000''>but now I''ve gone all the way to
  there.</span> </p><p><span m=''1695000''>And now, on my way up, of course, it has
  a little</span> <span m=''1698000''>further to go. But, if for some reason,</span>
  <span m=''1701000''>I stop there, you could see,</span> <span m=''1702000''>I would
  be still lower. In other words,</span> <span m=''1704000''>the bigger the steps
  size, the more the error.</span> </p><p><span m=''1709000''>And, where are the errors
  that we are talking about?</span> </p><p><span m=''1713000''>Well, the way to think
  of the errors, this is the error,</span> <span m=''1718000''>that number the error.
  You can make it positive,</span> <span m=''1722000''>negative, or just put it automatically
  an absolute value</span> <span m=''1727000''>sign around it. That''s not so important.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1731000''>So, in other words, the conclusion is,</span> <span m=''1734000''>that
  the error e, the difference between the true</span> <span m=''1739000''>value that
  I should have gotten, and the Euler value that the</span> <span m=''1744000''>calculation
  produced, that the error e,</span> <span m=''1748000''>depends on the step size.
  Now, how does it depend on the</span> <span m=''1754000''>step size? Well, it''s
  impossible to give</span> <span m=''1757000''>an exact formula, but there''s an
  approximate</span> <span m=''1760000''>answer, which is, by and large,</span> <span
  m=''1762000''>true. So, the answer is,</span> <span m=''1764000''>e is going to
  be a function of h.</span> </p><p><span m=''1767000''>What function? Well, asymptotically,</span>
  <span m=''1770000''>which is another way of putting quotation marks around,</span>
  <span m=''1774000''>what did I say? It''s going to be a constant,</span> <span m=''1777000''>some
  constant, times H.</span> </p><p><span m=''1780000''>[LAUGHTER] It looks like this,</span>
  <span m=''1812000''>and for this reason it''s called a first order,</span> <span
  m=''1817000''>the Euler is a first-order method.</span> </p><p><span m=''1821000''>And
  now, first-order does not refer to the first order of the</span> <span m=''1828000''>differential
  equation. It''s not the first order</span> <span m=''1834000''>because it''s y prime
  equals f of (x, y).</span> </p><p><span m=''1838000''>The first order means the
  fact</span> <span m=''1841000''>that h occurs to the first power.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1844000''>The way people usually say this is since the normal way of</span>
  <span m=''1849000''>decreasing the step size, as you''ll see as is you try to</span>
  <span m=''1853000''>use a computer visual that deals with the Euler method,</span>
  <span m=''1858000''>which I highly recommend, by the way, so highly</span> <span
  m=''1862000''>recommended that you have to do it, is that the way to say it,</span>
  <span m=''1867000''>each new step halves the step size.</span> </p><p><span m=''1872000''>That''s
  the usual way to do it. If you halve the step size,</span> <span m=''1880000''>since
  this is a constant, if I halve the step size,</span> <span m=''1887000''>I halve
  the error, approximately.</span> </p><p><span m=''1893000''>Halve the step size,
  halve the error.</span> </p><p><span m=''1896000''>That tells you how the error
  varies with step size for</span> <span m=''1902000''>Euler''s method. Please understand,</span>
  <span m=''1906000''>that''s what people say, and please understand the</span> <span
  m=''1911000''>grammatical construction. Since everyone in the math</span> <span
  m=''1916000''>department has a cold these days except me for the moment,</span>
  <span m=''1923000''>everyone goes around chanting this mantra.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1929000''>This is totally irrelevant. This whole mantra,</span> <span m=''1933000''>feed
  a cold, starve a fever.</span> </p><p><span m=''1935000''>And if you asked them
  what it means, they say eat a lot if you</span> <span m=''1941000''>have a cold.
  And if you have a fever,</span> <span m=''1944000''>don''t eat very much, which
  is not what it means at</span> <span m=''1948000''>all. Grammatically,</span> <span
  m=''1950000''>it''s exactly the same construction as this.</span> </p><p><span m=''1953000''>What
  this means is if you halve the step size,</span> <span m=''1957000''>you will halve
  the error. That''s what feed a cold,</span> <span m=''1960000''>starve a fever means.
  And, remember this for the rest</span> <span m=''1964000''>of your life. If you
  feed a cold,</span> <span m=''1966000''>if you eat too much when you have a cold,
  you will get a</span> <span m=''1970000''>fever and end up still having to starve
  yourself because,</span> <span m=''1974000''>of course, nobody, when you have a
  fever,</span> <span m=''1977000''>nobody feels like eating, so they don''t eat anything.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1982000''>All right, you got that? Good.</span> </p><p><span m=''1986000''>I
  want all of you to go home and tell that to your mothers.</span> </p><p><span m=''1994000''>You
  know, that''s the way we always used to speak.</span> </p><p><span m=''2001000''>Grimmer
  ones: spare the rod,</span> <span m=''2005000''>spoil the child does not mean that
  you should not hit your</span> <span m=''2013000''>kid. It means that if you fail
  to</span> <span m=''2019000''>hit your kid, he or she will be spoiled,</span> <span
  m=''2024000''>whatever that means. So, you don''t want to do that.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2030000''>I guess the mantra today would be, I don''t know.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2036000''>Okay, so the first line of defense is simply to keep having</span>
  <span m=''2043000''>the step size in Euler. And, what people do is,</span> <span
  m=''2048000''>if they don''t want to use anything better than Euler''s</span> <span
  m=''2051000''>method, is you keep having the step size until the curve</span> <span
  m=''2055000''>doesn''t seem to change anymore. And then you say,</span> <span m=''2058000''>well,
  that must be the solution.</span> </p><p><span m=''2060000''>And, I asked you on
  the problems set,</span> <span m=''2062000''>how much would you continue to have
  to halve the step size in</span> <span m=''2066000''>order for that good thing to
  happen?</span> </p><p><span m=''2070000''>However, there are more efficient methods
  which get the</span> <span m=''2075000''>results faster. So if that''s our good
  method,</span> <span m=''2079000''>let''s call this our still better method.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2083000''>The better methods aim at being better.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2087000''>They keep the same idea as Euler''s method,</span> <span m=''2091000''>but
  they say, look, let''s try to improve that</span> <span m=''2095000''>slope, An.
  In other words,</span> <span m=''2099000''>since the slope, An, that we start with
  is</span> <span m=''2101000''>guaranteed to be wrong if the curve is convex or concave,</span>
  <span m=''2105000''>can we somehow correct it? So, for example,</span> <span m=''2108000''>instead
  of immediately aiming there, can''t we somehow aim it</span> <span m=''2112000''>so
  that by luck, we just, at the next step just</span> <span m=''2115000''>lands us
  back on the curve again?</span> </p><p><span m=''2117000''>In other words, with
  sort of looking for the</span> <span m=''2120000''>short path, a shortcut path,
  which by good luck will end us</span> <span m=''2124000''>up back on the curve again.
  And, all the simple</span> <span m=''2127000''>improvements on the Euler method,
  and they are the most</span> <span m=''2131000''>stable in ways to solve differential
  equations</span> <span m=''2134000''>numerically, aim at finding a better slope.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2139000''>So, they find a better value for a better slope,</span>
  <span m=''2143000''>find a better value than An. Try to improve that slope that</span>
  <span m=''2148000''>you found. Now, once you have the idea</span> <span m=''2152000''>that
  you should look for a better slope,</span> <span m=''2155000''>it''s not very difficult
  to see what, in fact,</span> <span m=''2159000''>you should try. Again, I think
  most of you</span> <span m=''2163000''>would say, hey, I would have thought of that.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2167000''>And, you would be closer in time, since these methods
  were</span> <span m=''2171000''>only found about around the turn of the last century
  is when I</span> <span m=''2175000''>place them, mostly by some German mathematicians
  interested</span> <span m=''2180000''>in solving equations numerically.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2182000''>All right, so what is the better method?</span> </p><p><span m=''2185000''>Our
  better slope, what should we look for in our</span> <span m=''2188000''>better slope?
  Well, the simplest procedure</span> <span m=''2193000''>is, once again, we are starting
  from there,</span> <span m=''2196000''>and the Euler slope would be the same as
  a line element.</span> </p><p><span m=''2201000''>So, the line element looks like
  this.</span> </p><p><span m=''2204000''>And, our yellow slope, A, and I''ll still
  continue to</span> <span m=''2208000''>call it An, goes like that, gets to here.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2211000''>Okay, now if it were convex, if the curve were convex,</span>
  <span m=''2215000''>this would be too low. And therefore,</span> <span m=''2218000''>the
  next step would be, I''m going to draw this next</span> <span m=''2222000''>step
  in pink. Well, let''s continue in here,</span> <span m=''2227000''>would be going
  up like that. I''ll call this Bn,</span> <span m=''2230000''>just because it''s
  the next step of Euler''s method.</span> </p><p><span m=''2234000''>It could be
  called An prime or something like that.</span> </p><p><span m=''2239000''>But this
  will do. And now what you do is,</span> <span m=''2242000''>let me put an arrow
  on it to indicate parallelness,</span> <span m=''2246000''>go back to the beginning,
  draw this parallel to Bn.</span> </p><p><span m=''2251000''>So, here is Bn. Again,
  just a line of that same</span> <span m=''2255000''>slope. And now, what you should
  use as</span> <span m=''2258000''>the simplest improvement on Euler''s method,</span>
  <span m=''2262000''>is take the average of these two because that''s more likely</span>
  <span m=''2268000''>to hit the curve than An will, which is sure to be too low if</span>
  <span m=''2274000''>the curve is convex. In other words,</span> <span m=''2277000''>use
  this instead. Use that.</span> </p><p><span m=''2279000''>So, this is our better
  slope. Okay, what will we call that</span> <span m=''2286000''>slope? We don''t
  have to call it</span> <span m=''2288000''>anything. What were the equations for
  the</span> <span m=''2291000''>method be? Well, x n plus one</span> <span m=''2294000''>is
  gotten by adding the step size.</span> </p><p><span m=''2297000''>So, here''s my
  step size just as it was before.</span> </p><p><span m=''2300000''>Just as it was
  before, the new thing is how to get the</span> <span m=''2305000''>new value of
  y. So, y n plus one</span> <span m=''2308000''>should be the old yn, plus h times
  not this crummy</span> <span m=''2312000''>slope, An, but the better, the pink slope.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2317000''>What''s the formula for the pink slope?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2319000''>Well, let''s do it in two steps. It''s the average of An and Bn.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2324000''>Hey, but you didn''t tell me, or I didn''t tell you what
  Bn</span> <span m=''2328000''>was. So, you now must tell the</span> <span m=''2330000''>computer,
  oh yes, by the way, you remember that</span> <span m=''2334000''>An was what it
  always was. The interesting thing is,</span> <span m=''2338000''>what is Bn? Well,
  to get Bn,</span> <span m=''2341000''>Bn is the slope of the line element at this
  new point.</span> </p><p><span m=''2345000''>Now, what am I going to call that new
  point?</span> </p><p><span m=''2348000''>I don''t want to call this y value, y n
  plus one,</span> <span m=''2352000''>because that''s, it''s this up here that''s
  going</span> <span m=''2356000''>to be the y n plus one. All this is,</span> <span
  m=''2358000''>is a temporary value used to make another calculation,</span> <span
  m=''2362000''>which will then be combined with the previous calculations</span>
  <span m=''2367000''>to get the right value. Therefore, give it a temporary</span>
  <span m=''2371000''>name. That point, we''ll call it,</span> <span m=''2374000''>it''s
  not going to be the final, the real y n plus one.</span> </p><p><span m=''2378000''>We''ll
  call it y n plus one</span> <span m=''2380000''>twiddle, y n plus one temporary.
  And, what''s the formula for it?</span> </p><p><span m=''2384000''>Well, it''s just
  going to be what the original Euler formula;</span> <span m=''2388000''>it''s going
  to be y n plus what you would have gotten if you had</span> <span m=''2392000''>calculated,
  in other words, it''s the point that the Euler</span> <span m=''2396000''>method
  produced, but it''s not,</span> <span m=''2397000''>finally, the point that we want.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2401000''>Now, do I have to say anything else?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2404000''>Yeah, I didn''t tell the computer what Bn was.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2408000''>Okay, Bn is the slope of the direction field at the point n</span>
  <span m=''2414000''>plus one. And the computer knows what</span> <span m=''2419000''>that
  is. And, this point,</span> <span m=''2421000''>y n plus one temporary.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2424000''>So, you make a temporary choice of this, calculate that number,</span>
  <span m=''2431000''>and then go back, and as it were,</span> <span m=''2434000''>correct
  that value to this value by using this better</span> <span m=''2439000''>slope.
  Now, that''s all there is to the</span> <span m=''2444000''>method, except I didn''t
  give you its name.</span> </p><p><span m=''2448000''>Well, it has three names, four
  names in fact.</span> </p><p><span m=''2452000''>Which one shall I give you? I don''t
  care.</span> </p><p><span m=''2456000''>Okay, the shortest name is Heun''s method.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2460000''>But nobody pronounces that correctly.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2465000''>So, it''s Heun''s method. It''s called,</span> <span m=''2469000''>also,
  the Improved Euler method.</span> </p><p><span m=''2473000''>It''s called Modified
  Euler, very expressive word,</span> <span m=''2479000''>Modified Euler''s method.
  And, it''s also called RK2.</span> </p><p><span m=''2485000''>I''m sure you''ll
  like that name best.</span> </p><p><span m=''2491000''>It has a Star Wars sort of
  sound.</span> </p><p><span m=''2493000''>RK stands for Runge-Kutta, and the reason
  for the two is</span> <span m=''2498000''>not that it uses, well, it is that it
  uses two</span> <span m=''2502000''>slopes, but the real reason for the two is that
  it is a</span> <span m=''2506000''>second-order method. So, that''s the most important</span>
  <span m=''2510000''>thing to put down about it. It''s a second-order method,</span>
  <span m=''2515000''>whereas Euler''s was only a first-order method.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2520000''>So, Heun''s method, or RK2, let''s write it,</span> <span m=''2523000''>is
  the shortest thing to write, is a second-order method,</span> <span m=''2528000''>meaning
  that the error varies with the step size like some</span> <span m=''2533000''>constant,
  it will not be the same as the constant for Euler''s</span> <span m=''2539000''>method,
  times h squared.</span> </p><p><span m=''2542000''>That''s a big saving because
  it now means that if you halve the</span> <span m=''2548000''>step size, you''re
  going to decrease the error by a factor</span> <span m=''2553000''>of one quarter.
  You will quarter the error.</span> </p><p><span m=''2558000''>Now, you say, hey,
  why should anyone use</span> <span m=''2560000''>anything else? Well, think a little
  second.</span> </p><p><span m=''2564000''>The real thing which determines how slowly
  one of these methods</span> <span m=''2568000''>run is you look at the hardest step
  of the method and ask how</span> <span m=''2573000''>long does the computer take,
  how many of those hardest steps</span> <span m=''2577000''>are there? Now, the answer
  is,</span> <span m=''2579000''>the hardest step is always the evaluation of the
  function</span> <span m=''2584000''>because the functions that are common use are
  not x squared</span> <span m=''2588000''>minus y squared. They take half a page
  and have,</span> <span m=''2594000''>as coefficients, you know, ten decimal place</span>
  <span m=''2597000''>numbers, whatever the engineers doing it, whatever their</span>
  <span m=''2602000''>accuracy was. So, the thing that controls how</span> <span m=''2605000''>long
  a method runs is how many times the slope,</span> <span m=''2609000''>the function,
  must be evaluated.</span> </p><p><span m=''2613000''>For Euler, I only have to evaluate
  it once.</span> </p><p><span m=''2617000''>Here, I have to evaluate it twice.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2620000''>Now, roughly speaking, the number of function</span>
  <span m=''2624000''>evaluations will each give you the exponent.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2628000''>The method that''s called Runge-Kutta fourth order will</span> <span
  m=''2633000''>require four evaluations of slope, but the accuracy will be</span>
  <span m=''2639000''>like h to the fourth: very accurate.</span> </p><p><span m=''2645000''>You
  halve the step size, and it goes down by a factor of</span> </p><p><span m=''2650000''>16.
  Great. But you had to evaluate the slope four times.</span> </p><p><span m=''2654000''>Suppose,
  instead, you halve four times this thing.</span> </p><p><span m=''2659000''>And,
  what would you have done? You would have decreased it to</span> <span m=''2664000''>1/16th
  to what it was. You still would increase the</span> <span m=''2669000''>number of
  function evaluations you needed by four,</span> <span m=''2674000''>and you would
  have decreased the error by a 16th.</span> </p><p><span m=''2680000''>So, in some
  sense, it really doesn''t matter</span> <span m=''2683000''>whether you use a very
  fancy method, which requires more</span> <span m=''2687000''>function evaluations.
  That''s true.</span> </p><p><span m=''2690000''>The error goes down faster, but
  you are having to more work</span> <span m=''2694000''>to get it. So, anyway, nothing
  is free.</span> </p><p><span m=''2697000''>Now, there is an RK4. I think I''ll skip
  that,</span> <span m=''2701000''>since I wouldn''t dare to ask you any questions
  about it.</span> </p><p><span m=''2706000''>But, let me just mention it, at least,
  because it''s the</span> <span m=''2710000''>standard. It uses four evaluations.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2713000''>It''s the standard method, if you don''t want to do</span>
  <span m=''2717000''>anything fancier. It''s rather inefficient,</span> <span m=''2720000''>but
  it''s very accurate, standard method,</span> <span m=''2723000''>accurate, and you''ll
  see when you use the programs,</span> <span m=''2727000''>it''s, in fact, a program
  which is drawing</span> <span m=''2730000''>those curves, the numerical method which</span>
  <span m=''2733000''>draws all those curves that you believe in on the computer</span>
  <span m=''2738000''>screen is the RK4 method. The Runge-Kutta,</span> <span m=''2743000''>I
  should give them their names. Runge-Kutta,</span> <span m=''2747000''>fourth-order
  method. Two mathematicians,</span> <span m=''2751000''>I believe both German mathematicians
  around the turn</span> <span m=''2755000''>of the last century, Runge-Kutta fourth-order
  method</span> <span m=''2760000''>requires four slopes, requires you to calculate
  four</span> <span m=''2765000''>slopes. I won''t bother telling you what</span>
  <span m=''2769000''>you do, but it''s a procedure like that.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2771000''>It''s just a little bit more elaborate.</span> </p><p><span m=''2774000''>And
  you take two of these, you make up a weighted average</span> <span m=''2777000''>for
  the super slope. You use weighted average.</span> </p><p><span m=''2780000''>What
  should I divide that by to get the right...?</span> </p><p><span m=''2783000''>Six.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2784000''>Why six? Well, because if all these</span> <span m=''2786000''>numbers
  were the same, I''d want it to come out to be</span> <span m=''2789000''>whatever
  that common value was. Therefore, in a weighted</span> <span m=''2795000''>average,
  you must always divide by the sum of the coefficients.</span> </p><p><span m=''2800000''>So,
  this is the super-slope. And, if you plug that</span> <span m=''2804000''>super-slope
  into here, you will be using the</span> <span m=''2807000''>Runge-Kutta method,
  and get the best possible</span> <span m=''2811000''>results. Now, I wanted to spend
  the last</span> <span m=''2814000''>three minutes talking about pitfalls of numerical</span>
  <span m=''2818000''>computation in general. One pitfall I am leaving you on</span>
  <span m=''2824000''>the homework to discover for yourself.</span> </p><p><span m=''2828000''>Don''t
  worry, it won''t cause you any grief.</span> </p><p><span m=''2832000''>It''ll just
  destroy your faith in these things for the rest of</span> <span m=''2838000''>your
  life, which is probably a good thing.</span> </p><p><span m=''2842000''>So, pitfalls,
  number one, you find,</span> <span m=''2845000''>you''ll find. Let me talk,</span>
  <span m=''2847000''>instead, briefly about number two, which I am not giving you</span>
  <span m=''2853000''>an exercise in. Number two is illustrated by</span> <span m=''2857000''>the
  following equation. What could be simpler?</span> </p><p><span m=''2860000''>This
  is a very bad equation to try to solve numerically.</span> </p><p><span m=''2864000''>Now,
  why? Well, because if I separate</span> <span m=''2867000''>variables, why don''t
  I save a little time?</span> </p><p><span m=''2869000''>I''ll just tell you what
  the solution is, okay?</span> </p><p><span m=''2873000''>You obviously separate
  variables.</span> </p><p><span m=''2875000''>Maybe you can do it in your head.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2877000''>The solution will be, the solutions will have an</span>
  <span m=''2880000''>arbitrary constant in them, and they won''t be very</span> <span
  m=''2883000''>complicated. They will be one over c minus x.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2888000''>C is an arbitrary constant,</span> <span m=''2890000''>and as you
  give different values, you get,</span> <span m=''2893000''>now, what do those guys
  look like?</span> </p><p><span m=''2895000''>Okay, so here I am. I start out at
  the point,</span> <span m=''2898000''>one. And, I start out,</span> <span m=''2899000''>I
  tell the computer, compute for me the value of the</span> <span m=''2903000''>solution
  at one starting out at one.</span> </p><p><span m=''2905000''>And, it computes and
  computes a little while.</span> </p><p><span m=''2908000''>But the solution, how
  does this curve actually</span> <span m=''2911000''>look? So, in other words,</span>
  <span m=''2914000''>suppose I say that y of zero equals one.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2918000''>Find me y of two. In other words,</span> <span m=''2921000''>take
  a nice small step size. Use the Runge-Kutta</span> <span m=''2924000''>fourth-order
  method. Calculate a little bit,</span> <span m=''2928000''>and tell me, I just want
  to know what y of</span> <span m=''2931000''>two is. Well, what is y of two?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2933000''>Well, unfortunately, how does that curve look?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2936000''>The curve looks like this. At that point,</span> <span
  m=''2941000''>it drops to infinity in a manner of speaking,</span> <span m=''2944000''>and
  then sort of comes back up again like that.</span> </p><p><span m=''2947000''>What
  is the value of y? This is the point,</span> <span m=''2951000''>one. What is the
  value of y of two?</span> </p><p><span m=''2953000''>Is it here?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2955000''>Is it this? Well, I don''t know,</span> <span m=''2957000''>but I
  do know that the computer will not find it.</span> </p><p><span m=''2960000''>The
  computer will follow this along, and get lost in eternity,</span> <span m=''2965000''>in
  infinity, and see no reason whatever why</span> <span m=''2968000''>it should start
  again on this branch of the curve.</span> </p><p><span m=''2974000''>Okay, well,
  can''t we predict that that''s going to happen</span> <span m=''2978000''>somehow,
  avoid what I should have.</span> </p><p><span m=''2980000''>The whole difficulty
  is, this is called a singular</span> <span m=''2984000''>point. The solution has
  a singularity,</span> <span m=''2987000''>in other words, a single place where it
  goes to</span> <span m=''2991000''>infinity or becomes discontinuous,</span> <span
  m=''2993000''>maybe as a jump discontinuity. It has a singularity at x</span> <span
  m=''2997000''>equals c. This, in particular,</span> <span m=''3000000''>at x equals
  one here, but from the differential</span> <span m=''3004000''>equation, where is
  that c? There is no way of predicting</span> <span m=''3010000''>it. Each solution,</span>
  <span m=''3011000''>in other words, to this differential equation,</span> <span
  m=''3015000''>has its own, private singularity,</span> <span m=''3017000''>which
  only it knows about, and where it''s going to blow</span> <span m=''3021000''>up,
  and there''s no way of telling from the differential</span> <span m=''3025000''>equation
  where that''s going to be.</span> </p><p><span m=''3028000''>That''s one of the
  things that makes numerical calculation</span> <span m=''3032000''>difficult, when
  you cannot predict where things are going</span> <span m=''3037000''>to go bad in
  advance.</span> </p>'
