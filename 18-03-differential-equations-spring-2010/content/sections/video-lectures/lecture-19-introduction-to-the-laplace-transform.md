title: 'Lecture 19: Introduction to the Laplace Transform'
transcript: '<p><span m=''8000''>Today, and for the next two weeks, we are going to
  be</span> <span m=''11000''>studying what, for many engineers and a few</span> <span
  m=''14000''>scientists is the most popular method of solving any</span> <span m=''18000''>differential
  equation of the kind that they happen to be,</span> <span m=''22000''>and that is
  to use the popular machine called the Laplace</span> <span m=''26000''>transform.
  Now, you will get proficient in</span> <span m=''30000''>using it by the end of
  the two weeks.</span> </p><p><span m=''32000''>But, there is always a certain amount
  of mystery that hangs</span> <span m=''36000''>around it. People scratch their heads
  and</span> <span m=''38000''>can''t figure out where it comes from.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''41000''>And, that bothers them a lot. In the past,</span> <span m=''43000''>I''ve
  usually promised to tell you, the students at the end of</span> <span m=''47000''>the
  two weeks, but I almost never have time.</span> </p><p><span m=''50000''>So, I''m
  going to break that glorious tradition and tell you</span> <span m=''54000''>up
  front at the beginning, where it comes from,</span> <span m=''57000''>and then talk
  very fast for the rest of the period.</span> </p><p><span m=''62000''>Okay, a good
  way of thinking of where the Laplace transform</span> <span m=''66000''>comes from,
  and a way which I think dispels some of its</span> <span m=''70000''>mystery is
  by thinking of power series.</span> </p><p><span m=''73000''>I think virtually all
  of you have studied power series except</span> <span m=''77000''>possibly a few
  students who just had 18.01 here last semester,</span> <span m=''82000''>and probably
  shouldn''t be taking 18.03 anyway,</span> <span m=''85000''>now. But anyway, a power
  series</span> <span m=''88000''>looks like this: summation (a)n x to the n.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''91000''>And, you sum that from,</span> <span m=''95000''>let''s
  say, zero to infinity. And, the typical thing you want</span> <span m=''100000''>to
  do with it is add it up to find out what its sum is.</span> </p><p><span m=''104000''>Now,
  the only way I will depart from tradition,</span> <span m=''108000''>instead of
  calling the sum some generic name like f of x,</span> <span m=''112000''>in order
  to identify the sum with the coefficients,</span> <span m=''117000''>a, I''ll call
  it a of x.</span> </p><p><span m=''119000''>Now, I want to make just one slight
  change in that.</span> </p><p><span m=''125000''>I want to use computer notation,
  which doesn''t use the</span> <span m=''128000''>subscript (a)n. Instead, this,</span>
  <span m=''131000''>it thinks of as a function of the discreet variable,</span> <span
  m=''134000''>n. In other words,</span> <span m=''135000''>it''s a function which
  assigns to n equals zero,</span> <span m=''139000''>one, two, three real numbers.
  That''s what this sequence of</span> <span m=''143000''>coefficients really is.
  So, the computer notation will</span> <span m=''147000''>look almost the same. It''s
  just that I will write</span> <span m=''152000''>this in functional notation as
  a of n instead of (a)n.</span> </p><p><span m=''157000''>But, it still means the
  real number associated with the</span> <span m=''161000''>positive integer, n, and
  everything else is the</span> <span m=''165000''>same. See, what I''m thinking of
  this</span> <span m=''168000''>as doing is taking this discreet function, which
  gives me the</span> <span m=''173000''>sequence of coefficients of the power series,</span>
  <span m=''176000''>and associating that with the sum of the power series.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''182000''>Let me give you some very simple examples,</span> <span
  m=''185000''>two very simple examples, which I think you know.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''188000''>Suppose this is a function one. Now, what do I mean by that?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''193000''>I mean it''s the constant function, one.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''195000''>To every positive integer, it assigns the number one.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''199000''>Okay, what''s a of x? What I''m saying is,</span> <span m=''203000''>in
  other words, in this fancy,</span> <span m=''205000''>mystifying form, is all of
  these guys are one,</span> <span m=''208000''>what''s a of x? One plus x plus x
  squared plus</span> <span m=''213000''>x cubed. Look, you are supposed to be</span>
  <span m=''217000''>born knowing what that adds up to.</span> </p><p><span m=''219000''>It
  adds up to one over one minus x,</span> <span m=''223000''>except that''s the wrong
  answer. What''s wrong about it?</span> </p><p><span m=''227000''>It''s not true
  for every value of x.</span> </p><p><span m=''229000''>That''s only true when x
  is such that that series converges,</span> <span m=''234000''>and that is only true
  when x lies between negative one and</span> <span m=''238000''>one. So, it''s not
  this function.</span> </p><p><span m=''243000''>It''s this function with its domain
  restricted to be less</span> <span m=''247000''>than one in absolute value. What
  does that converge to?</span> </p><p><span m=''251000''>If x is bigger than one,
  the answer is it doesn''t</span> <span m=''256000''>converge. There''s nothing else
  you can</span> <span m=''259000''>put here. Okay, let''s take another</span> <span
  m=''261000''>function. Suppose this is,</span> <span m=''263000''>let''s see, one
  over n you probably won''t know.</span> </p><p><span m=''269000''>Let''s take one
  you will know, one over n factorial.</span> </p><p><span m=''273000''>Suppose a
  of n is the function</span> <span m=''275000''>one over n factorial,</span> <span
  m=''278000''>what''s a of x? So, what I''m asking is,</span> <span m=''281000''>what
  does this add up to when the coefficient here is one over</span> <span m=''286000''>n
  factorial?</span> </p><p><span m=''287000''>What''s summation x to the n over n
  factorial?</span> </p><p><span m=''291000''>It is e to the x.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''294000''>And, this doesn''t have to be qualified because this is true</span>
  <span m=''298000''>for all values of x. So, in other words,</span> <span m=''302000''>from
  this peculiar point of view, I think of a power as</span> <span m=''305000''>summing
  the operation, of summing a power series as</span> <span m=''309000''>taking a discreet
  function defined for positive integers,</span> <span m=''313000''>or nonnegative
  integers, and doing this funny process.</span> </p><p><span m=''316000''>And, out
  of it comes a continuous function of some</span> <span m=''320000''>sort. And, notice
  what goes in is the</span> <span m=''322000''>variable, n. But, what comes out is
  the</span> <span m=''325000''>variable, x. Well, that''s perfectly natural.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''329000''>That''s the way a power series is set up.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''332000''>So, the question I ask is, this is a discreet situation,</span> <span
  m=''338000''>a discreet summation. Suppose I made the summation</span> <span m=''343000''>continuous
  instead of discreet. So, I want the continuous</span> <span m=''348000''>analog
  of what I did over there. Okay, what would a continuous</span> <span m=''354000''>analog
  be? Well, instead of,</span> <span m=''357000''>I''ll replace n zero, one, two,
  that will be replaced</span> <span m=''362000''>by a continued, that''s a discreet
  variable.</span> </p><p><span m=''368000''>I''ll replace it by a continuous variable,
  t, which runs from</span> <span m=''373000''>zero to infinity, and is allowed to
  take every</span> <span m=''377000''>real value in between instead of being only
  allowed to take the</span> <span m=''382000''>values of the positive nonnegative
  integers.</span> </p><p><span m=''387000''>Okay, well, if I want to use t instead
  of n,</span> <span m=''390000''>I clearly cannot sum in the usual way over all real
  numbers.</span> </p><p><span m=''394000''>But, the way the procedure which replaces
  summation over</span> <span m=''398000''>all real numbers is integration. So, what
  I''m going to do is</span> <span m=''402000''>replace that sum by the integral from
  zero to infinity.</span> </p><p><span m=''406000''>That''s like the sum from zero
  to infinity of what?</span> </p><p><span m=''410000''>Well, of some function, but
  now n is being replaced by</span> <span m=''414000''>the continuous variable, t.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''415000''>So, this is going to be a function of t.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''420000''>And, how about the rest of it? The rest I will just copy,</span> <span
  m=''424000''>x to the n''th. Well, instead of n I have to</span> <span m=''427000''>write
  t and dt. And, what''s the sum?</span> </p><p><span m=''429000''>Well, I''ll call
  the sum, what''s the sum a function of?</span> </p><p><span m=''433000''>I integrate
  out the t. So, that doesn''t appear in the</span> <span m=''437000''>answer. All
  that appears is this</span> <span m=''439000''>number, x, this parameter, x.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''441000''>For each value of x, like one, two,</span> <span m=''443000''>or
  26.3, this integral has a certain value,</span> <span m=''446000''>and I can calculate
  it. So, this is going to end up as</span> <span m=''450000''>a function of x, just
  as it did before.</span> </p><p><span m=''455000''>Now, I could leave it in that
  form, but no mathematician would</span> <span m=''459000''>like to do that, and
  very few engineers either.</span> </p><p><span m=''462000''>The reason is, in general,
  when you do</span> <span m=''465000''>integration and differentiation, you do not
  want to have as the</span> <span m=''470000''>base of an exponential something like
  x.</span> </p><p><span m=''473000''>The only convenient thing to have is e, and
  the reason is</span> <span m=''477000''>because it''s only e that people really
  like to differentiate,</span> <span m=''481000''>e to the something. The only thing
  is that people</span> <span m=''485000''>really like to differentiate or integrate.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''488000''>So, I''m going to make this look a little better by converting
  x</span> <span m=''493000''>to the t to the base e. I remember how to do that.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''497000''>You write x equals e to the log x and so x to</span> <span
  m=''501000''>the t will be e to the log x times t,</span> <span m=''505000''>if
  you want. Now, the only problem is I want</span> <span m=''508000''>to make one
  more little change. After all, I want to be able to</span> <span m=''512000''>calculate
  this integral. And, it''s clear that if t is</span> <span m=''516000''>going to
  infinity, if I have a number here,</span> <span m=''519000''>for example, like x
  equals two,</span> <span m=''520000''>that integral is really quite unlikely to
  converge.</span> </p><p><span m=''524000''>For example, if a of t were just</span>
  <span m=''526000''>the constant function, one, the integral certainly</span> <span
  m=''529000''>wouldn''t converge. It would be horrible.</span> </p><p><span m=''532000''>That
  integral only has a chance of converging if x is a number</span> <span m=''536000''>less
  than one, so that when I take bigger and</span> <span m=''539000''>bigger powers
  of it, I get smaller and smaller</span> <span m=''542000''>numbers. Don''t forget,</span>
  <span m=''544000''>this is an improper integral going all the way up to</span> <span
  m=''548000''>infinity. Those need treatment,</span> <span m=''550000''>delicate
  handling. All right, so I really want x</span> <span m=''553000''>to be less than
  one. Otherwise, that integral is</span> <span m=''556000''>very unlikely to converge.
  I''d better have it positive,</span> <span m=''560000''>because if I allow it to
  be negative I''m going to get into</span> <span m=''563000''>trouble with negative
  powers, see what''s minus one,</span> <span m=''566000''>for example, to the one
  half when t is one</span> <span m=''569000''>half. That''s already imaginary.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''572000''>I don''t want that. If you''ve got an exponential,</span>
  <span m=''575000''>the base has got to be a positive number.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''578000''>So, I want x to be a positive number.</span> </p><p><span m=''581000''>All
  right, if x in my actual practices going to lie between</span> <span m=''584000''>zero
  and one in order to make the integral converge,</span> <span m=''588000''>how about
  log x? Well, log x,</span> <span m=''590000''>if x is less than one, so log x is
  going to be</span> <span m=''593000''>less than zero, and it''s going to go all
  the</span> <span m=''597000''>way down to negative infinity. So, this means log
  x is</span> <span m=''602000''>negative. In this interesting range of x,</span>
  <span m=''605000''>the log x is always going to be negative.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''608000''>And now, I don''t like that. The first place I''d like to</span> <span
  m=''611000''>call this by a new variable since no one uses log x as a</span> <span
  m=''615000''>variable. And, it would make sense to</span> <span m=''618000''>make
  it a negative, to make it negative,</span> <span m=''620000''>that is, to write
  log x is equal to negative s.</span> </p><p><span m=''624000''>Let''s put it on
  the other side, in order that since log x is</span> <span m=''628000''>always going
  to be less than zero, then s will always be</span> <span m=''632000''>positive.
  And it''s always more convenient</span> <span m=''635000''>to work with positive
  numbers instead of negative numbers.</span> </p><p><span m=''639000''>So, if I make
  those changes, what happens to the integral?</span> </p><p><span m=''642000''>Well,
  I stress, all these changes are just</span> <span m=''644000''>cosmetic to make
  things a little easier to work with in terms of</span> <span m=''648000''>symbols.
  First of all,</span> <span m=''649000''>the a I''m going to change. I don''t want
  to call it a of t</span> <span m=''652000''>because most people don''t call functions
  a of t.</span> </p><p><span m=''655000''>They call them f of t. So, I''ll call it
  f of t.</span> </p><p><span m=''658000''>x is e to the log x, which is e to the
  minus s.</span> </p><p><span m=''661000''>So, x has its name changed to e</span>
  <span m=''666000''>to the minus s. In other words,</span> <span m=''669000''>I''m
  using as the new variable not x any longer but s in order</span> <span m=''673000''>that
  the base be e. t, I now raise this to the t''th</span> <span m=''677000''>power,
  but by the laws of exponents, that means I simply</span> <span m=''681000''>multiply
  the exponent by t, and dt.</span> </p><p><span m=''684000''>And now, since I''m
  calling the function f of t,</span> <span m=''688000''>the output ought to be called
  capital F.</span> </p><p><span m=''692000''>But it''s now a function, since I''ve
  changed the</span> <span m=''695000''>variable, of s. It''s no longer a function
  of x.</span> </p><p><span m=''699000''>If you like, you may think of this as a of,</span>
  <span m=''702000''>what''s x? x is e to the negative s,</span> <span m=''706000''>I
  guess. I mean, no one would leave a</span> <span m=''709000''>function in that form.
  It''s simply a function of s.</span> </p><p><span m=''713000''>And, what is that?
  So, what have we got,</span> <span m=''717000''>finally? What we have,</span> <span
  m=''718000''>dear hearts, is this thing,</span> <span m=''720000''>which I stress
  is nothing more than the continuous analog of</span> <span m=''725000''>the summation
  of a power series. This is the discrete version.</span> </p><p><span m=''732000''>This
  is by these perfectly natural transformations the</span> <span m=''736000''>continuous
  version of the same thing.</span> </p><p><span m=''739000''>It starts with a function
  defined for positive values of</span> <span m=''743000''>t, and turns it into a
  function of s.</span> </p><p><span m=''746000''>And, this is called the Laplace
  transform.</span> </p><p><span m=''749000''>Now, if I''ve done my work correctly,
  you should all be</span> <span m=''754000''>saying, oh, is that all? But, I know
  you aren''t.</span> </p><p><span m=''757000''>So, it''s okay. You''ll get used to
  it.</span> </p><p><span m=''762000''>The first thing you have to get used to is
  one thing some people</span> <span m=''766000''>never get used to, which is you
  put in a function</span> <span m=''770000''>of t, and you get out a function of
  s.</span> </p><p><span m=''773000''>How could that be? You know, for an operator,</span>
  <span m=''776000''>you put in 3x, and you get out three if it''s a</span> <span
  m=''780000''>differentiation operator. In other words,</span> <span m=''784000''>when
  you have an operator, the things we''ve been talking</span> <span m=''788000''>about
  the last two or three weeks in one form or another,</span> <span m=''793000''>at
  least the variable doesn''t get changed.</span> </p><p><span m=''796000''>Well,
  but for a transform it does, and that''s why it''s called</span> <span m=''801000''>a
  transform. So, the difference between a</span> <span m=''804000''>transform and
  an operator is that for a transform a function</span> <span m=''809000''>of t comes
  in, but a function of s comes out.</span> </p><p><span m=''814000''>The variable
  gets changed, whereas for an operator,</span> <span m=''817000''>f of t goes in
  and what comes out is g of t,</span> <span m=''820000''>a function using the same
  variable like</span> <span m=''823000''>differentiation is a typical example of
  an operator,</span> <span m=''827000''>or the linear differential operators we''ve
  been talking</span> <span m=''830000''>about. Well, but this doesn''t behave</span>
  <span m=''832000''>that way. The variable does get changed.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''835000''>That''s, in fact, extremely important in the</span> <span m=''838000''>applications.
  In the applications,</span> <span m=''841000''>t usually means the time, and s very
  often,</span> <span m=''845000''>not always, but very often is a variable measuring
  frequency,</span> <span m=''850000''>for instance. But, so that''s a peculiar thing</span>
  <span m=''854000''>that''s hard to get used to. But, a good thing is the fact</span>
  <span m=''858000''>that it''s a linear transform. In other words,</span> <span m=''862000''>it
  obeys the laws we''d love and like that the Laplace</span> <span m=''866000''>transform--
  oh, I never gave you any notation</span> <span m=''870000''>for the laplace transform.
  Hey, I''d better do that.</span> </p><p><span m=''875000''>Okay, so, some notation:
  there are two notations that</span> <span m=''879000''>are used. Your book mostly
  uses the</span> <span m=''881000''>notation that the laplace transform of f of t
  is capital F</span> <span m=''885000''>of s, uses the same letter but with</span>
  <span m=''888000''>the same capital. Now, as you will see,</span> <span m=''891000''>there
  are some places you absolutely cannot use that</span> <span m=''894000''>notation.
  It may seem strange,</span> <span m=''896000''>looks perfectly natural. There are
  certain laws you</span> <span m=''899000''>cannot express using that notation.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''903000''>It''s baffling. But, if you can''t do it this</span> <span
  m=''905000''>way, you can do it using this notation instead.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''908000''>One or the other will almost always work.</span> </p><p><span m=''911000''>So,
  I''ll use my little squiggly notation, but that''s what I use.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''915000''>I think it''s a little more vivid, and the trouble is that</span> <span
  m=''919000''>this piles up too many parentheses.</span> </p><p><span m=''921000''>And,
  that''s always hard to read.</span> </p><p><span m=''923000''>So, I like this better.
  So, these are two alternate</span> <span m=''926000''>ways of saying the same thing.
  The Laplace transform of this</span> <span m=''932000''>function is that one. Okay,
  well, let''s use,</span> <span m=''936000''>for the linearity law, it''s definitely
  best.</span> </p><p><span m=''939000''>I really cannot express the linearity law
  using the second</span> <span m=''944000''>notation, but using the first notation,
  it''s a breeze.</span> </p><p><span m=''949000''>The Laplace transform of the sum
  of two functions is the sum</span> <span m=''954000''>of their Laplace transforms
  of each of them separately.</span> </p><p><span m=''960000''>Or, better yet, you
  could write it that way.</span> </p><p><span m=''963000''>Let''s write it this way.
  That way, it looks more like an</span> <span m=''966000''>operator, L of f plus
  L of g.</span> </p><p><span m=''970000''>And, of the same way, if you take a function
  and</span> <span m=''973000''>multiply it by a constant and take the laplace transform,</span>
  <span m=''977000''>you can pull the constant outside.</span> </p><p><span m=''979000''>And,
  of course, why are these true?</span> </p><p><span m=''982000''>These are true just
  because of the form of the transform.</span> </p><p><span m=''985000''>If I add
  up f and g, I simply add up the two</span> <span m=''989000''>corresponding integrals.
  In other words,</span> <span m=''993000''>I''m using the fact that the integral,
  this definite</span> <span m=''997000''>integral, is itself a linear operator.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1000000''>Well, that''s the general setting.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1003000''>That''s where it comes from, and that''s the notation for it.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1007000''>And, now we have to get to work.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1010000''>The first thing to do to get familiar with this is,</span> <span m=''1014000''>obviously
  what we want to do is say, okay, these were the</span> <span m=''1019000''>transforms
  of some simple discreet functions.</span> </p><p><span m=''1024000''>Okay, suppose
  I put in some familiar functions,</span> <span m=''1029000''>f of t. What do their
  Laplace</span> <span m=''1034000''>transforms look like? So, let''s do that.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1039000''>So, one of the boards I should keep stored.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1044000''>Why don''t I store on this board?</span> </p><p><span m=''1048000''>I''ll
  store on this board the formulas as we get them.</span> </p><p><span m=''1057000''>So,
  let''s see, what should we aim at,</span> <span m=''1059000''>first? Let''s first
  find,</span> <span m=''1061000''>and I''ll do the calculations on the sideboard,</span>
  <span m=''1064000''>and we''ll see how it works out. I''m not very sure.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1067000''>In other words, what''s the Laplace transform of</span>
  <span m=''1071000''>the function, one?</span> </p><p><span m=''1072000''>Well, there''s
  an even easier one.</span> </p><p><span m=''1074000''>What''s the Laplace transform
  of the function zero?</span> </p><p><span m=''1077000''>Answer: zero. Very exciting.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1080000''>What''s the Laplace transform of one?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1083000''>Well, it doesn''t turn out the constant anymore than it turned</span>
  <span m=''1087000''>out to be a constant up there. Let''s calculate it.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1091000''>Now, you can do these calculations carefully,</span> <span m=''1094000''>dotting
  all the i''s, or pretty carefully,</span> <span m=''1097000''>or not carefully at
  all, i.e.</span> </p><p><span m=''1099000''>sloppily. I''ll let you be sloppy after,</span>
  <span m=''1101000''>generally speaking, you could be sloppy unless the</span> <span
  m=''1105000''>directions tell you to be less sloppy or to be careful,</span> <span
  m=''1109000''>okay? So, I''ll do one carefully.</span> </p><p><span m=''1112000''>Let''s
  calculate the Laplace transform of one carefully.</span> </p><p><span m=''1116000''>Okay,
  in the beginning, you''ve got nothing to use with</span> <span m=''1120000''>the
  definition. So, I have to calculate the</span> <span m=''1123000''>integral from
  zero to infinity of one, that''s the f of t times</span> <span m=''1127000''>e to
  the negative s t, so I don''t have to</span> <span m=''1131000''>put in the one,
  dt.</span> </p><p><span m=''1132000''>All right, now, let me remind you,</span>
  <span m=''1134000''>this is an improper integral. This is just about the first</span>
  <span m=''1138000''>time in the course we''ve had an improper integral.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1141000''>But, there are going to be a lot of them over the next couple</span>
  <span m=''1146000''>of weeks, nothing but. All right, it''s an improper</span> <span
  m=''1150000''>integral. That means we have to go back</span> <span m=''1152000''>to
  the definition. If you want to be careful,</span> <span m=''1155000''>you have to
  go back to the definition of improper integral.</span> </p><p><span m=''1159000''>So,
  it''s the limit, as R goes to infinity,</span> <span m=''1161000''>of what you get
  by integrating only up as far as R.</span> </p><p><span m=''1164000''>That''s a
  definite integral. That''s a nice Riemann integral.</span> </p><p><span m=''1167000''>So,
  this is what I have to calculate.</span> </p><p><span m=''1171000''>And, I have
  to take the limit as R goes to infinity.</span> </p><p><span m=''1174000''>Now,
  how do I calculate that? Well, this integral is equal</span> <span m=''1177000''>to,
  that''s easy. It''s just integrating.</span> </p><p><span m=''1180000''>Remember
  that you''re integrating with respect to t.</span> </p><p><span m=''1183000''>So,
  s is a parameter. It''s like a constant,</span> <span m=''1185000''>in other words.
  So, it''s e to the minus s t,</span> <span m=''1188000''>and when I differentiated,</span>
  <span m=''1190000''>the derivative of this would have negative s.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1193000''>So, to get rid of that negative s, so the derivative is e to the</span>
  <span m=''1197000''>minus s t. You have to put minus s</span> <span m=''1200000''>in
  the denominator. And now, I''ll want to evaluate</span> <span m=''1205000''>that
  between zero and R. And, what do I get?</span> </p><p><span m=''1209000''>Well it
  is at the upper limit. So, it''s e to the minus s times</span> <span m=''1214000''>R
  minus, at the lower limit, it''s t is equal to zero,</span> <span m=''1219000''>so
  whatever s is, it''s one.</span> </p><p><span m=''1221000''>And that''s divided
  by this constant up front,</span> <span m=''1225000''>negative s. So,</span> <span
  m=''1228000''>the answer is, it is equal to the limit of,</span> <span m=''1232000''>as
  R goes to infinity, of e to the negative s R minus</span> <span m=''1237000''>one
  divided by minus s.</span> </p><p><span m=''1243000''>Now, what''s that? Well, as
  R goes to infinity,</span> <span m=''1247000''>e to the minus 2R, or minus 5R goes
  to zero,</span> <span m=''1252000''>and the answer is minus one over minus s.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1257000''>So, that''s one over s. And so, that''s our answer.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1262000''>Let''s put it up here. It''s one over s,</span> <span
  m=''1265000''>except it isn''t. I made a mistake.</span> </p><p><span m=''1270000''>Well,
  not mistake, a little oversight.</span> </p><p><span m=''1276000''>What''s the oversight?
  This is okay.</span> </p><p><span m=''1282000''>This is okay. This is okay.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1286000''>This is not okay. This is okay.</span> </p><p><span m=''1291000''>But
  that''s not okay. What''s wrong?</span> </p><p><span m=''1298000''>I did slight
  a verbal hand. Maybe some of you have picked</span> <span m=''1301000''>it up and
  were too embarrassed to correct me,</span> <span m=''1304000''>but I said like e
  to the minus 2R obviously goes to</span> <span m=''1308000''>zero, and e to the
  minus 5R goes to zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''1311000''>How about e to the minus
  minus 3 R?</span> </p><p><span m=''1314000''>Does that go to zero? No, that''s e
  to the 3R,</span> <span m=''1317000''>which goes to infinity.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1320000''>The only time this goes to zero is if s is a positive number.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1325000''>Minus s looks like a negative number, but it''s not,</span>
  <span m=''1330000''>if s is equal to minus two. So, this is only true if s is</span>
  <span m=''1336000''>positive because only if s is positive is this exponent really</span>
  <span m=''1342000''>negative and large, and therefore going to</span> <span m=''1346000''>infinity,
  going to zero as R goes to infinity.</span> </p><p><span m=''1350000''>So, the answer
  is not one over s.</span> </p><p><span m=''1354000''>It is one over s, s must positive.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1359000''>Now, once again, here, people don''t worry about</span>
  <span m=''1361000''>this sort of thing with power series because it seems very</span>
  <span m=''1365000''>obvious, you know, one over x,</span> <span m=''1368000''>absolute
  value of x is less than one,</span> <span m=''1371000''>when it gets to be the Laplace
  transform, just because the</span> <span m=''1374000''>Laplace transform is mysterious,
  the question is,</span> <span m=''1378000''>okay, the Laplace transform is one over
  s of one,</span> <span m=''1381000''>well, Laplace transform of one I understand
  is one over s if s</span> <span m=''1385000''>is positive. What is it if s is negative?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1389000''>Okay, right down in your little books, this, but that
  down,</span> <span m=''1395000''>what is it if s is negative, and write underneath
  that,</span> <span m=''1401000''>this question is meaningless. It doesn''t mean
  anything.</span> </p><p><span m=''1406000''>I''ll draw you a picture. This is a
  picture of the</span> <span m=''1411000''>Laplace transform of one. It is that.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1414000''>It''s one branch of this curve. It does not include the
  branch</span> <span m=''1419000''>on the left. It doesn''t because I showed you</span>
  <span m=''1423000''>it doesn''t. That''s all there is to it.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1426000''>Okay, so I did that carefully. Now I''m going to get a little</span>
  <span m=''1430000''>less careful. What''s the Laplace transform of</span> <span
  m=''1434000''>e to the a t? First of all,</span> <span m=''1437000''>in general,
  the kind of functions for which people like</span> <span m=''1441000''>to calculate
  the Laplace transform, and basically the</span> <span m=''1446000''>only ones there
  will be in the tables are exactly the sort of</span> <span m=''1450000''>functions
  that you used in solving linear equations with</span> <span m=''1455000''>constant
  coefficients. What kinds of functions entered</span> <span m=''1461000''>in there?
  Exponentials,</span> <span m=''1462000''>sines and cosines, but they were really
  complex</span> <span m=''1465000''>exponentials, right?</span> </p><p><span m=''1466000''>e
  to the t sine t, but that was really a</span> <span m=''1470000''>complex exponential,
  too, just a little more</span> <span m=''1473000''>complicated one, polynomials,</span>
  <span m=''1475000''>and that''s about it. t times e to the t,</span> <span m=''1478000''>that
  was okay, too.</span> </p><p><span m=''1481000''>These are the functions for which
  people calculate the</span> <span m=''1484000''>Laplace transform, and all the other
  functions</span> <span m=''1486000''>they don''t calculate the Laplace transforms.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1489000''>So, I don''t mean to disappoint you here.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1492000''>You''re going to say, oh, what, that same old stuff?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1495000''>For two more weeks, we''ve got that same,</span> <span m=''1497000''>well,
  the Laplace transform does a lot of things much better</span> <span m=''1501000''>than
  the methods we''ve been using.</span> </p><p><span m=''1504000''>And, I won''t.
  I''ll sell it when I get a</span> <span m=''1506000''>chance to, for now, let''s
  just get familiar with</span> <span m=''1509000''>it. All right, so while I''m not</span>
  <span m=''1511000''>going to calculate e to the a t for you,</span> <span m=''1514000''>because
  I''d like instead to just prove a simple formula</span> <span m=''1517000''>which
  will just give that, and will also give us e to the</span> <span m=''1521000''>a
  t sine t. It will give us a lot more,</span> <span m=''1524000''>instead. I''m going
  to calculate a</span> <span m=''1527000''>formula for the Laplace transform of this
  guy if you</span> <span m=''1530000''>already know the Laplace transform of it.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1534000''>Now, see, this falls in that category because this is
  really</span> <span m=''1538000''>e to the a t times one.</span> </p><p><span m=''1541000''>But,
  I already know the Laplace transform of one.</span> </p><p><span m=''1544000''>So
  that''s, if I can get a general formula for this,</span> <span m=''1548000''>I''ll
  be able to get the formula for e to the a t as a</span> <span m=''1553000''>consequence.
  So, let''s look for this Laplace</span> <span m=''1556000''>transform. Now, it''s
  really easy.</span> </p><p><span m=''1559000''>Let''s see, where am I doing calculations?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1562000''>Over here. Okay, so we''ve got e.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1565000''>So, I want to calculate the Laplace transform e to the a t f</span>
  <span m=''1569000''>of t. So I''m going to say that''s the</span> <span m=''1573000''>integral
  from zero to infinity of e to the a t times f of t.</span> </p><p><span m=''1576000''>And
  now, the rest I copy.</span> </p><p><span m=''1579000''>That''s the function part
  of it that goes to the input,</span> <span m=''1583000''>and then there''s the other
  part.</span> </p><p><span m=''1585000''>This part is called the kernel, by the way,
  but don''t worry</span> <span m=''1589000''>about that. However, if you drop it
  in</span> <span m=''1593000''>conversation, people will look at you and</span> <span
  m=''1596000''>say, gee, they know something I don''t.</span> </p><p><span m=''1599000''>And
  you will. You know that it''s the kernel.</span> </p><p><span m=''1603000''>Okay,
  well, now, what kind of formula can I be</span> <span m=''1607000''>looking for?
  Clearly, I can only be looking</span> <span m=''1611000''>for a formula which expresses
  it in terms of the Laplace</span> <span m=''1616000''>transform of f of t. Let''s
  calculate and see what we</span> <span m=''1622000''>get. Now, what would you do
  to that</span> <span m=''1624000''>thing to make? Well, obviously,</span> <span
  m=''1626000''>the thing to do is to combine the two exponentials.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1629000''>So, that''s going to be the integral from zero to infinity</span>
  <span m=''1633000''>of f of t. e, now, I''d like to put it,</span> <span m=''1636000''>to
  combine the exponentials in such a way that it has,</span> <span m=''1639000''>still,
  that same form, so, I''m going to begin with</span> <span m=''1643000''>that negative
  sign, and then see what the rest of</span> <span m=''1646000''>it has to be. What
  is it going to be?</span> </p><p><span m=''1650000''>Well, minus s t and plus a
  t,</span> <span m=''1654000''>but I can make that minus a here, and it will come
  out</span> <span m=''1659000''>right. So, it''s minus s t plus a t,</span> <span
  m=''1662000''>and there are the two parts,</span> <span m=''1666000''>those two
  factors, dt.</span> </p><p><span m=''1668000''>So, what''s that? That''s the Laplace
  transform.</span> </p><p><span m=''1672000''>If the a weren''t there, this would
  be the Laplace</span> <span m=''1676000''>transform of f of t. What is it with the
  a there?</span> </p><p><span m=''1683000''>It''s the Laplace transform of f of t,</span>
  <span m=''1688000''>except that instead of the variable, s has been replaced by</span>
  <span m=''1695000''>the variable s minus a.</span> </p><p><span m=''1699000''>I''ll
  give you a second to digest that.</span> </p><p><span m=''1704000''>Well, you digest
  it while I''m writing it because that''s the</span> <span m=''1710000''>answer.
  And, the way this is most often</span> <span m=''1715000''>used, I have to qualify
  it for the value.</span> </p><p><span m=''1718000''>So, if F of s is good for s
  positive,</span> <span m=''1722000''>the way it would be, for example,</span> <span
  m=''1725000''>if I used the function one here, then to finish that off,</span> <span
  m=''1730000''>then, F of s minus a will be,</span> <span m=''1733000''>this will
  be good when s is bigger than a.</span> </p><p><span m=''1737000''>Why is that?
  Well, because this is true.</span> </p><p><span m=''1742000''>This is true. If s
  minus a is</span> <span m=''1746000''>positive, that''s the condition. That''s what
  this Laplace</span> <span m=''1751000''>transform is good. But that simply says
  that s</span> <span m=''1755000''>should be bigger than a.</span> </p><p><span m=''1758000''>And,
  since this doesn''t look pretty, let me try to make it</span> <span m=''1763000''>look
  a little bit prettier. So, let''s write it.</span> </p><p><span m=''1769000''>So,
  this is assuming F of s is for s greater than zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''1774000''>Now,
  this is called something.</span> </p><p><span m=''1778000''>This is called, well,
  what would you call it?</span> </p><p><span m=''1783000''>On the left side, you
  multiply by an exponential.</span> </p><p><span m=''1787000''>On the right, you
  translate.</span> </p><p><span m=''1790000''>You shift the argument over by a.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1793000''>So, this is called, gulp, the exponential shift.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1798000''>What? Well, I''ll call it the formula.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1802000''>The thing before, when we talked about operators,</span> <span m=''1806000''>we
  called it the exponential shift rule or the exponential</span> <span m=''1810000''>shift
  law. But, in fact,</span> <span m=''1812000''>this is, in a way, a disguised form
  of the same</span> <span m=''1816000''>law. And, engineers who typically do</span>
  <span m=''1819000''>all their work using the Laplace transform and don''t use</span>
  <span m=''1823000''>operators, this is the form of the exponential shift law that</span>
  <span m=''1828000''>they would know. What you can do with one,</span> <span m=''1833000''>you
  can do with the other. You can now use both.</span> </p><p><span m=''1837000''>So,
  what''s the answer to e to the a t?</span> </p><p><span m=''1841000''>Well, the
  answer is, I''m supposed to,</span> <span m=''1844000''>e to the a t times one,
  the Laplace transform of one is</span> <span m=''1848000''>one over s. And, therefore,</span>
  <span m=''1851000''>what I do is to multiply by e to the a t, I change s to s</span>
  <span m=''1856000''>minus a . And so, that''s the answer.</span> </p><p><span m=''1860000''>Let''s
  see, what else don''t we know?</span> </p><p><span m=''1865000''>Well, how about
  sines and cosines?</span> </p><p><span m=''1868000''>Well, the way to do sines and
  cosines is by making the</span> <span m=''1875000''>observation that this formula
  also works when a is a complex</span> <span m=''1882000''>number. So, can use also
  for a a</span> <span m=''1886000''>complex number, for e to the a plus b i times
  t.</span> </p><p><span m=''1891000''>The Laplace transform of e to</span> <span
  m=''1897000''>the a plus b i times t is one over s minus a plus b i.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1903000''>And again, it will be for s bigger than a.</span> </p><p><span m=''1907000''>So,
  let''s calculate the Laplace transform of,</span> <span m=''1910000''>let''s say,
  well, I''ve got to cover up something.</span> </p><p><span m=''1914000''>Okay, so,
  that''s the Laplace transform.</span> </p><p><span m=''1917000''>I''ve got to remember
  that. So, let''s calculate the Laplace</span> <span m=''1922000''>transform of,
  let''s say, sine of a t</span> <span m=''1925000''>and cosine a t.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1928000''>What do you get for that? Well, just for a little</span> <span m=''1932000''>variety,
  we could do it by using that formula,</span> <span m=''1935000''>and taking its
  real and imaginary parts.</span> </p><p><span m=''1938000''>Since some of you had
  so much difficulty with the backwards</span> <span m=''1943000''>Euler formula,
  he is a good case where you</span> <span m=''1946000''>could use it. Suppose you
  want to calculate</span> <span m=''1949000''>the Laplace transform of cosine a t.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1955000''>Well, I''m going to write that using, I want to calculate
  using</span> <span m=''1959000''>complex exponentials. The way I will do it is by</span>
  <span m=''1963000''>using the backwards Euler formula.</span> </p><p><span m=''1965000''>So,
  this is e to the i a t plus e to the minus i a t divided by</span> <span m=''1970000''>two.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1972000''>Remember, the foreword Euler formula would say e to the
  i a t</span> <span m=''1977000''>equals cosine a t plus i sine a t.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1981000''>That expresses the complex</span> <span m=''1984000''>exponential
  in terms of sines and cosines.</span> </p><p><span m=''1987000''>This is the backward
  formula, which just read it backwards,</span> <span m=''1991000''>expressing cosines
  and sines in terms of complex exponentials</span> <span m=''1995000''>instead. Both
  formulas are useful,</span> <span m=''1997000''>almost equally useful, in fact.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1999000''>And anyway, just remind you of it, let''s use this one.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2003000''>Okay, what''s the Laplace transform, then,</span> <span
  m=''2006000''>of cosine a t? Well, by linearity,</span> <span m=''2010000''>it''s
  equal to one half the Laplace transform of this guy</span> <span m=''2015000''>plus
  the Laplace transform of that guy.</span> </p><p><span m=''2018000''>And, what are
  those? Well, the Laplace transform of</span> <span m=''2023000''>e to the i a t
  is one over s minus i a,</span> <span m=''2028000''>and the Laplace transform of
  the other guy is</span> <span m=''2033000''>one divided by s plus i a.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2036000''>Now, of course, this has become out to be a</span> <span m=''2040000''>real
  function. This is real.</span> </p><p><span m=''2043000''>Every integral is real.
  This must come out to be real.</span> </p><p><span m=''2047000''>This looks kind
  of complex, but it isn''t.</span> </p><p><span m=''2050000''>I know automatically
  that this is going to be a real function.</span> </p><p><span m=''2055000''>How
  I know that? Well, mentally,</span> <span m=''2057000''>you can combine the terms
  and calculate.</span> </p><p><span m=''2060000''>But, I know even before that. Remember,
  there are two ways to</span> <span m=''2064000''>see that something is real. You
  can calculate it and see</span> <span m=''2068000''>that its imaginary part is zero,
  hack, or without any</span> <span m=''2072000''>calculation, if you change i to
  minus i,</span> <span m=''2076000''>and you get the same thing, it must be real.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2081000''>Now, if I change i to minus i in this expression,</span>
  <span m=''2085000''>what happens? If I change i to minus i,</span> <span m=''2088000''>this
  term turns into that one, and this one turns into that</span> <span m=''2094000''>one.
  Conclusion: the sum of the two</span> <span m=''2097000''>is unchanged. And therefore,</span>
  <span m=''2099000''>this is real. Well, of course,</span> <span m=''2103000''>in
  the time I took to make that argument, I could have actually</span> <span m=''2107000''>calculated
  it. So, what the heck,</span> <span m=''2109000''>let''s calculate it? So, you do
  the high school</span> <span m=''2112000''>thing, and it''s this guy plus that guy
  on top,</span> <span m=''2115000''>which makes 2s. I on the bottom is the product</span>
  <span m=''2118000''>of those, which by now you should know the product of two</span>
  <span m=''2122000''>complex numbers. A product of a number and its</span> <span
  m=''2125000''>complex conjugate is the sum of the squares.</span> </p><p><span m=''2129000''>So,
  what''s the answer? The twos cancel,</span> <span m=''2131000''>and the answer is
  that the Laplace transform of cosine a t</span> <span m=''2135000''>is s over s
  squared plus a squared.</span> </p><p><span m=''2139000''>And, that will be true
  as,</span> <span m=''2141000''>in general, it''s true up there for positive values
  of s only.</span> </p><p><span m=''2146000''>And, the sine a t, you can calculate
  that in</span> <span m=''2149000''>recitation tomorrow. The answer to that is a
  divided</span> <span m=''2153000''>by s squared plus a squared.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2156000''>You would get the same answers if you took the real and</span> <span
  m=''2160000''>imaginary parts of that expression.</span> </p><p><span m=''2164000''>It''s
  another way of getting at the recitations tomorrow;</span> <span m=''2168000''>we''ll
  get practice in calculating other functions</span> <span m=''2171000''>related to
  these by using these formulas, and also from scratch</span> <span m=''2176000''>directly
  from the definition of the Laplace transform.</span> </p><p><span m=''2180000''>Well,
  there are two things which we still should do.</span> </p><p><span m=''2184000''>The
  first is I want to get you started with calculating inverse</span> <span m=''2189000''>Laplace
  transforms. And, the reason for doing that</span> <span m=''2193000''>is, in other
  words, I''ve started with f of t,</span> <span m=''2196000''>and we''ve been focusing
  on what is capital F of s?</span> </p><p><span m=''2200000''>But, you will find
  that when</span> <span m=''2202000''>you go to solve differential equations, by
  far,</span> <span m=''2205000''>the hardest part of the procedure is you get F of
  s.</span> </p><p><span m=''2209000''>The Laplace transform of the answer, and you
  have to convert</span> <span m=''2212000''>that back into the answer in terms of
  t that you were looking</span> <span m=''2216000''>for. In other words,</span> <span
  m=''2218000''>the main step in the procedure that you are going to be using</span>
  <span m=''2221000''>for solving differential equations is,</span> <span m=''2224000''>and
  the hardest part of the step will be to calculate</span> <span m=''2227000''>inverse
  laplace transforms. Now, you think that could be</span> <span m=''2233000''>done
  by tables, but, in fact,</span> <span m=''2235000''>it can''t unless the tables
  are too long to be useful.</span> </p><p><span m=''2239000''>You have to do a certain
  amount of work yourself.</span> </p><p><span m=''2243000''>And, the certain amount
  of work that you have to do yourself</span> <span m=''2248000''>involves partial
  fractions decompositions.</span> </p><p><span m=''2253000''>And, in case you were
  wondering which you are not,</span> <span m=''2256000''>the reason you learned partial
  fractions in 18.01 was not to</span> <span m=''2261000''>learn those silly integrals,
  but he learned it so that when</span> <span m=''2265000''>you got to 18.03 you would
  be able to calculate,</span> <span m=''2268000''>solve differential equations by
  using Laplace transforms.</span> </p><p><span m=''2273000''>Sorry. That''s life.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2274000''>Now, so a certain amount of the recitation time tomorrow
  will be</span> <span m=''2279000''>devoted to reminding you how to do partial fractions
  since you</span> <span m=''2283000''>haven''t done it in a while, and I assume,</span>
  <span m=''2286000''>yeah, we had that, I think.</span> </p><p><span m=''2290000''>Okay,
  now, they also remind you of the most efficient method,</span> <span m=''2296000''>which
  about half of you have had, and the rest think you</span> <span m=''2303000''>might
  have had, but really aren''t sure.</span> </p><p><span m=''2307000''>So, here''s
  the answer. We want to find out what it''s</span> <span m=''2313000''>inverse Laplace
  transform is. What you have to do,</span> <span m=''2319000''>it normally won''t
  be in the tables like this.</span> </p><p><span m=''2322000''>You have to put it
  in a form in which it will be in the tables.</span> </p><p><span m=''2326000''>As
  you do that, you have to make partial</span> <span m=''2328000''>fractions decompositions,
  which, to do it quickly,</span> <span m=''2331000''>so if you don''t know what I''m
  doing now, or you think you once</span> <span m=''2335000''>knew but don''t quite
  remember, go to recitation tomorrow.</span> </p><p><span m=''2339000''>To get the
  coefficient here, I cover up s,</span> <span m=''2342000''>and I put s equals zero
  because that''s the law.</span> </p><p><span m=''2347000''>To get this coefficient,
  I cover up s plus three and I</span> <span m=''2350000''>put s equals a negative
  three because that''s what you''re</span> <span m=''2354000''>supposed to do. Put
  s equal negative three,</span> <span m=''2357000''>you get minus one third. This
  is equal to that.</span> </p><p><span m=''2360000''>In this form, I don''t know
  what the inverse</span> <span m=''2363000''>Laplace form is, but in this form,</span>
  <span m=''2365000''>I certainly do know with the inverse Laplace transform</span>
  <span m=''2369000''>because the inverse Laplace transform is linear,</span> <span
  m=''2372000''>and because each of these guys especially occurs in those</span> <span
  m=''2376000''>tables. Well, what''s this?</span> </p><p><span m=''2380000''>Well,
  it''s whatever the Laplace transform of,</span> <span m=''2383000''>inverse Laplace
  transform of one over s is multiplied by one</span> <span m=''2389000''>third. Well,
  the inverse Laplace</span> <span m=''2391000''>transform of one over s is one. So,
  it''s one third times one.</span> </p><p><span m=''2396000''>How about the other
  guy? Minus one third,</span> <span m=''2400000''>the inverse Laplace transform of
  one over s plus three,</span> <span m=''2405000''>that''s this formula. a is negative
  three,</span> <span m=''2409000''>and that makes e to the minus 3t.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2413000''>So, if this was the Laplace transform of the solution to the</span>
  <span m=''2418000''>differential equation, then the solution in terms of t</span>
  <span m=''2422000''>was this function. Now, you''ll get lots of</span> <span m=''2426000''>practice
  in that. All I''m doing now is signaling</span> <span m=''2430000''>that that''s
  the most important and difficult step of the</span> <span m=''2434000''>procedure,
  and that, please, start getting practice.</span> </p><p><span m=''2440000''>Get
  up to snuff doing that procedure.</span> </p><p><span m=''2442000''>Okay, in the
  time remaining, I want to add one formula to</span> <span m=''2446000''>this list,
  and that is going to be the Laplace transform of,</span> <span m=''2450000''>we
  still haven''t done polynomials.</span> </p><p><span m=''2452000''>And now, to polynomials,
  because the Laplace transform</span> <span m=''2456000''>is linear, all I have to
  do is know what the Laplace transform</span> <span m=''2460000''>of, the individual
  term of a polynomial.</span> </p><p><span m=''2464000''>In other words, what the
  Laplace transform of t</span> <span m=''2467000''>to the n, where n is some positive</span>
  <span m=''2470000''>integer? Well, let''s bravely start</span> <span m=''2473000''>trying
  to calculate it. Integral from zero to infinity</span> <span m=''2477000''>t to
  the n e to the negative st dt.</span> </p><p><span m=''2482000''>Now, I think you
  can see that</span> <span m=''2486000''>the method you should use is integration
  by part because this</span> <span m=''2491000''>is a product of two things, one
  of which you would like to</span> <span m=''2495000''>differentiate a lot of times,
  in fact, and the other won''t</span> <span m=''2500000''>hurt to integrate it because
  it''s very easy to integrate.</span> </p><p><span m=''2504000''>So, this factor
  is going to be</span> <span m=''2508000''>the one that''s to be differentiated,</span>
  <span m=''2510000''>and this is the factor that will be pleased to integrate it.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2514000''>Let''s get started and see what we can get out of it.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2517000''>Well, this time I''m going to be, well, I''d better be
  a little</span> <span m=''2521000''>careful because there''s a point here that''s
  tricky.</span> </p><p><span m=''2526000''>Okay, the first step of integration by
  parts is you only</span> <span m=''2530000''>do the integration. You don''t do the</span>
  <span m=''2532000''>differentiation. Remember, the variable is t.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2535000''>The s is just a parameter. It''s just a constant.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2539000''>It''s hanging around, not knowing what to do.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2542000''>Okay, so the first step is you don''t do the differentiation.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2546000''>You only do the integration. Evaluate it between limits,</span>
  <span m=''2550000''>and then you put a minus sign before you forget to do it.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2556000''>And then, integral zero to infinity.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2558000''>Now you do both operations. So, it''s n t to the n</span> <span m=''2563000''>minus
  one, and you also do the</span> <span m=''2566000''>integration. Okay, let''s consider
  each of</span> <span m=''2569000''>these pieces in turn. Now, this piece,</span>
  <span m=''2572000''>well, there''s no problem with the lower limit,</span> <span
  m=''2575000''>zero, because when t is equal to zero, this factor is zero,</span>
  <span m=''2580000''>and the thing disappears as long as n is one or higher.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2586000''>So, it''s minus zero here at the lower limit.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2590000''>The question is, what is at the upper limit?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2595000''>So, what I have to do is find out, what is the limit?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2600000''>The limit, as t goes to infinity, that''s what''s</span> <span m=''2605000''>happening
  up there, of t to the n times e to the</span> <span m=''2610000''>negative s t divided
  by minus s.</span> </p><p><span m=''2617000''>Well, as t goes to infinity, this
  goes to infinity,</span> <span m=''2620000''>of course. This had better go to zero</span>
  <span m=''2623000''>unless I want an answer, infinity, which won''t do me any</span>
  <span m=''2626000''>good. If this goes to zero,</span> <span m=''2628000''>s had
  better be positive. So, I''d better be restricting</span> <span m=''2632000''>myself
  to that case. Okay, so let''s assume that s is</span> <span m=''2636000''>positive
  so that this minus s really is a negative number.</span> </p><p><span m=''2641000''>Okay,
  then I have a chance. So, this is going to be the</span> <span m=''2644000''>limit.
  Let''s write it in a more</span> <span m=''2646000''>familiar form with that down
  below.</span> </p><p><span m=''2648000''>So, it''s t to the n. That''s going to
  infinity.</span> </p><p><span m=''2652000''>But, the bottom is e to the minus s
  t.</span> </p><p><span m=''2655000''>But now, it''s plus s t. And, that''s going
  to infinity,</span> <span m=''2659000''>too, because s is positive. So, the two
  guys are racing,</span> <span m=''2663000''>and the question is, oh, I lost a minus
  s here.</span> </p><p><span m=''2666000''>So, oh... equals minus one over s.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2670000''>How''s that? So, the question is only,</span> <span m=''2673000''>which
  guy wins? In the race to infinity,</span> <span m=''2675000''>which one wins, and
  how do you decide?</span> </p><p><span m=''2678000''>And, the answer, of course,
  is that''s the bottom</span> <span m=''2681000''>that wins. The exponential always
  wins,</span> <span m=''2683000''>and it''s because of L''Hopital''s rule.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2685000''>You differentiate top and bottom.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2687000''>Nothing much happens to the bottom.</span> </p><p><span m=''2689000''>It
  gets another factor of s, but the top goes down to t to</span> <span m=''2693000''>the
  n minus one. L''Hopital it again,</span> <span m=''2696000''>and again, and again,
  and again, and again until</span> <span m=''2699000''>finally you''ve reduced the
  top to t to the zero where it''s</span> <span m=''2703000''>defenseless and just
  sitting there, and nothing''s happened to</span> <span m=''2706000''>the bottom.
  It''s still got e to the s t.</span> </p><p><span m=''2711000''>and that goes to
  infinity.</span> </p><p><span m=''2714000''>So, the answer is, this is zero by n
  applications</span> <span m=''2719000''>of L''Hopital''s rule. Or, if you''re very
  clever,</span> <span m=''2723000''>you can do it in one, but I won''t tell you how.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2727000''>So, the answer is that this is zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2732000''>At the upper limit, it''s also zero at least if s is</span> <span
  m=''2735000''>positive, which is the case we''re considering.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2738000''>That leaves the rest of this. All right, let''s pull the</span> <span
  m=''2741000''>constants out front. That''s plus.</span> </p><p><span m=''2743000''>Two
  negatives make a plus. n over s,</span> <span m=''2746000''>now, what''s left? The
  integral from zero to</span> <span m=''2749000''>infinity of t to the n minus one,
  e to the minus s t dt.</span> </p><p><span m=''2757000''>But, what on Earth is that?
  That is n over s times</span> <span m=''2760000''>the Laplace transform of t to
  the n minus one.</span> </p><p><span m=''2764000''>We got a reduction for it. We
  don''t get the answer in one</span> <span m=''2768000''>step. But, we get a reduction</span>
  <span m=''2771000''>formula. And, it says that the Laplace</span> <span m=''2773000''>transform,
  let me write it this way for once.</span> </p><p><span m=''2776000''>The first way
  is now better, is equal to n over s times the</span> <span m=''2780000''>Laplace
  transform of n minus t to the n minus one.</span> </p><p><span m=''2784000''>Okay,
  the next step,</span> <span m=''2787000''>this would be n over s times n minus one
  over s times the</span> <span m=''2790000''>Laplace transform of t to the n minus
  two.</span> </p><p><span m=''2794000''>If I can continue,</span> <span m=''2798000''>I
  finally get in the top n times n minus one times all the</span> <span m=''2804000''>way
  down to one divided by the same number of s''s,</span> <span m=''2808000''>n of
  them, times the Laplace transform of t to the zero,</span> <span m=''2813000''>finally.
  See, one, zero,</span> <span m=''2815000''>n minus one. And so, what''s the final</span>
  <span m=''2819000''>answer? It is n factorial over s to the</span> <span m=''2822000''>what
  power? Well, the Laplace transform of</span> <span m=''2827000''>this is one over
  s. So, the answer is it''s s to the</span> <span m=''2833000''>n plus one, n of
  them here plus an extra</span> <span m=''2838000''>one coming from the one over
  s here.</span> </p><p><span m=''2841000''>And, that''s the answer. The Laplace transform
  of t to</span> <span m=''2846000''>the n, oddly enough,</span> <span m=''2849000''>is
  more complicated, and looks a little different</span> <span m=''2853000''>from these.
  It''s n factorial over s to the</span> <span m=''2857000''>n plus one.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2860000''>And, with that, you can now calculate the</span> <span m=''2863000''>Laplace
  transform of anything in sight, and tomorrow you will.</span> </p>'
