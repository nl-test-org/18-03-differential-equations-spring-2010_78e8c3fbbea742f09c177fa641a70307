title: 'Lecture 25: Homogeneous Linear Systems with Constant Coefficients'
transcript: <p><span m='0'>The last time I spent solving a system of equations dealing
  with</span> <span m='4000'>the chilling of this hardboiled egg being put in an ice
  bath.</span> </p><p><span m='9000'>We called T1 the temperature of the yoke and
  T2 the temperature</span> <span m='14000'>of the white. What I am going to do is</span>
  <span m='17000'>revisit that same system of equations, but basically the</span>
  <span m='21000'>topic for today is to learn to solve that system of equations</span>
  <span m='26000'>by a completely different method.</span> </p><p><span m='30000'>It
  is the method that is normally used in practice.</span> </p><p><span m='34000'>Elimination
  is used mostly by people who have forgotten how to</span> <span m='39000'>do it
  any other way. Now, in order to make it a</span> <span m='43000'>little more general,
  I am not going to use the</span> <span m='46000'>dependent variables T1 and T2 because
  they suggest temperature</span> <span m='52000'>a little too closely. Let's change
  them to neutral</span> <span m='56000'>variables. I will use x equals T1,</span>
  <span m='60000'>and for T2 I will just use y.</span> </p><p><span m='62000'>I am
  not going to re-derive anything.</span> </p><p><span m='65000'>I am not going to
  resolve anything.</span> </p><p><span m='68000'>I am not going to repeat anything
  of what I did last</span> <span m='72000'>time, except to write down to remind you
  what the system was</span> <span m='77000'>in terms of these variables, the system
  we derived using the</span> <span m='81000'>particular conductivity constants, two
  and three,</span> <span m='85000'>respectively. The system was this one,</span>
  <span m='88000'>minus 2x plus 2y. And the y prime was</span> <span m='94000'>2x
  minus 5y. And so we solved this by</span> <span m='98000'>elimination. We got a
  single second-order</span> <span m='102000'>equation with constant coefficients,</span>
  <span m='106000'>which we solved in the usual way.</span> </p><p><span m='109000'>From
  that I derived what the x was, from that we derived what</span> <span m='114000'>the
  y was, and then I put them all together.</span> </p><p><span m='120000'>I will just
  remind you what the final solution was when written</span> <span m='125000'>out
  in terms of arbitrary constants.</span> </p><p><span m='128000'>It was c1 times
  e to the negative t plus c2 e to the</span> <span m='133000'>negative 6t, and y
  was c1 over 2 e</span> <span m='138000'>to the negative t minus 2c2 e to the negative
  6t.</span> </p><p><span m='144000'>That was the solution we got.</span> </p><p><span
  m='150000'>And then I went on to put in initial conditions,</span> <span m='153000'>but
  we are not going to explore that aspect of it today.</span> </p><p><span m='156000'>We
  will in a week or so. This was the general solution</span> <span m='160000'>because
  it had two arbitrary constants in it.</span> </p><p><span m='169000'>What I want
  to do now is revisit this and do it by a</span> <span m='174000'>different method,
  which makes heavy use of</span> <span m='178000'>matrices. That is a prerequisite
  for this</span> <span m='182000'>course, so I am assuming that you reviewed a little
  bit about</span> <span m='186000'>matrices. And it is in your book.</span> </p><p><span
  m='189000'>Your book puts in a nice little review section.</span> </p><p><span m='192000'>Two-by-two
  and three-by-three will be good enough for 18.03</span> <span m='197000'>mostly
  because I don't want you to calculate all night on bigger</span> <span m='201000'>matrices,
  bigger systems. So nothing serious,</span> <span m='205000'>matrix multiplication,
  solving systems of linear</span> <span m='208000'>equations, end-by-end systems.
  I will remind you at the</span> <span m='214000'>appropriate places today of what
  it is you need to remember.</span> </p><p><span m='219000'>The very first thing
  we are going to do is,</span> <span m='223000'>let's see. I haven't figured out
  the color</span> <span m='226000'>coding for this lecture yet, but let's make this
  system in</span> <span m='231000'>green and the solution can be in purple.</span>
  </p><p><span m='235000'>Invisible purple, but I have a lot of it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='245000'>Let's abbreviate, first of all,</span> <span m='247000'>the system using
  matrices. I am going to make a column</span> <span m='251000'>vector out of (x,
  y).</span> </p><p><span m='253000'>Then you differentiate a column vector by differentiating
  each</span> <span m='258000'>component. I can write the left-hand side</span> <span
  m='262000'>of the system as (x, y) prime.</span> </p><p><span m='264000'>How about
  the right-hand side?</span> </p><p><span m='269000'>Well, I say I can just write
  the matrix of coefficients to</span> <span m='273000'>negative 2, 2, 2, negative
  5 times x,y.</span> </p><p><span m='278000'>And I say that this matrix equation
  says exactly the same</span> <span m='282000'>thing as that green equation and,
  therefore,</span> <span m='285000'>it is legitimate to put it up in green, too.</span>
  </p><p><span m='295000'>The top here is x prime. What is the top here?</span> </p><p><span
  m='300000'>After I multiply these two I get a column vector.</span> </p><p><span
  m='308000'>And what is its top entry? It is negative 2x plus 2y.</span> </p><p><span
  m='318000'>There it is.</span> </p><p><span m='322000'>And the bottom entry the
  same way is 2x minus 5y,</span> <span m='333000'>just as it is down there. Now,
  what I want to do is,</span> <span m='342000'>well, maybe I should translate the
  solution.</span> </p><p><span m='349000'>What does the solution look like?</span>
  </p><p><span m='358000'>We got that, too. How am I going to write this as a matrix
  equation? Actually, if I told you to use matrices, use vectors,</span> <span m='359000'>the
  point at which you might be most hesitant is this one right here, the very next
  step. Because how you should write it</span> </p><p><span m='360000'>is extremely
  well-concealed in this notation. But the point is, this is a column vector and I</span>
  </p><p><span m='361000'>am adding together two column vectors. And what is in each
  one of the column vectors?</span> </p><p><span m='362000'>Think of these two things
  as a column vector.</span> </p><p><span m='365000'>Pull out all the scalars from
  them that you can.</span> </p><p><span m='369000'>Well, you see that c1 is a common
  factor of both entries</span> <span m='374000'>and so is e to the negative t, that
  function.</span> </p><p><span m='378000'>Now, if I pull both of those out of the
  vector,</span> <span m='382000'>what is left of the vector? Well, you cannot even
  see it.</span> </p><p><span m='386000'>What is left is a 1 up here and a one-half
  there.</span> </p><p><span m='392000'>So I am going to write that in the following
  form.</span> </p><p><span m='395000'>I will put out the c1, it's the common factor
  in both,</span> <span m='398000'>and put that out front. Then I will put in the
  guts of</span> <span m='402000'>the vector, even though you cannot see it,</span>
  <span m='404000'>the column vector 1, one-half.</span> </p><p><span m='406000'>And
  then I will put the other</span> <span m='409000'>scalar function in back. The only
  reason for putting one</span> <span m='412000'>of these in front and one in back
  is visual so to make it</span> <span m='416000'>easy to read. There is no other
  reason.</span> </p><p><span m='420000'>You could put the c1 here, you could put
  it here,</span> <span m='423000'>you could put the e negative t in front if you
  want</span> <span m='427000'>to, but people will fire you. Don't do that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='430000'>Write it the standard way because that is the way that it</span>
  <span m='433000'>is easiest to read. The constants out front,</span> <span m='436000'>the
  functions behind, and the column vector of</span> <span m='439000'>numbers in the
  middle. And so the other one will be</span> <span m='442000'>written how? Well,
  here, that one is a</span> <span m='445000'>little more transparent. c2, 1, 2 and
  the other thing is</span> <span m='450000'>e to the negative 6t.</span> </p><p><span
  m='453000'>There is our solution. That is going to need a lot of</span> <span m='458000'>purple,
  but I have it.</span> </p><p><span m='467000'>And now I want to talk about how the
  new method of solving</span> <span m='470000'>the equation. It is based just on
  the same</span> <span m='472000'>idea as the way we solve second-order equations.</span>
  </p><p><span m='474000'>Yes, question.</span> </p><p></p><p><span m='484000'>Oh,
  here. Sorry. This should be negative two. Thanks very much.</span> </p><p><span
  m='487000'>What I am going to use is a trial solution.</span> </p><p><span m='490000'>Remember
  when we had a second-order equation with</span> <span m='493000'>constant coefficients
  the very first thing I did was I said we</span> <span m='497000'>are going to try
  a solution of the form e to the rt.</span> </p><p><span m='501000'>Why that? Well,
  because Oiler thought of</span> <span m='503000'>it and it has been known for or
  300 years that that is the</span> <span m='507000'>thing you should do. Well, this
  has not been known</span> <span m='512000'>nearly as long because matrices were
  only invented around</span> <span m='516000'>or so, and people did not really use
  them to solve systems of</span> <span m='521000'>differential equations until the
  middle of the last century,</span> <span m='525000'>1950-1960. If you look at books
  written in</span> <span m='528000'>1950, they won't even talk about systems of differential</span>
  <span m='533000'>equations, or talk very little anyway and they won't solve them</span>
  <span m='537000'>using matrices. This is only 50 years old.</span> </p><p><span
  m='542000'>I mean, my God, in mathematics that is very up</span> <span m='546000'>to
  date, particularly elementary mathematics.</span> </p><p><span m='549000'>Anyway,
  the method of solving is going to use as a trial</span> <span m='554000'>solution.
  Now, if you were left to your</span> <span m='558000'>own devices you might say,
  well, let's try x equals some</span> <span m='562000'>constant times e to the lambda1
  t and y</span> <span m='568000'>equals some other constant times e to the lambda2
  t.</span> </p><p><span m='573000'>Now, if you try that,</span> <span m='577000'>it
  is a sensible thing to try, but it will turn out not to</span> <span m='582000'>work.
  And that is the reason I have</span> <span m='585000'>written out this particular
  solution, so we can see what</span> <span m='589000'>solutions look like. The essential
  point is here is</span> <span m='593000'>the basic solution I am trying to find.</span>
  </p><p><span m='596000'>Here is another one. Their form is a column vector</span>
  <span m='600000'>of constants. But they both use the same</span> <span m='606000'>exponential
  factor, which is the point.</span> </p><p><span m='610000'>In other words, I should
  not use here,</span> <span m='614000'>in my trial solution, two different lambdas,</span>
  <span m='619000'>I should use the same lambda. And so the way to write the</span>
  <span m='626000'>trial solution is (x, y) equals two unknown numbers,</span> <span
  m='632000'>that or that or whatever, times e to a single unknown</span> <span m='638000'>exponent
  factor. Let's call it lambda t.</span> </p><p><span m='643000'>It is called lambda.
  It is called r.</span> </p><p><span m='646000'>It is called m. I have never seen
  it called</span> <span m='649000'>anything but one of those three things.</span>
  </p><p><span m='652000'>I am using lambda. Your book uses lambda.</span> </p><p><span
  m='655000'>It is a common choice. Let's stick with it.</span> </p><p><span m='660000'>Now
  what is the next step? Well, we plug into the system.</span> </p><p><span m='663000'>Substitute
  into the system. What are we going to get?</span> </p><p><span m='667000'>Well,
  let's do it. First of all,</span> <span m='669000'>I have to differentiate. The
  left-hand side asks me to</span> <span m='673000'>differentiate this. How do I differentiate
  this?</span> </p><p><span m='676000'>Column vector times a function. Well, the column
  vector acts as</span> <span m='680000'>a constant. And I differentiate that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='683000'>That is lambda e to the lambda t.</span> </p><p><span m='688000'>So
  the (x, y) prime is (a1, a2) times e to the lambda t</span> <span m='692000'>times
  lambda.</span> </p><p><span m='695000'>Now, it is ugly to put the</span> <span m='698000'>lambda
  afterwards because it is a number so you should put it in</span> <span m='702000'>front,
  again, to make things easier to read.</span> </p><p><span m='706000'>But this lambda
  comes from differentiating e to the lambda</span> <span m='710000'>t and using the
  chain rule.</span> </p><p><span m='713000'>This much is the left-hand side.</span>
  </p><p><span m='716000'>That is the derivative (x, y) prime.</span> </p><p><span
  m='720000'>I differentiate the x and I differentiated the y.</span> </p><p><span
  m='723000'>How about the right-hand side. Well, the right-hand side is</span> <span
  m='727000'>negative 2, 2, 2, negative 5 times what?</span> </p><p><span m='729000'>Well,
  times (x,</span> <span m='732000'>y), which is (a1, a2) e to the lambda t.</span>
  </p><p><span m='735000'>Now, the same thing that</span> <span m='738000'>happened
  a month or a month and a half ago happens now.</span> </p><p><span m='742000'>The
  whole point of making that substitution is that the e to</span> <span m='746000'>the
  lambda t, the function part of it drops</span> <span m='750000'>out completely.
  And one is left with what?</span> </p><p><span m='755000'>An algebraic equation
  to be solved for lambda a1 and a2.</span> </p><p><span m='759000'>In other words,
  by means of that substitution,</span> <span m='763000'>and it basically uses the
  fact that the coefficients are</span> <span m='768000'>constant, what you have done
  is reduced the problem of calculus,</span> <span m='773000'>of solving differential
  equations, to solving algebraic</span> <span m='778000'>equations. In some sense
  that is the only</span> <span m='782000'>method there is, unless you do numerical
  stuff.</span> </p><p><span m='785000'>You reduce the calculus to algebra.</span>
  </p><p><span m='788000'>The Laplace transform is exactly the same thing.</span>
  </p><p><span m='791000'>All the work is algebra. You turn the original</span> <span
  m='794000'>differential equation into an algebraic equation for Y of s,</span> <span
  m='799000'>you solve it, and then you use more algebra</span> <span m='802000'>to
  find out what the original little y of t was.</span> </p><p><span m='807000'>It
  is not different here. So let's solve this system of</span> <span m='812000'>equations.
  Now, the whole problem with</span> <span m='814000'>solving this system, first of
  all,</span> <span m='817000'>what is the system? Let's write it out explicitly.</span>
  </p><p><span m='821000'>Well, it is really two equations, isn't it?</span> </p><p><span
  m='824000'>The first one says lambda a1 is equal to negative 2 a1</span> <span m='829000'>plus
  2 a2. That is the first one.</span> </p><p><span m='832000'>The other one says lambda
  a2 is equal to 2 a1 minus 5 a2.</span> </p><p><span m='846000'>Now, purely, if you
  want to classify that,</span> <span m='849000'>that is two equations and three variables,
  three unknowns.</span> </p><p><span m='853000'>The a1, a2, and lambda are all unknown.</span>
  </p><p><span m='856000'>And, unfortunately, if you want to classify them</span>
  <span m='859000'>correctly, they are nonlinear equations because they are made</span>
  <span m='864000'>nonlinear by the fact that you have multiplied two of the</span>
  <span m='868000'>variables. Well, if you sit down and try</span> <span m='872000'>to
  hack away at solving those without a plan,</span> <span m='875000'>you are not going
  to get anywhere.</span> </p><p><span m='877000'>It is going to be a mess. Also,
  two equations and three</span> <span m='881000'>unknowns is indeterminate. You can
  solve three equations</span> <span m='886000'>and three unknowns and get a definite
  answer,</span> <span m='889000'>but two equations and three unknowns usually have
  an</span> <span m='893000'>infinity of solutions. Well, at this point it is the</span>
  <span m='896000'>only idea that is required. Well, this was a little idea,</span>
  <span m='902000'>but I assume one would think of that.</span> </p><p><span m='905000'>And
  the idea that is required here is, I think,</span> <span m='909000'>not so unnatural,
  it is not to view these a1,</span> <span m='913000'>a2, and lambda as equal. Not
  all variables are created</span> <span m='917000'>equal. Some are more equal than</span>
  <span m='920000'>others. a1 and a2 are definitely equal</span> <span m='923000'>to
  each other, and let's relegate lambda to</span> <span m='927000'>the background.
  In other words,</span> <span m='931000'>I am going to think of lambda as just a
  parameter.</span> </p><p><span m='934000'>I am going to demote it from the status
  of variable to</span> <span m='939000'>parameter. If I demoted it further it</span>
  <span m='941000'>would just be an unknown constant.</span> </p><p><span m='944000'>That
  is as bad as you can be. I am going to focus my</span> <span m='948000'>attention
  on the a1, a2 and sort of view the lambda</span> <span m='952000'>as a nuisance.
  Now, as soon as I do that,</span> <span m='955000'>I see that these equations are
  linear if I just look at them as</span> <span m='959000'>equations in a1 and a2.
  And moreover,</span> <span m='964000'>they are not just linear, they are homogenous.</span>
  </p><p><span m='967000'>Because if I think of lambda just as a parameter,</span>
  <span m='971000'>I should rewrite the equations this way.</span> </p><p><span m='974000'>I
  am going to subtract this and move the left-hand side to the</span> <span m='979000'>right
  side, and it is going to look like (minus 2 minus lambda)</span> <span m='983000'>times
  a1 plus 2 a2 is equal to zero.</span> </p><p><span m='988000'>And the same way for
  the other</span> <span m='992000'>one. It is going to be 2a1 plus,</span> <span
  m='995000'>what is the coefficient, (minus 5 minus lambda) a2</span> <span m='999000'>equals
  zero.</span> </p><p><span m='1003000'>That is a pair of simultaneous linear equations
  for determining</span> <span m='1008000'>a1 and a2, and the coefficients involved
  are parameter lambda.</span> </p><p><span m='1013000'>Now, what is the point of
  doing that?</span> </p><p><span m='1018000'>Well, now the point is whatever you
  learned about linear</span> <span m='1022000'>equations, you should have learned
  the most fundamental</span> <span m='1026000'>theorem of linear equations. The main
  theorem is that you</span> <span m='1030000'>have a square system of homogeneous
  equations,</span> <span m='1033000'>this is a two-by-two system so it is square,</span>
  <span m='1036000'>it always has the trivial solution, of course,</span> <span m='1040000'>a1,
  a2 equals zero. Now, we don't want that trivial</span> <span m='1044000'>solution
  because if a1 and a2 are zero, then so are x and y</span> <span m='1048000'>zero.
  Now that is a solution.</span> </p><p><span m='1052000'>Unfortunately, it is of
  no interest.</span> </p><p><span m='1055000'>If the solution were x, y zero, it
  corresponds to the</span> <span m='1059000'>fact that this is an ice bath. The yoke
  is at zero,</span> <span m='1064000'>the white is at zero and it stays that way
  for all time</span> <span m='1068000'>until the ice melts. So that is the solution
  we</span> <span m='1072000'>don't want. We don't want the trivial</span> <span m='1076000'>solution.
  Well, when does it have a</span> <span m='1079000'>nontrivial solution? Nontrivial
  means non-zero,</span> <span m='1083000'>in other words. If and only if this determinant</span>
  <span m='1089000'>is zero.</span> </p><p><span m='1098000'>In other words, by using
  that theorem on linear</span> <span m='1102000'>equations, what we find is there
  is a condition that lambda must</span> <span m='1108000'>satisfy, an equation in
  lambda in order that we would be able</span> <span m='1113000'>to find non-zero
  values for a1 and a2.</span> </p><p><span m='1118000'>Let's write it out. I will
  recopy it over here.</span> </p><p><span m='1121000'>What was it? Negative 2 minus
  lambda,</span> <span m='1124000'>two, here it was 2 and minus 5 minus lambda.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1129000'>All right. You have to expand the</span> <span m='1131000'>determinant.
  In other words,</span> <span m='1134000'>we are trying to find out for what values
  of lambda is this</span> <span m='1138000'>determinant zero. Those will be the good
  values</span> <span m='1143000'>which lead to nontrivial solutions for the a's.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1146000'>This is the equation lambda plus 2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1149000'>See, this is minus that and minus that, the product of the</span> <span
  m='1154000'>two minus ones is plus one. So it is lambda plus 2 times</span> <span
  m='1158000'>lambda plus 5,</span> <span m='1161000'>which is the product of the
  two diagonal elements,</span> <span m='1165000'>minus the product of the two anti-diagonal
  elements,</span> <span m='1169000'>which is 4, is equal to zero. And if I write
  that out,</span> <span m='1175000'>what is that, that is the equation lambda</span>
  <span m='1179000'>squared plus 7 lambda,</span> <span m='1183000'>5 lambda plus
  2 lambda, and then the constant term is</span> <span m='1188000'>10 minus 4 which
  is 6. How many of you have long</span> <span m='1192000'>enough memories, two-day
  memories that you</span> <span m='1196000'>remember that equation? When I did the
  method of</span> <span m='1202000'>elimination, it led to exactly the same equation
  except it had</span> <span m='1210000'>r's in it instead of lambda. And this equation,</span>
  <span m='1215000'>therefore, is given the same name and another color.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1221000'>Let's make it salmon.</span> </p><p><span m='1230000'>And it is called
  the characteristic equation for this</span> <span m='1234000'>method. All right.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1236000'>Now I am going to use now the word from last time.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1240000'>You factor this. From the factorization we get</span> <span
  m='1244000'>its root easily enough. The roots are lambda equals</span> <span m='1248000'>negative
  1 and lambda equals negative 6</span> <span m='1254000'>by factoring the equation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1257000'>Now what I am supposed to do? You have to keep the different</span>
  <span m='1263000'>parts of the method together. Now I have found the only</span>
  <span m='1268000'>values of lambda for which I will be able to find nonzero</span>
  <span m='1272000'>values for the a1 and a2. For each of those values of</span> <span
  m='1277000'>lambda, I now have to find the corresponding a1 and a2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1281000'>Let's do them one at a time. Let's take first lambda equals</span> <span
  m='1286000'>negative one. My problem is now to find a1</span> <span m='1292000'>and
  a2. Where am I going to find them</span> <span m='1295000'>from? Well, from that
  system of</span> <span m='1298000'>equations over there. I will recopy it over here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1302000'>What is the system? The hardest part of this is</span>
  <span m='1307000'>dealing with multiple minus signs, but you had experience</span>
  <span m='1312000'>with that in determinants so you know all about that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1318000'>In other words, there is the system of</span> <span m='1321000'>equations
  over there. Let's recopy them here.</span> </p><p><span m='1326000'>Minus 2, minus
  minus 1 makes minus 1.</span> </p><p><span m='1329000'>What's the other coefficient?
  It is just plain old 2.</span> </p><p><span m='1335000'>Good. There is my first
  equation.</span> </p><p><span m='1338000'>And when I substitute lambda equals negative
  one</span> <span m='1344000'>for the second equation, what do you get?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1350000'>2 a1 plus negative 5 minus negative 1 makes negative 4.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1357000'>There is my system that will find me a1 and a2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1363000'>What is the first thing you notice about it?</span> </p><p><span m='1368000'>You
  immediately notice that this system is fake because this</span> <span m='1376000'>second
  equation is twice the first one.</span> </p><p><span m='1383000'>Something is wrong.
  No, something is right.</span> </p><p><span m='1386000'>If that did not happen,
  if the second equation were not</span> <span m='1392000'>a constant multiple of
  the first one then the only solution of</span> <span m='1397000'>the system would
  be a1 equals zero, a2 equals zero because the</span> <span m='1403000'>determinant
  of the coefficients would not be zero.</span> </p><p><span m='1409000'>The whole
  function of this exercise was to find the value</span> <span m='1413000'>of lambda,
  negative 1, for which the system would be</span> <span m='1417000'>redundant and,
  therefore, would have a</span> <span m='1420000'>nontrivial solution. Do you get
  that?</span> </p><p><span m='1423000'>In other words, calculate the system out,</span>
  <span m='1427000'>just as I have done here, you have an automatic check on</span>
  <span m='1431000'>the method. If one equation is not a</span> <span m='1434000'>constant
  multiple of the other you made a mistake.</span> </p><p><span m='1440000'>You don't
  have the right value of lambda or you substituted</span> <span m='1445000'>into
  the system wrong, which is frankly a more common</span> <span m='1450000'>error.
  Go back, recheck first the</span> <span m='1453000'>substitution, and if convinced
  that is right</span> <span m='1457000'>then recheck where you got lambda from.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1460000'>But here everything is going fine so we can now find out
  what</span> <span m='1466000'>the value of a1 and a2 are. You don't have to go through
  a</span> <span m='1472000'>big song and dance for this since most of the time you
  will</span> <span m='1476000'>have two-by-two equations and now and then three-by-three.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1480000'>For two-by-two all you do is, since we really have the
  same</span> <span m='1484000'>equation twice, to get a solution I can assign</span>
  <span m='1487000'>one of the variables any value and then simply solve for the</span>
  <span m='1491000'>other. The natural thing to do is to</span> <span m='1494000'>make
  a2 equal one, then I won't need fractions and</span> <span m='1497000'>then a1 will
  be a2. So the solution is (2,</span> <span m='1501000'>1). I am only trying to find
  one</span> <span m='1504000'>solution. Any constant multiple of this</span> <span
  m='1507000'>would also be a solution, as long as it wasn't zero,</span> <span m='1512000'>zero
  which is the trivial one. And, therefore,</span> <span m='1515000'>this is a solution
  to this system of algebraic equations.</span> </p><p><span m='1520000'>And the solution
  to the whole system of differential equations</span> <span m='1525000'>is, this
  is only the (a1, a2) part.</span> </p><p><span m='1530000'>I have to add to it,
  as a factor,</span> <span m='1532000'>lambda is negative, therefore, e to the minus
  t.</span> </p><p><span m='1536000'>There is our purple thing.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1550000'>See how I got it? Starting with the trial</span> <span m='1552000'>solution,
  I first found out through this procedure what the</span> <span m='1557000'>lambda's
  have to be. Then I took the lambda and</span> <span m='1560000'>found what the corresponding
  a1 and a2 that went with it and</span> <span m='1564000'>then made up my solution
  out of that.</span> </p><p><span m='1566000'>Now, quickly I will do the same thing
  for lambda</span> <span m='1571000'>equals negative 6. Each one of these must be</span>
  <span m='1573000'>treated separately. They are separate problems and</span> <span
  m='1577000'>you are looking for separate solutions.</span> </p><p><span m='1579000'>Lambda
  equals negative 6. What do I do?</span> </p><p><span m='1582000'>How do my equations
  look now? Well, the first one is minus 2</span> <span m='1585000'>minus negative
  6 makes plus 4. It is 4a1 plus 2a2 equals zero.</span> </p><p><span m='1592000'>Then
  I hold my breath while I</span> <span m='1597000'>calculate the second one to see
  if it comes out to be a constant</span> <span m='1604000'>multiple. I get 2a1 plus
  negative 5 minus</span> <span m='1609000'>negative 6, which makes plus 1. And, indeed,</span>
  <span m='1614000'>one is a constant multiple of the other.</span> </p><p><span m='1620000'>I
  really only have on equation there.</span> </p><p><span m='1624000'>I will just
  write down immediately now what the</span> <span m='1629000'>solution is to the
  system. Well, the (a1,</span> <span m='1633000'>a2) will be what? Now, it is more
  natural to make</span> <span m='1639000'>a1 equal 1 and then solve to get an integer
  for a2.</span> </p><p><span m='1645000'>If a1 is 1, then a2 is negative 2.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1650000'>And I should multiply that by e to the negative 6t</span>
  <span m='1654000'>because negative 6 is the corresponding value.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1658000'>There is my other one. And now there is a</span> <span m='1661000'>superposition
  principle, which if I get a chance will</span> <span m='1664000'>prove for you at
  the end of the hour.</span> </p><p><span m='1667000'>If not, you will have to do
  it yourself for homework.</span> </p><p><span m='1671000'>Since this is a linear
  system of equations,</span> <span m='1674000'>once you have two separate solutions,
  neither a constant</span> <span m='1678000'>multiple of the other, you can multiply
  each one of</span> <span m='1682000'>these by a constant and it will still be a
  solution.</span> </p><p><span m='1688000'>You can add them together and that will
  still be a solution,</span> <span m='1691000'>and that gives the general solution.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1693000'>The general solution is the sum of these two,</span> <span
  m='1696000'>an arbitrary constant. I am going to change the name</span> <span m='1699000'>since
  I don't want to confuse it with the c1 I used before,</span> <span m='1702000'>times
  the first solution which is (2, 1) e to the negative t</span> <span m='1706000'>plus
  c2, another arbitrary constant, times 1 negative 2 e</span> <span m='1709000'>to
  the minus 6t.</span> </p><p><span m='1712000'>Now you notice that is exactly</span>
  <span m='1717000'>the same solution I got before. The only difference is that I</span>
  <span m='1723000'>have renamed the arbitrary constants.</span> </p><p><span m='1727000'>The
  relationship between them, c1 over 2,</span> <span m='1733000'>I am now calling
  c1 tilda, and c2 I am calling c2 tilda.</span> </p><p><span m='1740000'>If you have
  an arbitrary constant, it doesn't matter</span> <span m='1744000'>whether you divide
  it by two. It is still just an arbitrary a</span> <span m='1749000'>constant. It
  covers all values,</span> <span m='1752000'>in other words. Well, I think you will
  agree</span> <span m='1756000'>that is a different procedure, yet it has only one</span>
  <span m='1760000'>coincidence. It is like elimination goes</span> <span m='1764000'>this
  way and comes to the answer.</span> </p><p><span m='1768000'>And this method goes
  a completely different route and</span> <span m='1771000'>comes to the answer, except
  it is not quite like</span> <span m='1774000'>that. They walk like this and then</span>
  <span m='1776000'>they come within viewing distance of each other to check</span>
  <span m='1780000'>that both are using the same characteristic equation,</span> <span
  m='1784000'>and then they again go their separate ways and end up with</span> <span
  m='1788000'>the same answer.</span> </p><p><span m='1798000'>There is something
  special of these values.</span> </p><p><span m='1800000'>You cannot get away from
  those two values of lambda.</span> </p><p><span m='1803000'>Somehow they are really
  intrinsically connected.</span> </p><p><span m='1806000'>Occurs the exponential
  coefficient, and they are</span> <span m='1809000'>intrinsically connected with
  the problem of the egg that we</span> <span m='1812000'>started with. Now what I
  would like to do is</span> <span m='1815000'>very quickly sketch how this method
  looks when I remove all</span> <span m='1818000'>the numbers from it. In some sense,</span>
  <span m='1820000'>it becomes a little clearer what is going on.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1823000'>And that will give me a chance to introduce the terminology</span> <span
  m='1826000'>that you need when you talk about it.</span> </p><p><span m='1855000'>Well,
  you have notes. Let me try to write it down in</span> <span m='1863000'>general.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1870000'>I will first write it out two-by-two.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1873000'>I am just going to sketch. The system looks like (x,</span> <span m='1878000'>y)
  equals, I will still put it up in colors.</span> </p><p><span m='1890000'>Except
  now, instead of using twos and fives,</span> <span m='1893000'>I will use (a, b;
  c, d).</span> </p><p><span m='1900000'>The trial solution will look how?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1904000'>The trial is going to be (a1, a2).</span> </p><p><span
  m='1908000'>That I don't have to change the name of.</span> </p><p><span m='1913000'>I
  am going to substitute in, and what the result of</span> <span m='1919000'>substitution
  is going to be lambda (a1, a2).</span> </p><p><span m='1926000'>I am going to skip
  a step and pretend that the e to the lambda</span> <span m='1931000'>t's have already
  been canceled out.</span> </p><p><span m='1936000'>Is equal to (a, b; c, d) times
  (a1,</span> <span m='1939000'>a2). What does that correspond to?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1942000'>That corresponds to the system as I wrote it here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1948000'>And then we wrote it out in terms of two equations.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1951000'>And what was the resulting thing that we ended up with?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1955000'>Well, you write it out, you move the lambda to the</span> <span m='1958000'>other
  side. And then the homogeneous system</span> <span m='1961000'>is we will look in
  general how? Well, we could write it out.</span> </p><p><span m='1965000'>It is
  going to look like a minus lambda,</span> <span m='1968000'>b, c, d minus lambda.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1970000'>That is just how it looks there</span> <span m='1973000'>and
  the general calculation is the same.</span> </p><p><span m='1976000'>Times (a1,
  a2) is equal to zero.</span> </p><p><span m='1985000'>This is solvable nontrivially.
  In other words,</span> <span m='1993000'>it has a nontrivial solution if an only
  if the determinant of</span> <span m='2005000'>coefficients is zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2015000'>Let's now write that out, calculate out once and for all</span> <span
  m='2019000'>what that determinant is. I will write it out here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2023000'>It is a minus lambda times d minus lambda,</span> <span m='2026000'>the
  product of the diagonal elements, minus the</span> <span m='2030000'>anti-diagonal
  minus bc is equal to zero.</span> </p><p><span m='2035000'>And let's calculate that
  out.</span> </p><p><span m='2040000'>It is lambda squared minus a lambda minus d
  lambda plus ad,</span> <span m='2047000'>the constant term from here, negative bc
  from there,</span> <span m='2054000'>plus ad minus bc,</span> <span m='2061000'>where
  have I seen that before? This equation is the general</span> <span m='2069000'>form
  using letters of what we calculated using the specific</span> <span m='2076000'>numbers
  before. Again, I will code it the same</span> <span m='2085000'>way with that color
  salmon. Now, most of the calculations</span> <span m='2094000'>will be for two-by-two
  systems. I advise you,</span> <span m='2100000'>in the strongest possible terms,
  to remember this</span> <span m='2103000'>equation. You could write down this</span>
  <span m='2106000'>equation immediately for the matrix.</span> </p><p><span m='2108000'>You
  don't have to go through all this stuff.</span> </p><p><span m='2111000'>For God's
  sakes, don't say let the trial</span> <span m='2113000'>solution be blah, blah,
  blah.</span> </p><p><span m='2115000'>You don't want to do that. I don't want you
  to repeat the</span> <span m='2119000'>derivation of this every time you go through
  a particular</span> <span m='2123000'>problem. It is just like in solving</span>
  <span m='2125000'>second order equations. You have a second order</span> <span m='2129000'>equation.
  You immediately write down its</span> <span m='2132000'>characteristic equation,
  then you factor it,</span> <span m='2135000'>you find its roots and you construct
  the solution.</span> </p><p><span m='2139000'>It takes a minute. The same thing,</span>
  <span m='2142000'>this takes a minute, too.</span> </p><p><span m='2143000'>What
  is the constant term? Ad minus bc,</span> <span m='2147000'>what is that? Matrix
  is (a,</span> <span m='2149000'>b; c, d). Ad minus bc is its determinant.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2152000'>This is the determinant of that matrix.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2155000'>I didn't give the matrix a name, did I?</span> </p><p><span m='2160000'>I
  will now give the matrix a name A.</span> </p><p><span m='2163000'>What is this?
  Well, you are not supposed to</span> <span m='2167000'>know that until now. I will
  tell you.</span> </p><p><span m='2170000'>This is called the trace of A. Put that
  down in your little</span> <span m='2176000'>books. The abbreviation is trace A,</span>
  <span m='2179000'>and the word is trace. The trace of a square matrix is</span>
  <span m='2185000'>the sum of the d elements down its main diagonal.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2191000'>If it were a three-by-three there would be three terms in</span> <span
  m='2195000'>whatever you are up to. Here it is a plus b,</span> <span m='2200000'>the
  sum of the diagonal elements.</span> </p><p><span m='2203000'>You can immediately
  write down this characteristic equation.</span> </p><p><span m='2208000'>Let's give
  it a name. This is a characteristic</span> <span m='2212000'>equation of what? Of
  the matrix,</span> <span m='2215000'>now. Not of the system,</span> <span m='2217000'>of
  the matrix. You have a two-by-two matrix.</span> </p><p><span m='2222000'>You could
  immediately write down its characteristic</span> <span m='2226000'>equation. Watch
  out for this sign,</span> <span m='2228000'>minus. That is a very common error to</span>
  <span m='2231000'>leave out the minus sign because that is the way the formula</span>
  <span m='2235000'>comes out. Its roots.</span> </p><p><span m='2237000'>If it is
  a quadratic equation it will have roots;</span> <span m='2240000'>lambda1, lambda2
  for the moment let's assume are real and</span> <span m='2245000'>distinct.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2257000'>For the enrichment of your vocabulary, those are called
  the</span> <span m='2259000'>eigenvalues.</span> </p><p><span m='2270000'>They are
  something which belonged to the matrix A.</span> </p><p><span m='2273000'>They are
  two secret numbers. You can calculate from the</span> <span m='2276000'>coefficients
  a, b, and c, and d,</span> <span m='2278000'>but they are not in the coefficients.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2280000'>You cannot look at a matrix and see what its eigenvalues
  are.</span> </p><p><span m='2285000'>You have to calculate something.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2287000'>But they are the most important numbers in the matrix.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2290000'>They are hidden, but they are the things that</span> <span m='2293000'>control
  how this system behaves. Those are called the</span> <span m='2297000'>eigenvalues.
  Now, there are various purists,</span> <span m='2300000'>there are a fair number
  of them in the world who do not like</span> <span m='2304000'>this word because
  it begins German and ends English.</span> </p><p><span m='2309000'>Eigenvalues were
  first introduced by a German</span> <span m='2312000'>mathematician, you know, around
  the time</span> <span m='2315000'>matrices came into being in or so.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2318000'>A little while after eigenvalues came into being,</span> <span m='2321000'>too.
  And since all this happened in</span> <span m='2324000'>Germany they were named
  eigenvalues in German,</span> <span m='2327000'>which begins eigen and ends value.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2330000'>But people who do not like that call them the characteristic</span>
  <span m='2334000'>values. Unfortunately,</span> <span m='2336000'>it is two words
  and takes a lot more space to write out.</span> </p><p><span m='2342000'>An older
  generation even calls them something different,</span> <span m='2346000'>which you
  are not so likely to see nowadays,</span> <span m='2350000'>but you will in slightly
  older books.</span> </p><p><span m='2353000'>You can also call them the proper values.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2357000'>Characteristic is not a translation of eigen,</span> <span
  m='2361000'>but proper is, but it means it in a funny</span> <span m='2365000'>sense
  which has almost disappeared nowadays.</span> </p><p><span m='2370000'>It means
  proper in the sense of belong to.</span> </p><p><span m='2373000'>The only example
  I can think of is the word property.</span> </p><p><span m='2377000'>Property is
  something that belongs to you.</span> </p><p><span m='2380000'>That is the use of
  the word proper.</span> </p><p><span m='2383000'>It is something that belongs to
  the matrix.</span> </p><p><span m='2386000'>The matrix has its proper values.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2389000'>It does not mean proper in the sense of fitting and proper
  or I</span> <span m='2394000'>hope you will behave properly when we go to Aunt Agatha's
  or</span> <span m='2399000'>something like that. But, as I say,</span> <span m='2403000'>by
  far the most popular thing, slowly the word eigenvalue is</span> <span m='2407000'>pretty
  much taking over the literature.</span> </p><p><span m='2411000'>Just because it's
  just one word, that is a tremendous</span> <span m='2415000'>advantage. Okay.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2416000'>What now is still to be done? Well, there are those vectors</span>
  <span m='2421000'>to be found. So the very last step would be</span> <span m='2424000'>to
  solve the system to find the vectors a1 and a2.</span> </p><p><span m='2435000'>For
  each (lambda)i, find the associated vector.</span> </p><p><span m='2440000'>The
  vector, we will call it (alpha)i.</span> </p><p><span m='2444000'>That is the a1
  and a2. Of course it's going to be</span> <span m='2450000'>indexed. You have to
  put another</span> <span m='2453000'>subscript on it because there are two of them.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2460000'>And a1 and a2 is stretched a little too far.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2464000'>By solving the system, and the system will be the</span> <span m='2469000'>system
  which I will write this way, (a minus lambda,</span> <span m='2475000'>b, c, d minus
  lambda).</span> </p><p><span m='2479000'>It is just that system that was</span>
  <span m='2484000'>over there, but I will recopy it, (a1, a2) equals zero,</span>
  <span m='2490000'>zero. And these are called the</span> <span m='2494000'>eigenvectors.
  Each of these is called the</span> <span m='2499000'>eigenvector associated with
  or belonging to,</span> <span m='2504000'>again, in that sense of property.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2508000'>Eigenvector, let's say belonging to,</span> <span m='2512000'>I
  see that a little more frequently, belonging to lambda</span> <span m='2518000'>i.
  So we have the eigenvalues,</span> <span m='2521000'>the eigenvectors and, of course,
  the people who call</span> <span m='2524000'>them characteristic values also call
  these guys characteristic</span> <span m='2528000'>vectors. I don't think I have
  ever seen</span> <span m='2531000'>proper vectors, but that is because I am not</span>
  <span m='2533000'>old enough. I think that is what they used</span> <span m='2536000'>to
  be called a long time ago, but not anymore.</span> </p><p><span m='2540000'>And
  then, finally, the general solution will be,</span> <span m='2544000'>by the superposition
  principle, (x, y) equals the arbitrary</span> <span m='2550000'>constant times the
  first eigenvector times the eigenvalue</span> <span m='2555000'>times the e to the
  corresponding eigenvalue.</span> </p><p><span m='2560000'>And then the same thing
  for the second one, (a1,</span> <span m='2564000'>a2), but now the second index
  will be 2 to indicate that it</span> <span m='2570000'>goes with the eigenvalue
  e to the lambda 2t.</span> </p><p><span m='2576000'>I have done that twice. And
  now in the remaining five</span> <span m='2582000'>minutes I will do it a third
  time because it is possible to</span> <span m='2586000'>write this in still a more
  condensed form.</span> </p><p><span m='2589000'>And the advantage of the more condensed
  form is A,</span> <span m='2593000'>it takes only that much space to write, and
  B,</span> <span m='2596000'>it applies to systems, not just the two-by-two</span>
  <span m='2600000'>systems, but to end-by-end systems.</span> </p><p><span m='2603000'>The
  method is exactly the same. Let's write it out as it would</span> <span m='2607000'>apply
  to end-by-end systems. The vector I started with is</span> <span m='2614000'>(x,
  y) and so on, but I will simply abbreviate</span> <span m='2619000'>this, as is
  done in 18.02, by x with an arrow over it.</span> </p><p><span m='2625000'>The matrix
  A I will abbreviate with A, as I did before with</span> <span m='2631000'>capital
  A. And then the system looks like</span> <span m='2636000'>x prime is equal to --</span>
  <span m='2645000'>x prime is what? Ax.</span> </p><p><span m='2646000'>That is all
  there is to it.</span> </p><p><span m='2650000'>There is our green system. Now notice
  in this form I did</span> <span m='2655000'>not even tell you whether this a two-by-two
  matrix or an</span> <span m='2660000'>end-by-end. And in this condensed form it</span>
  <span m='2663000'>will look the same no matter how many equations you have.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2670000'>Your book deals from the beginning with end-by-end</span>
  <span m='2673000'>systems. That is, in my view,</span> <span m='2676000'>one of
  its weaknesses because I don't think most students start</span> <span m='2680000'>with
  two-by-two. Fortunately,</span> <span m='2683000'>the book double-talks. The theory
  is end-by-end,</span> <span m='2686000'>but all the examples are two-by-two.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2689000'>So just read the examples. Read the notes instead,</span>
  <span m='2693000'>which just do two-by-two to start out with.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2698000'>The trial solution is x equals what?</span> </p><p><span m='2701000'>An
  unknown vector alpha times e to the lambda t.</span> </p><p><span m='2707000'>Alpha
  is what we called a1 and</span> <span m='2711000'>a2 before. Plug this into there
  and cancel</span> <span m='2715000'>the e to the lambda t's.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2719000'>What do you get? Well, this is lambda alpha e to</span> <span m='2724000'>the
  lambda t equals A alpha e to the lambda t.</span> </p><p><span m='2736000'>These
  two cancel. And the system to be solved,</span> <span m='2740000'>A alpha equals
  lambda alpha.</span> </p><p><span m='2746000'>And now the question is how do you
  solve that system?</span> </p><p><span m='2751000'>Well, you can tell if a book
  is written by a scoundrel or not by</span> <span m='2757000'>how they go -- A book,
  which is in my opinion</span> <span m='2762000'>completely scoundrel, simply says
  you subtract one</span> <span m='2767000'>from the other, and without further ado
  writes</span> <span m='2772000'>A minus lambda, and they tuck a little I in</span>
  <span m='2776000'>there and write alpha equals zero.</span> </p><p><span m='2779000'>Why
  is the I put in there? Well, this is what you would</span> <span m='2785000'>like
  to write. What is wrong with this</span> <span m='2788000'>equation? This is not
  a valid matrix</span> <span m='2792000'>equation because that is a square end-by-end
  matrix,</span> <span m='2796000'>a square two-by-two matrix if you like.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2799000'>This is a scalar. You cannot subtract the scalar</span>
  <span m='2802000'>from a matrix. It is not an operation.</span> </p><p><span m='2805000'>To
  subtract matrices they have to be the same size,</span> <span m='2809000'>the same
  shape. What is done is you make this a</span> <span m='2812000'>two-by-two matrix.
  This is a two-by-two matrix</span> <span m='2816000'>with lambdas down the main
  diagonal and I elsewhere.</span> </p><p><span m='2821000'>And the justification
  is that lambda alpha is the same thing</span> <span m='2825000'>as the lambda I
  times alpha because I is an identity matrix.</span> </p><p><span m='2830000'>Now,
  in fact, jumping from here to here is</span> <span m='2833000'>not something that
  would occur to anybody.</span> </p><p><span m='2836000'>The way it should occur
  to you to do this is you do this,</span> <span m='2841000'>you write that, you realize
  it doesn't work,</span> <span m='2844000'>and then you say to yourself I don't understand
  what these</span> <span m='2849000'>matrices are all about. I think I'd better write
  it all</span> <span m='2853000'>out. And then you would write it all</span> <span
  m='2856000'>out and you would write that equation on the left-hand board</span>
  <span m='2859000'>there. Oh, now I see what it should</span> <span m='2861000'>look
  like. I should subtract lambda from</span> <span m='2864000'>the main diagonal.
  That is the way it will come</span> <span m='2867000'>out. And then say,</span>
  <span m='2868000'>hey, the way to save lambda from the main diagonal is put it</span>
  <span m='2871000'>in an identity matrix. That will do it for me.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2874000'>In other words, there is a little detour that</span> <span m='2877000'>goes
  from here to here. And one of the ways I judge</span> <span m='2881000'>books is
  by how well they explain the passage from this to</span> <span m='2885000'>that.
  If they don't explain it at all</span> <span m='2888000'>and just write it down,
  they have never talked to</span> <span m='2891000'>students. They have just written
  books.</span> </p><p><span m='2894000'>Where did we get finally here? The characteristic
  equation</span> <span m='2897000'>from that, I had forgotten what color.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2900000'>That is in salmon. The characteristic equation,</span>
  <span m='2903000'>then, is going to be the thing which says that the determinant</span>
  <span m='2907000'>of that is zero. That is the circumstances under</span> <span
  m='2912000'>which it is solvable. In general, this is the way the</span> <span m='2915000'>characteristic
  equation looks. And its roots,</span> <span m='2918000'>once again, are the eigenvalues.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2920000'>And from then you calculate the corresponding eigenvectors.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2924000'>Okay. Go home and practice.</span> </p><p><span m='2926000'>In
  recitation you will practice on both two-by-two and</span> <span m='2930000'>three-by-three
  cases, and we will talk more next</span> <span m='2933000'>time.</span> </p>
