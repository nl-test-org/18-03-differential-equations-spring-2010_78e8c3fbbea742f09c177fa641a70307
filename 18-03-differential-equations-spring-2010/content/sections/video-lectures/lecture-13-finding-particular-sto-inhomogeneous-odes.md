title: 'Lecture 13: Finding Particular Solutions to Inhomogeneous ODEs'
transcript: <p><span m='5000'>The task for today is to find particular solutions.</span>
  </p><p><span m='9000'>So, let me remind you where we've gotten to.</span> </p><p><span
  m='12000'>We're talking about the second-order equation with</span> <span m='17000'>constant
  coefficients, which you can think of as</span> <span m='21000'>modeling springs,
  or simple electrical circuits.</span> </p><p><span m='25000'>But, what's different
  now is that the right-hand side is an</span> <span m='29000'>input which is not
  zero. So, we are considering,</span> <span m='35000'>I'm going to use x as your
  book does, keeping to a neutral</span> <span m='41000'>letter. But, again, in the</span>
  <span m='43000'>applications, and in many of the applications</span> <span m='48000'>at
  any rate, it wants to be t. But, I make it x.</span> </p><p><span m='54000'>So,
  the independent variable is x, and the problem is,</span> <span m='59000'>remember,
  that to find a particular solution,</span> <span m='64000'>and the reason why we
  want to do that is then the general</span> <span m='70000'>solution will be of the
  form y equals that particular solution</span> <span m='77000'>plus the complementary
  solution, the general solution to the</span> <span m='83000'>reduced equation, which
  we can write this way.</span> </p><p><span m='90000'>So, all the work depends upon
  finding out what that yp is,</span> <span m='94000'>and that's what we're going
  to talk about today,</span> <span m='97000'>or rather, talk about for two weeks.</span>
  </p><p><span m='100000'>But, the point is, not all functions that you</span> <span
  m='103000'>could write on the right-hand side are equally interesting.</span> </p><p><span
  m='107000'>There's one kind, which is far more interesting,</span> <span m='110000'>but
  more important in the applications than all the</span> <span m='114000'>others.
  And, that's the one out of</span> <span m='116000'>which, in fact, as you will see
  later on this</span> <span m='120000'>week and into next week, an arbitrary function
  can be</span> <span m='123000'>built out of these simple functions.</span> </p><p><span
  m='128000'>So, the important function is on the right-hand side to be</span> <span
  m='133000'>able to solve it when it's a simple exponential.</span> </p><p><span
  m='137000'>But, if you allow me to make it a complex exponential,</span> <span m='142000'>so,
  here are the important right-hand sides where we want,</span> <span m='147000'>we
  want to be able to do it when it's of the form,</span> <span m='151000'>e to the
  ax. In general, that will be,</span> <span m='156000'>in most applications, a is
  not a growing exponential,</span> <span m='160000'>but a decaying exponential. So,
  typically,</span> <span m='163000'>a is negative. But, it doesn't have to be.</span>
  </p><p><span m='166000'>I'll put it in parentheses, though, often.</span> </p><p><span
  m='168000'>That's not any assumption that I'm going to make today.</span> </p><p><span
  m='172000'>It's just culture. But, we want to be able to do</span> <span m='176000'>it
  for sine omega x and cosine omega x.</span> </p><p><span m='179000'>In other words,</span>
  <span m='183000'>when the right-hand side is a pure oscillation,</span> <span m='186000'>that's
  another important type of input both for electrical</span> <span m='191000'>circuits,
  think alternating current, or the spring systems.</span> </p><p><span m='195000'>That's
  a pure vibration is you're imposing pure vibration</span> <span m='199000'>on the
  spring-mass-dashpot system, and you want to see how</span> <span m='204000'>it responds
  to that. Or, you could put them</span> <span m='207000'>together, and make these
  decaying oscillations.</span> </p><p><span m='212000'>So, we could also have something
  like e to the ax times</span> <span m='216000'>sine omega x, or times cosine omega
  x.</span> </p><p><span m='221000'>Now, the point is,</span> <span m='225000'>all
  of these together are really just special cases of one</span> <span m='230000'>general
  thing, exponential,</span> <span m='232000'>if you allow the exponent not to be
  a real number,</span> <span m='236000'>but to be a complex number. So, they're all
  special cases</span> <span m='242000'>of e to the, I'll write it alpha x,</span>
  <span m='247000'>well, why don't we write it (a plus i omega) x, right?</span> </p><p><span
  m='254000'>If omega is zero,</span> <span m='256000'>then I've got this case. If
  a is zero,</span> <span m='260000'>I got this case separating into its real and
  imaginary parts.</span> </p><p><span m='266000'>And, if neither is zero, I have
  this case.</span> </p><p><span m='272000'>But, I don't want to keep writing (a plus
  i omega) all the</span> <span m='276000'>time. So, I'm going to write that</span>
  <span m='278000'>simply as e to the alpha x.</span> </p><p><span m='281000'>And,
  you understand that alpha is a complex number now.</span> </p><p><span m='285000'>It
  doesn't look like a real number.</span> </p><p><span m='288000'>Okay, so the complex
  number. So, the equation we are solving</span> <span m='292000'>is which one? This
  pretty purple equation.</span> </p><p><span m='295000'>And, we are trying to find
  a particular solution of it.</span> </p><p><span m='299000'>And, the special functions
  we are going to use are these,</span> <span m='303000'>well, this one in particular,
  e to the alpha x.</span> </p><p><span m='308000'>That's going to be our input.</span>
  </p><p><span m='313000'>Now, it turns out this is amazingly easy to do because</span>
  <span m='319000'>it's an exponential because I write it in exponential form.</span>
  </p><p><span m='326000'>The idea is simply to use a rule which, in fact,</span>
  <span m='332000'>you know already, the rule of substitution.</span> </p><p><span
  m='338000'>So, I'm going to write the equation in the form,</span> <span m='343000'>so,
  there it is. It's y double prime plus A y</span> <span m='348000'>prime plus B y
  equals f of x.</span> </p><p><span m='355000'>But, I'm going to think of the left-hand
  side as the polynomial</span> <span m='362000'>operator, AD plus B. A and B are
  constants,</span> <span m='367000'>applied to y equals f of x.</span> </p><p><span
  m='370000'>That's the way I write the thing.</span> </p><p><span m='373000'>And,
  this part, I'm going to think of in the</span> <span m='376000'>form. This is p
  of D,</span> <span m='378000'>a polynomial in D. In fact, it's a simple</span> <span
  m='381000'>quadratic polynomial. But, most of what I'm going to</span> <span m='385000'>say
  today would apply equally well if we were a higher order</span> <span m='389000'>polynomial,
  a polynomial of higher degree.</span> </p><p><span m='394000'>And, just to reinforce
  the idea, I've given you one problem</span> <span m='398000'>in your problem set
  when p is a polynomial of higher degree.</span> </p><p><span m='402000'>I should
  say, the notes are written for</span> <span m='404000'>general polynomials, not
  just for quadratic ones.</span> </p><p><span m='408000'>I'm simplifying it by leaving
  it, today, I'll do what's in the</span> <span m='412000'>notes, but I'll do it in
  the quadratic case to save a little</span> <span m='416000'>time, and because that's
  the one you will be most concerned with</span> <span m='420000'>in the problems.
  All right, so p of D y equals f</span> <span m='425000'>of x. And now, there are
  just a</span> <span m='429000'>couple of basic formulas that we're going to use
  all the time.</span> </p><p><span m='435000'>The first is that if you apply p of
  D to a complex</span> <span m='439000'>exponential, or a real one, it doesn't matter,</span>
  <span m='443000'>the answer is you get just what you started with,</span> <span
  m='447000'>with D substituted by alpha. So, it's p of alpha.</span> </p><p><span
  m='452000'>In other words, put an alpha wherever you saw a</span> <span m='456000'>D
  in the polynomial. And, what is this?</span> </p><p><span m='460000'>Well, this
  is now just an ordinary complex number,</span> <span m='463000'>and multiply that
  by what you started with,</span> <span m='466000'>e to the alpha x.</span> </p><p><span
  m='468000'>So, that's a basic formula. It's called in the notes the</span> <span
  m='472000'>substitution rule because the heart of it is,</span> <span m='475000'>you
  substitute for the D, you substitute alpha.</span> </p><p><span m='480000'>Now,
  this hardly requires proof.</span> </p><p><span m='482000'>But, let's prove it just
  so you see, to reinforce things and</span> <span m='487000'>make things go a little
  more slowly to make sure you are on</span> <span m='492000'>board all the time.
  How would I prove that?</span> </p><p><span m='495000'>Well, just calculate it out,
  what in fact is (D squared plus</span> <span m='500000'>AD plus B) times e to the
  alpha x.</span> </p><p><span m='505000'>Well, it's D squared e to the alpha x by
  linearity plus AD</span> <span m='510000'>times e to the alpha x plus B times e
  to the alpha x.</span> </p><p><span m='520000'>Well, what are these? What's the
  derivative of e to</span> <span m='523000'>the alpha x? It's just alpha times e
  to the</span> <span m='526000'>alpha x. What's a second derivative?</span> </p><p><span
  m='530000'>Well, if you remember from the exam, you can do tenth</span> <span m='533000'>derivatives
  now. So, the second derivative is</span> <span m='536000'>easy. It's alpha squared
  times e to</span> <span m='538000'>the alpha x.</span> </p><p><span m='540000'>In
  other words, this law, what I'm saying</span> <span m='543000'>really is that this
  law is obviously, quote unquote,</span> <span m='546000'>"true." Okay, I'm not even
  going to put</span> <span m='550000'>it in quotes. It's obviously true for the</span>
  <span m='552000'>operator, D, and the operator D squared.</span> </p><p><span m='556000'>In
  other words, D of e to the alpha x equals</span> <span m='559000'>alpha times e
  to the alpha x.</span> </p><p><span m='562000'>D squared times e to the alpha</span>
  <span m='565000'>x equals alpha squared times e to the alpha x.</span> </p><p><span
  m='570000'>And, therefore,</span> <span m='574000'>it's true for linear combinations
  of these as well by</span> <span m='577000'>linearity. So, therefore,</span> <span
  m='579000'>also true for p of D. And, in fact,</span> <span m='582000'>so if you
  calculate it out, what is it?</span> </p><p><span m='585000'>This is alpha squared
  e to the alpha x plus alpha e to the</span> <span m='590000'>alpha x times the</span>
  <span m='594000'>coefficient plus b times e to the alpha x.</span> </p><p><span
  m='600000'>So, it's in fact exactly this. It's e to the alpha x times</span> <span
  m='604000'>(alpha squared plus A alpha plus B).</span> </p><p><span m='610000'>Now,
  how are we going to use</span> <span m='613000'>this? Well, the idea is very simple.</span>
  </p><p><span m='616000'>Remember, we're trying to solve this, I should have some</span>
  <span m='621000'>consistent notation for these equations.</span> </p><p><span m='625000'>Purple,
  I think, will be the right thing here.</span> </p><p><span m='628000'>You are solving
  purple equations.</span> </p><p><span m='633000'>The formulas which will solve them
  will be orange formulas,</span> <span m='638000'>and we will see what we need as
  we go along.</span> </p><p><span m='642000'>So, I would like to just formulate it,</span>
  <span m='645000'>this solution, the particular solution now.</span> </p><p><span
  m='649000'>I'm going to call it a theorem. It's really too simple to be a</span>
  <span m='654000'>theorem. On the other hand,</span> <span m='657000'>it's too important
  not to be a theorem.</span> </p><p><span m='662000'>So, let's call it, as I called
  it in the notes,</span> <span m='666000'>the exponential input theorem, which says
  it all.</span> </p><p><span m='671000'>Theorem says it's important. Exponential
  input means it's</span> <span m='677000'>taking f of x to be an exponential.</span>
  </p><p><span m='681000'>It's an exponential input, and the theorem tells you what</span>
  <span m='687000'>the response is. So, for that equation,</span> <span m='693000'>I'm
  not going to recopy the equation for the purple</span> <span m='700000'>equation,
  adequately indicated this way.</span> </p><p><span m='706000'>There. Now try to
  take notes.</span> </p><p><span m='711000'>For the purple equation, a solution is
  e to the alpha x.</span> </p><p><span m='719000'>Somewhere I neglected to say</span>
  <span m='725000'>that f of x, all right, so for the purple equals e to</span> <span
  m='729000'>the alpha x, how about that?</span> </p><p><span m='734000'>That equation,
  y double prime plus a y prime</span> <span m='737000'>plus b y equals e to the alpha
  x.</span> </p><p><span m='742000'>So, here's the exponential</span> <span m='745000'>input.
  The solution is e to the alpha</span> <span m='748000'>x divided by p of alpha.</span>
  </p><p><span m='754000'>Now, that's a very useful formula.</span> </p><p><span m='756000'>In
  fact, Haynes Miller, who also teaches this course,</span> <span m='760000'>in his
  notes calls of the most important theorem in the course.</span> </p><p><span m='765000'>Well,
  I don't have to totally agree with him,</span> <span m='769000'>but it's certainly
  important. It's probably the most</span> <span m='773000'>important theorem for
  these two weeks, anyway.</span> </p><p><span m='777000'>But, you will have others
  as well.</span> </p><p><span m='779000'>Okay, so that's a theorem. The theorem is
  going green.</span> </p><p><span m='783000'>You can tell what they are by their
  color code.</span> </p><p><span m='789000'>Well, in other words, what I've done
  is simply write</span> <span m='792000'>down the solution for you, write down the
  particular</span> <span m='796000'>solution. But let's verify it in general.</span>
  </p><p><span m='799000'>So, the proof would be what? Well, I have to substitute
  it</span> <span m='804000'>into the equation. So, the equation is p of D</span>
  <span m='807000'>applied to y is equal to alpha x.</span> </p><p><span m='811000'>And,
  I want to know, when I substitute that</span> <span m='814000'>expression in, is
  it the case that when I plug</span> <span m='817000'>it in, that the right-hand
  side, I calculate it out,</span> <span m='821000'>apply p of D to it. Is it the
  case that I get e to</span> <span m='826000'>the alpha x on the right?</span> </p><p><span
  m='829000'>Well, all you have to do is do it.</span> </p><p><span m='831000'>What
  is p of D applied to e to the alpha x divided by p of</span> <span m='836000'>alpha?</span>
  </p><p><span m='840000'>Well, p of D applied to e to the alpha x is p of alpha times</span>
  <span m='843000'>e to the alpha x.</span> </p><p><span m='847000'>That's the substitution
  rule. What about this guy?</span> </p><p><span m='850000'>This guy is a constant,
  so it just gets dragged along</span> <span m='853000'>because this operator is linear.
  If this applied to that is</span> <span m='857000'>this, then if I apply it to one
  half that, I get one half the</span> <span m='861000'>answer, and so on. So, the
  p of alpha</span> <span m='864000'>is a constant and just gets dragged along.</span>
  </p><p><span m='867000'>And now, they cancel each other, and the answer is,</span>
  <span m='870000'>indeed, e to the alpha x.</span> </p><p><span m='874000'>That's
  not much of a proof. I hope that to at least half</span> <span m='879000'>this class,
  you're wondering, yes, but what if Peter had not</span> <span m='885000'>caught
  the wolf? I mean, what if?</span> </p><p><span m='888000'>What if?</span> </p><p><span
  m='901000'>I'm looking stern. Okay, we will take care of it</span> <span m='904000'>in
  the simplest possible way. We will assume that p of alpha</span> <span m='910000'>is
  not zero. The case p of alpha is zero</span> <span m='913000'>is, in fact, an extremely
  important</span> <span m='917000'>case, one that makes the world go 'round, one
  that contributes</span> <span m='922000'>to all sorts of catastrophes, and they
  occur first here in</span> <span m='927000'>the solution of differential equations,
  and that's what</span> <span m='932000'>controls all the catastrophes. But, there's
  a good side to it,</span> <span m='937000'>too. It also makes a lot of good</span>
  <span m='939000'>things happen. So, there are no moral</span> <span m='941000'>judgments
  in mathematics. For the time being,</span> <span m='944000'>let's assume p of alpha
  is not zero.</span> </p><p><span m='946000'>And, that proof is okay because the
  p of alpha,</span> <span m='948000'>being in the denominator, it's okay to be in
  the</span> <span m='951000'>denominator if you're not zero. Okay, let's work in
  a simple</span> <span m='955000'>example. Well, I'm picking the most</span> <span
  m='956000'>complicated example I can think of.</span> </p><p><span m='960000'>Simple
  examples, I'll leave for your practice</span> <span m='964000'>and for the recitations,
  can start off with simple</span> <span m='968000'>examples if you are confused by
  this.</span> </p><p><span m='972000'>But, let's solve an equation, find a particular
  solution.</span> </p><p><span m='977000'>So, y double prime plus minus y prime plus
  2y is equal to 10 e</span> <span m='983000'>to the minus x sine x.</span> </p><p><span
  m='989000'>Gulp. Okay, so, the input is this</span> <span m='993000'>function, 10
  e to the minus x,</span> <span m='996000'>it's a decaying oscillation. You're seeing
  those already on</span> <span m='1000000'>the computer screen if you started your
  homework,</span> <span m='1004000'>if you've done problem one on your homework.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1007000'>It's a decaying exponential, and I want to find a particular</span>
  <span m='1012000'>solution. Well, let's find a particular</span> <span m='1015000'>and
  the general solution. Find the general solution.</span> </p><p><span m='1020000'>Well,
  the main part of the work is finding the particular</span> <span m='1025000'>solution,
  but let's quickly, the general solution,</span> <span m='1030000'>let's find first
  the complementary part of it,</span> <span m='1034000'>in other words, the solution
  to the homogeneous</span> <span m='1039000'>equation. That's D squared minus D plus</span>
  <span m='1042000'>two. No, let's not.</span> </p><p><span m='1046000'>I don't want
  to solve messy quadratics.</span> </p><p><span m='1051000'>Okay, we're going to
  find a particular solution.</span> </p><p><span m='1054000'>I thought it was going
  to come out easy, and then I realized it</span> <span m='1059000'>wasn't because
  I picked the wrong signs.</span> </p><p><span m='1063000'>Okay, so if you don't
  like, just change the problem.</span> </p><p><span m='1067000'>I can do that, but
  you cannot.</span> </p><p><span m='1069000'>Don't forget that. So, we want a particular</span>
  <span m='1073000'>solution in our equation. It is this equals that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1077000'>Now, let's complexify it to make this part of a complex</span> <span
  m='1081000'>exponential. So, the complex exponential</span> <span m='1086000'>that's
  relevant is ten times e to the (minus one plus i),</span> <span m='1092000'>you
  see that? x.</span> </p><p><span m='1095000'>What is this? This is the imaginary
  part of</span> <span m='1099000'>this complex exponential. So, this is imaginary
  part of</span> <span m='1104000'>that guy, e to the negative x times e to the i
  x,</span> <span m='1109000'>and the imaginary part of e to</span> <span m='1113000'>the
  i x.</span> </p><p><span m='1119000'>The ten, of course, just comes along for the
  ride.</span> </p><p><span m='1122000'>Okay, well, now, since this is a complex</span>
  <span m='1124000'>equation, I shouldn't call this y anymore by my notation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1128000'>I like to call it y tilde to indicate that the solution
  we</span> <span m='1132000'>get to this is not going to be the original solution
  to the</span> <span m='1136000'>original problem, but you will have to take the</span>
  <span m='1139000'>imaginary part of it to get it. So, we are looking,</span> <span
  m='1143000'>now, for the complex solution to this complexified equation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1148000'>Okay, what is it? Well, the complex particular</span> <span
  m='1151000'>solution I can write down immediately.</span> </p><p><span m='1154000'>It
  is ten, that, of course, just gets dragged</span> <span m='1158000'>along by linearity,
  times e to the (minus one plus</span> <span m='1162000'>i) times x. And, it's over
  this polynomial</span> <span m='1167000'>evaluated at this alpha. So, just write
  it down with,</span> <span m='1171000'>have faith. So, what do I get?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1173000'>The alpha is minus one plus i.</span> </p><p><span m='1176000'>I. square
  that,</span> <span m='1177000'>because I'm substituting this alpha into that polynomial.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1181000'>The reason I'm doing that is because the formula tells
  me to</span> <span m='1185000'>do it. That's going to be that</span> <span m='1187000'>solution.
  Okay, so it's minus one plus i,</span> <span m='1190000'>the quantity squared, minus
  minus one plus i plus two.</span> </p><p><span m='1194000'>All I've done is substitute</span>
  <span m='1198000'>minus one plus i for D in that polynomial,</span> <span m='1201000'>the
  quadratic polynomial. And now, all I want is the</span> <span m='1207000'>imaginary
  part of this. The imaginary part of this will</span> <span m='1212000'>be the solution
  to the original problem because this was the</span> <span m='1218000'>right hand
  side with the imaginary part of the</span> <span m='1222000'>complexified right
  hand side. Okay, now, let's make it look a</span> <span m='1228000'>little better,
  yp tilde.</span> </p><p><span m='1232000'>Clearly, what we have to do something
  nice to the</span> <span m='1234000'>denominator. So, I'll copy the numerator.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1237000'>That's e to the minus (one plus i) x</span> <span m='1240000'>and
  how about the denominator? Well, again,</span> <span m='1243000'>don't expand things
  out because it's already this long.</span> </p><p><span m='1246000'>And, what's
  the point of making it this long?</span> </p><p><span m='1248000'>You want to make
  it as long, right?</span> </p><p><span m='1250000'>Okay, then there is room here
  for one real number,</span> <span m='1253000'>and another real number times i, there's
  no more room.</span> </p><p><span m='1257000'>Okay, what's the real number? Okay,
  we're looking for the</span> <span m='1262000'>real part of this expression. So,
  just put it in and keep it</span> <span m='1267000'>mentally. So, minus one squared:</span>
  <span m='1269000'>that's one, plus i squared, that's minus one.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1273000'>One minus one is zero. I can forget about that term.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1278000'>The term gives me plus one for the real part,</span> <span m='1281000'>plus
  two. The answer is that the real</span> <span m='1284000'>part is three. How about
  the imaginary part?</span> </p><p><span m='1288000'>Well, from here, there's negative
  2i,</span> <span m='1291000'>negative 2i. I'm expanding that out by the</span> <span
  m='1298000'>binomial theorem, or whatever you like to call</span> <span m='1304000'>that,
  minus 2i minus i makes minus 3i.</span> </p><p><span m='1311000'>Is that right?
  Minus 2i, minus i,</span> <span m='1316000'>minus 3i. So, it is ten thirds,</span>
  <span m='1320000'>and now in the denominator I have one minus i.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1328000'>I'll put that in the numerator, make it one plus i,</span> <span m='1332000'>but
  I have to divide by the product of one minus i and its</span> <span m='1337000'>complex
  conjugate. In other words,</span> <span m='1340000'>I'm multiplying both top and
  bottom by one plus i.</span> </p><p><span m='1344000'>And so, that makes here one
  squared plus one squared is two.</span> </p><p><span m='1350000'>And now, what's
  left is e to the negative x times cosine x</span> <span m='1355000'>plus i sine
  x.</span> </p><p><span m='1360000'>Now, of that, what we want is just the</span>
  <span m='1363000'>imaginary part. Well, let's see.</span> </p><p><span m='1366000'>Two
  goes into ten makes five, so that's five thirds.</span> </p><p><span m='1372000'>So,
  we're practically at our solution.</span> </p><p><span m='1375000'>The solution,
  then, finally,</span> <span m='1378000'>is going to be yp is the imaginary part
  of yp tilde.</span> </p><p><span m='1385000'>And, what's that? Well, what's the
  coefficient</span> <span m='1388000'>out front, first of all? It's five thirds,</span>
  <span m='1392000'>so let's pull out to five thirds before we forget it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1396000'>And, we'll pull out the e to the negative x before we forget</span>
  <span m='1401000'>that. And then, the rest is simply a</span> <span m='1404000'>question
  of seeing what's left. Well, it's one.</span> </p><p><span m='1408000'>I want the
  imaginary part. So, the imaginary part is going</span> <span m='1413000'>to be one
  times cosine x, and then the other</span> <span m='1417000'>imaginary part comes
  from these two pieces, which is one times</span> <span m='1422000'>sine x. And,
  that should be the</span> <span m='1427000'>particular solution. Notice that most
  of the work is</span> <span m='1432000'>not getting this thing. It's turning it
  into something</span> <span m='1436000'>human that you can take the real and imaginary
  parts of.</span> </p><p><span m='1442000'>If we don't like this form, you can put
  it in the other</span> <span m='1447000'>form, which many engineers would do almost
  automatically,</span> <span m='1452000'>make it five thirds, e to the negative x,</span>
  <span m='1456000'>and what will that be? Well, you can use the general</span> <span
  m='1461000'>formula if you want. Remember, cosine,</span> <span m='1464000'>the
  two coefficients are one and one, so it's one and one.</span> </p><p><span m='1470000'>So,
  this is the square root of two.</span> </p><p><span m='1473000'>So, it is times,
  this part makes the square root</span> <span m='1477000'>of two times cosine of
  x minus pi over the angle.</span> </p><p><span m='1484000'>This is a phi. So, that's
  pi over four,</span> <span m='1487000'>minus pi over four.</span> </p><p><span m='1498000'>Okay,
  all right, now let's address the case</span> <span m='1502000'>which is going to
  occupy a lot of the rest of today,</span> <span m='1507000'>and in a certain sense,
  all of next time.</span> </p><p><span m='1511000'>What happens when p of alpha is
  zero?</span> </p><p><span m='1516000'>Well, in order to be able to handle this decently,</span>
  <span m='1521000'>it's necessary to have one more formula, which is very slightly</span>
  <span m='1528000'>more complicated than the substitution rule.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1534000'>But, it's the same kind of rule.</span> </p><p><span m='1536000'>I'm
  going to call this, or it is called the</span> <span m='1538000'>exponential. So,
  I'm going to first prove a</span> <span m='1541000'>formula, which is the analog
  of that, and then I will prove a</span> <span m='1545000'>green formula, which is
  what to do here if p</span> <span m='1548000'>of alpha turns out to be zero.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1551000'>But, in order to be able to prove that, we're going to
  be</span> <span m='1554000'>the analog of the orange formula.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1556000'>And, the analogue of the orange formula, that tells you how to</span>
  <span m='1560000'>apply p of D to a simple exponential.</span> </p><p><span m='1565000'>I
  need a formula which applies p of D to that simple</span> <span m='1571000'>exponential
  times another function.</span> </p><p><span m='1574000'>Now, I found I got into
  trouble by continuing to call that</span> <span m='1580000'>alpha. So, I'm now going
  to change the</span> <span m='1584000'>name of alpha to change alpha's name to a.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1590000'>But, it's still complex. I don't mean it's guaranteed to</span>
  <span m='1594000'>be complex. I mean it's allowed to be</span> <span m='1597000'>complex.
  So, a is now allowed to be a</span> <span m='1600000'>complex number. I'm thinking
  of it,</span> <span m='1603000'>in general, as a complex number, okay?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1606000'>I hope this doesn't upset you too much, but you know,</span> <span m='1611000'>you
  change x to t's, and y's to x's.</span> </p><p><span m='1614000'>This is no worse.
  All right, what we going to do?</span> </p><p><span m='1618000'>Well, I'm going
  to use this exponential shift rule,</span> <span m='1622000'>I'll call it, exponential
  shift rule or</span> <span m='1626000'>formula or law. That's the substitution rule</span>
  <span m='1631000'>for me. So, this is going to be</span> <span m='1633000'>exponential
  shift law. And, to apply,</span> <span m='1637000'>it tells you how to apply the
  polynomial to not D,</span> <span m='1641000'>not just the exponential, but the
  exponential times some</span> <span m='1645000'>function of x. What's that?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1648000'>And now, the rule is very simple.</span> </p><p><span m='1652000'>See,
  you can understand the difficulty.</span> </p><p><span m='1654000'>If you try to
  start differentiating,</span> <span m='1657000'>you're going to have to calculate
  second derivatives of</span> <span m='1660000'>the stuff, and God forbid, higher
  order equations.</span> </p><p><span m='1664000'>You would have to calculate fourth
  derivatives,</span> <span m='1667000'>fifth derivatives. You barely even want to</span>
  <span m='1670000'>calculate the first derivative. That's okay.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1673000'>But, second derivative, do I have to?</span> </p><p><span m='1675000'>No,
  not if you know the exponential shift rule,</span> <span m='1678000'>which says
  you can get rid of the e to the ax,</span> <span m='1681000'>make it pass to the
  left of the operator where it's not in any</span> <span m='1686000'>position to
  do any harm any longer, or upset the</span> <span m='1689000'>differentiation. And,
  all you have to do is,</span> <span m='1694000'>when it passes over that operator,
  it changes D to D plus</span> <span m='1698000'>a. So, the answer is,</span> <span
  m='1701000'>e to the ax. There, it's passed over.</span> </p><p><span m='1704000'>But,
  when it did so, it changed D to D plus a.</span> </p><p><span m='1708000'>And, what
  about the u? Well, the u just stayed there.</span> </p><p><span m='1712000'>Nothing
  happened to it. Okay, there's our orange</span> <span m='1716000'>formula. I guess
  we better put the thing</span> <span m='1720000'>around the whole business. Should
  I prove that,</span> <span m='1723000'>or the proof is quite easy. So, let's do
  it just again to</span> <span m='1728000'>give you a chance to try to see, now,
  if somebody gives you a</span> <span m='1733000'>formula like that, you first stare
  at it.</span> </p><p><span m='1736000'>You might try a couple of special cases,</span>
  <span m='1739000'>try it on a function and see if it works, but already,</span>
  <span m='1743000'>you probably don't want to do that.</span> </p><p><span m='1748000'>I
  mean, even if you took a function like x here,</span> <span m='1750000'>you'd have
  to do a certain amount of differentiating,</span> <span m='1754000'>and some quadratic
  thing here. You'd calculate and calculate</span> <span m='1757000'>away for a little
  while, and then if you did it</span> <span m='1760000'>correctly, the two would
  in fact turn out to be equal.</span> </p><p><span m='1763000'>But, you would not
  necessarily feel any the wiser.</span> </p><p><span m='1766000'>A better procedure
  in trying to understand something like this</span> <span m='1770000'>is say, well,
  let's keep the u general.</span> </p><p><span m='1774000'>Suppose we make D simple.
  For example,</span> <span m='1776000'>well, if D is a constant, of course there's
  nothing to</span> <span m='1779000'>happen because if this is just a constant, both
  sides of these</span> <span m='1783000'>are the same. This doesn't make any sense
  if</span> <span m='1786000'>p doesn't really have a D in it. Well, what's the simplest</span>
  <span m='1789000'>polynomial which would have a D in it?</span> </p><p><span m='1792000'>Well,
  D itself. So, let's take a special case.</span> </p><p><span m='1794000'>p of D
  equals D, and check the formula in that</span> <span m='1798000'>case; see if it
  works. So, the formula is asking us,</span> <span m='1803000'>what is D, that's
  the p of D, of e to the ax times u?</span> </p><p><span m='1808000'>I'm not going
  to put in the</span> <span m='1812000'>variable here because it's just a waste of
  chalk.</span> </p><p><span m='1816000'>Well, what is that? I know how to calculate
  that.</span> </p><p><span m='1821000'>I'll use the product rule. So, it's the derivative.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1825000'>I'll tell you what; let's do the other order first.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1830000'>So, it's e to the ax times the derivative of u plus the</span>
  <span m='1835000'>derivative of e to the ax, which is a times e to the ax</span>
  <span m='1840000'>times u.</span> </p><p><span m='1845000'>Do you follow that? This
  is the product rule.</span> </p><p><span m='1848000'>It's e to the ax times the
  derivative of u plus the</span> <span m='1851000'>derivative of e to the ax, which
  is this thing times u,</span> <span m='1855000'>the other factor.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1858000'>Now, is that right? I want to make it look like</span> <span m='1861000'>that.
  Well, to make it look like that</span> <span m='1864000'>I should first factor e
  to the ax out.</span> </p><p><span m='1867000'>And now, what's left? Well, if I
  factor e to the ax</span> <span m='1871000'>out, what's left is Du plus au, which
  is exactly (D plus a)</span> <span m='1875000'>operating on u, D u plus a u.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1879000'>Well, hey, that's just what the formula said it should
  be.</span> </p><p><span m='1883000'>If you make e to the x pass over D, it changes
  D to</span> <span m='1887000'>D plus a. Okay, now here's the main thing</span> <span
  m='1892000'>I want to show you. All right, now,</span> <span m='1894000'>well let's
  try, if this is true,</span> <span m='1897000'>also works out for D squared, then
  the formula is</span> <span m='1901000'>clearly true by linearity because an arbitrary
  p of D</span> <span m='1905000'>is just a linear combination with constant</span>
  <span m='1909000'>coefficients of D, D squared, and that constant</span> <span m='1913000'>thing,
  which we agreed there was nothing to prove about.</span> </p><p><span m='1917000'>Now,
  hack, you're a hack if you take D squared and start</span> <span m='1921000'>calculating
  the second derivative of this.</span> </p><p><span m='1926000'>Okay, it's question
  about hacks.</span> </p><p><span m='1928000'>I mean, it's just, you haven't learned
  the right</span> <span m='1932000'>thing to do. Okay, that will work,</span> <span
  m='1934000'>but it's not what you want to do.</span> </p><p><span m='1937000'>Instead,
  you bootstrap your way up.</span> </p><p><span m='1940000'>I have already a formula
  telling me how to handle this.</span> </p><p><span m='1944000'>And, you can be anything.
  Look at this not as D squared</span> <span m='1948000'>all by itself. Calculate,
  instead,</span> <span m='1952000'>D squared e to the ax times u.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1956000'>Think of that as D, the derivative of the</span> <span m='1959000'>derivative
  of e to the a x u.</span> </p><p><span m='1962000'>In other words, we will do it
  one step at a</span> <span m='1965000'>time. But you see now immediately the</span>
  <span m='1968000'>advantage of this. What's D of e to the a x u?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1971000'>Well, I just calculated that.</span> </p><p><span m='1975000'>Now, don't
  go back to the beginning.</span> </p><p><span m='1977000'>Don't go back to here.
  Use the formula.</span> </p><p><span m='1982000'>After all, you worked to calculate
  it,</span> <span m='1984000'>or I did. So, it's D of,</span> <span m='1986000'>and
  what's this inside? It's e to the ax times (D plus</span> <span m='1990000'>a) times
  u. Well, that looks like a mess,</span> <span m='1995000'>but it isn't because I'm
  taking D of e to the ax times</span> <span m='1999000'>something. And I already
  know how to take</span> <span m='2003000'>D of e to the ax times something.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2005000'>It doesn't matter what that something is.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2010000'>Here, the something was u. Here, the something is D plus</span> <span
  m='2015000'>(a times u) operating on u. But, the principle is the same,</span> <span
  m='2020000'>and the answer is what? Well, to take D of e to the ax</span> <span
  m='2026000'>times something, you pass the e to the ax over</span> <span m='2030000'>the
  D. That changes D to D plus a.</span> </p><p><span m='2033000'>And, you apply that
  to the</span> <span m='2037000'>other guy, which is (D plus a) applied to u.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2043000'>What's the answer? e to the a x times (D plus a)</span>
  <span m='2046000'>squared u.</span> </p><p><span m='2049000'>It's just what you
  would have gotten if you had taken e to the</span> <span m='2054000'>e to the x,
  pass it over, and then changed D to D plus a.</span> </p><p><span m='2058000'>Now,
  another advantage to doing</span> <span m='2062000'>it this way is you can see that
  this argument is going to</span> <span m='2066000'>generalize to D cubed. In other
  words,</span> <span m='2071000'>you would continue on in the same way by the process
  of</span> <span m='2076000'>mathematical, one word, mathematical,</span> <span m='2079000'>begins
  with an I, induction.</span> </p><p><span m='2081000'>By induction, you would prove
  the same</span> <span m='2084000'>formula for the nth derivative. If you don't know
  what</span> <span m='2089000'>mathematical induction is, shame on you.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2093000'>But it's okay. A lot of you will be able to go</span> <span m='2097000'>through
  life without ever having to learn what it is.</span> </p><p><span m='2103000'>And,
  the rest of you will be computer scientists.</span> </p><p><span m='2108000'>Okay,
  so that's the idea of this rule.</span> </p><p><span m='2113000'>Now, we can use
  it to calculate something.</span> </p><p><span m='2118000'>Let's see, I'm going
  to need green for this,</span> <span m='2123000'>I guess, for our better formula.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2127000'>The formula, now, that tells you what to do</span> <span
  m='2132000'>if p of alpha is zero.</span> </p><p><span m='2139000'>So, we're trying
  to solve the equation, D squared plus A D,</span> <span m='2145000'>we are trying
  to find a</span> <span m='2149000'>particular solution, e to the ax,</span> <span
  m='2154000'>let's say. Remember, a is complex.</span> </p><p><span m='2158000'>a
  could be complex. It doesn't have to be real.</span> </p><p><span m='2165000'>But,
  the problem is that p of alpha is zero.</span> </p><p><span m='2169000'>How do I
  get a particular solution?</span> </p><p><span m='2172000'>Well, I will write it
  down for you.</span> </p><p><span m='2174000'>So, this is part of that exponential
  input theorem.</span> </p><p><span m='2178000'>I think that's the way it is in the
  notes.</span> </p><p><span m='2181000'>I gave all the cases together, but I thought
  pedagogically</span> <span m='2185000'>it's probably a little better to do the simplest
  case first,</span> <span m='2190000'>and then build up on the complexity.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2194000'>So, what's yp? The answer is yp is e to the a,</span> <span
  m='2198000'>except now you have to multiply</span> <span m='2203000'>it by x out
  front. Where have you done something</span> <span m='2208000'>like that before?
  Yes, don't tell me.</span> </p><p><span m='2211000'>I know you know. But, what should
  go in the</span> <span m='2216000'>denominator? Clearly not p of alpha.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2219000'>What goes in the denominator is</span> <span m='2224000'>the derivative.
  Okay, but what if p prime of</span> <span m='2229000'>alpha is zero? Couldn't that
  happen?</span> </p><p><span m='2234000'>Yes, it could happen. So, we better make
  cases.</span> </p><p><span m='2238000'>This case is, the case where this is okay</span>
  <span m='2242000'>corresponds to the case where we're going to assume that alpha</span>
  <span m='2247000'>is a simple root, is a simple root of the</span> <span m='2251000'>polynomial,
  p. I don't know what to call the</span> <span m='2255000'>variable, p of D is okay.
  A simple zero,</span> <span m='2260000'>in other words, it's not double.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2263000'>Well, suppose is double. One of the consequences you</span>
  <span m='2268000'>will see just in a second, if it's a simple zero,</span> <span
  m='2272000'>that means this derivative is not going to be zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2277000'>That's automatic. Yeah, well, suppose it's not as</span> <span m='2281000'>simple.
  Well, suppose is a double root.</span> </p><p><span m='2285000'>How did a-- How
  did that get changed to, argh!</span> </p><p><span m='2291000'>[LAUGHTER] That's
  not an alpha. Oh, well, yes it is,</span> <span m='2296000'>obviously. Change!</span>
  </p><p><span m='2298000'>All of you, I want you to change.</span> </p><p><span m='2301000'>They
  should have something like in a search key where</span> <span m='2307000'>occurrences
  of alpha have been changed to a with a stroke of a,</span> <span m='2314000'>just
  your thumb. They don't have that for the</span> <span m='2319000'>blackboard, unfortunately.
  Well, too bad,</span> <span m='2322000'>for the future. Correctable blackboards.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2326000'>Well, what if a is double root? It can't be more than a
  double</span> <span m='2331000'>root because you've only got a quadratic polynomial.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2335000'>Quadratic polynomials only have two roots.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2340000'>So, the worst that can happen is that both of them are a.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2344000'>All right, in that case the formula should be yp is equal</span> <span
  m='2349000'>to, you are now going to need x squared up there times e</span> <span
  m='2354000'>to the ax, and in the denominator what you</span> <span m='2358000'>are
  going to need is the second derivative of,</span> <span m='2362000'>evaluated at
  a. Now, you can guess the way this</span> <span m='2365000'>going to go on. For
  higher degree things,</span> <span m='2369000'>if you've got a triple root, you
  will need here x cubed,</span> <span m='2377000'>except you're going to need a factorial
  there,</span> <span m='2381000'>too. So, don't worry about it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2385000'>It's in the notes, but I'm not going to give you</span> <span m='2389000'>that
  for higher roots. I don't even know if I will</span> <span m='2393000'>give it to
  you for double root. Yes, I already did,</span> <span m='2397000'>so it's too late.
  It's too late.</span> </p><p><span m='2401000'>Okay, so we will make this two formulas
  according to whether a</span> <span m='2406000'>is a single or a double root. Okay,
  let's prove one of these,</span> <span m='2411000'>and all of that will be good
  enough for my conscience.</span> </p><p><span m='2416000'>Let's prove the first
  one. Mostly, it's an exercise in</span> <span m='2421000'>using the first exponential
  shift rule.</span> </p><p><span m='2424000'>Okay, this will be a first example actually
  seeing a work</span> <span m='2429000'>in practice as opposed to proving it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2434000'>Okay, so what does that thing look like?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2437000'>So, what does the polynomial look like, which has a as a</span> <span
  m='2442000'>simple root? So, we're going to try to prove</span> <span m='2446000'>the
  simple root case. So, I'm just going to calculate</span> <span m='2450000'>what
  those guys actually look like.</span> </p><p><span m='2453000'>What does p of D
  look like if a is a simple root?</span> </p><p><span m='2460000'>Well, if it's a
  simple root, that means it has a factor.</span> </p><p><span m='2464000'>When it
  factors, it factors into the product of</span> <span m='2468000'>(D minus a) times
  something which isn't, D minus some other</span> <span m='2473000'>root. And, the
  point is that b is not</span> <span m='2476000'>equal to A. The roots are really
  distinct.</span> </p><p><span m='2480000'>Okay, what's, then, p prime,</span> <span
  m='2483000'>I'm going to have to calculate p prime of a.</span> </p><p><span m='2487000'>What
  is that? Well, let's calculate p prime</span> <span m='2492000'>of D first. It is,
  well,</span> <span m='2494000'>by the ordinary product rule, it's the derivative
  of this</span> <span m='2498000'>times, which is one times (D minus a) plus,</span>
  <span m='2501000'>that's one thing plus the same thing on the other side,</span>
  <span m='2505000'>the derivative of this, which is one times (D minus b).</span>
  </p><p><span m='2509000'>So, that's p prime. And therefore,</span> <span m='2511000'>what's
  p prime of a? It's nothing but,</span> <span m='2515000'>this part is zero, and
  that's a minus b.</span> </p><p><span m='2519000'>Of course, this is not zero because
  it's a simple root.</span> </p><p><span m='2522000'>And, that's the proof for you
  if you want, that if the root is</span> <span m='2526000'>simple, that p prime of
  a is guaranteed not to</span> <span m='2530000'>be zero. And, you can see,</span>
  <span m='2532000'>it's going to be zero exactly when b equals a,</span> <span m='2535000'>and
  that root occurs twice. But, I'm assuming that didn't</span> <span m='2539000'>happen.
  Okay, then all the rest we have</span> <span m='2542000'>to do is calculate, do
  the calculation.</span> </p><p><span m='2544000'>So, what I want to prove now is
  that with this p of D,</span> <span m='2548000'>what I'm trying to calculate that
  p of D times that guy,</span> <span m='2552000'>x e to the a x, except I'm going
  to</span> <span m='2556000'>write it as e to the a x times x, guess why,</span>
  <span m='2559000'>divided by p prime of a.</span> </p><p><span m='2564000'>This
  is my proposed particular solution.</span> </p><p><span m='2567000'>So, what I have
  to do is calculate it,</span> <span m='2570000'>and see that it turns out to be,
  what do I hope it turns out</span> <span m='2574000'>to be? What the right hand
  side of the</span> <span m='2577000'>equation, the input? The input is e to the
  ax.</span> </p><p><span m='2581000'>If this is true,</span> <span m='2583000'>then
  yp, a particular solution, indeed, nothing will be a</span> <span m='2587000'>particular
  solution. Of course, there could be</span> <span m='2591000'>others, but in this
  game, I only have to find one</span> <span m='2594000'>particular solution, and
  that certainly by far is</span> <span m='2598000'>the simple as one you could possibly
  find.</span> </p><p><span m='2601000'>So, I have to calculate this. And now, you
  see why I did the</span> <span m='2605000'>exponential shift rule because this is
  begging to be</span> <span m='2609000'>differentiated by something simpler than
  hack.</span> </p><p><span m='2614000'>Okay, you can also see why I violated the
  natural order of</span> <span m='2618000'>things and put the e to the ax on the
  left in order</span> <span m='2623000'>that it pass over more easily. So, the answer
  on the left-hand</span> <span m='2628000'>side is e to the ax times p of (D plus
  a).</span> </p><p><span m='2631000'>Now, what is (p of D) plus a? Write it in this
  form.</span> </p><p><span m='2636000'>It's going to be a minus b.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2640000'>So, p of (D plus a) is, change D to D plus a.</span> </p><p><span m='2644000'>So,
  the first factor is going</span> <span m='2647000'>to be D plus a minus b.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2650000'>And, what's the second factor? Change D to D plus a.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2655000'>It turns into D.</span> </p><p><span m='2656000'>All this
  is the result of taking that p of D,</span> <span m='2661000'>and changing D to
  D plus a. And now, this is to be applied</span> <span m='2665000'>to what? Well,
  e to the a x</span> <span m='2668000'>is already passed over. So, what's left is
  x.</span> </p><p><span m='2673000'>And, that's to be divided by the constant,</span>
  <span m='2676000'>p prime of a. Now, what does this all come</span> <span m='2681000'>out
  to be? e to the ax,</span> <span m='2684000'>what's D applied to x? One, right?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2688000'>And now, what's this thing applied to the constant one?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2693000'>Well, the D kills it, so it has no effect.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2697000'>It makes it zero. The rest just multiplies it by</span> <span m='2702000'>a
  minus b. So, the answer to the top is (a</span> <span m='2707000'>minus b) times
  one. And, the answer to the bottom</span> <span m='2712000'>is p prime of a, which
  I showed you by just</span> <span m='2717000'>explicit calculation is a minus b.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2721000'>And so the answer is, e to the a x comes</span> <span m='2725000'>out
  right. Now, the other one,</span> <span m='2729000'>the other formula comes out
  the same way.</span> </p><p><span m='2731000'>I'll leave that as an exercise. Also,
  I don't dare do it</span> <span m='2734000'>because it's much too close to the problem
  I asked you to do</span> <span m='2738000'>for homework. So, let's by way of conclusion,</span>
  <span m='2741000'>I'll do one more simple example, okay?</span> </p><p><span m='2743000'>And
  then, you can feel you understand something.</span> </p><p><span m='2746000'>I'm
  sort of bothered that I haven't done any examples of</span> <span m='2749000'>this
  more complicated case. So, I'll pick an easy version</span> <span m='2753000'>instead
  of the one that you have in your notes,</span> <span m='2756000'>which is the one
  you have for homework, which is even easier.</span> </p><p><span m='2761000'>So,
  this one's epsilon less easy.</span> </p><p><span m='2764000'>Y double prime minus
  3 y prime plus 2 y equals e to the x.</span> </p><p><span m='2770000'>Okay, notice
  that one is a</span> <span m='2774000'>simple root. The one I'm talking about is</span>
  <span m='2778000'>the a here, which is one. One is a simple root of the</span> <span
  m='2783000'>polynomial D squared minus 3D plus two,</span> <span m='2788000'>isn't
  it? It's a zero.</span> </p><p><span m='2792000'>Put D equal one and you get one
  minus three plus</span> <span m='2795000'>two equals zero. It's a simple root because</span>
  <span m='2798000'>anybody can see that one is not a double root because you know</span>
  <span m='2801000'>from critical damping, if one were a double root,</span> <span
  m='2804000'>you know just what the polynomial would look like,</span> <span m='2807000'>and
  it wouldn't look like that at all.</span> </p><p><span m='2809000'>It would not
  look like D squared minus 3D plus two.</span> </p><p><span m='2812000'>It would
  look differently.</span> </p><p><span m='2814000'>Therefore, that proves that one
  is a simple root.</span> </p><p><span m='2817000'>Okay, what's the particular solution,
  therefore?</span> </p><p><span m='2821000'>The particular solution is x times e
  to the x divided by the</span> <span m='2826000'>derivative, the derivative evaluated
  at the point,</span> <span m='2831000'>so, what's p prime of D? It is 2D minus three.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2835000'>If I evaluate it at the point, one, it is negative one.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2840000'>So, if this is to be divided by negative one,</span> <span
  m='2845000'>in other words, it's minus x e to the X.</span> </p><p><span m='2850000'>And,
  if you don't believe it, you could plug it in and check</span> <span m='2855000'>it
  out. Okay, I'm letting you out one</span> <span m='2859000'>minute early. Remember
  that.</span> </p><p><span m='2861000'>I'm trying to pay off the accumulated debt.</span>
