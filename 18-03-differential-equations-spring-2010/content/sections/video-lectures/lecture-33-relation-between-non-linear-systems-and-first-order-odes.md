title: 'Lecture 33: Relation Between Non-linear Systems and First-order ODEs'
transcript: "<p><span m='0'>Today's lecture is going to be basically devoted to working\
  \ out</span> <span m='5000'>a single example of a nonlinear system, but it is a\
  \ very good</span> <span m='10000'>example because it illustrates three things which\
  \ you really</span> <span m='15000'>have to know about nonlinear systems.</span>\
  \ <span m='18000'>I have indicated them by three cryptic words on the board,</span>\
  \ <span m='23000'>but you will see at different points in the lecture what they</span>\
  \ <span m='28000'>refer to. Each of these represents</span> <span m='31000'>something\
  \ you need to know about nonlinear systems to be able to</span> <span m='36000'>effectively\
  \ analyze them. In addition,</span> <span m='39000'>I am not allowed to collect\
  \ any more work, according to the</span> <span m='43000'>faculty rules, after today.</span>\
  \ <span m='45000'>And, of course, I won't.</span> <span m='47000'>But, nonetheless,\
  \ the final will contain material</span> <span m='51000'>from the reading assignment\
  \ G7, and I will be touching on all</span> <span m='55000'>of these today, and 7.4,\
  \ just a couple of pages</span> <span m='59000'>of that. You will see its connection.</span>\
  \ <span m='63000'>It discusses the same example we are going to do today.</span>\
  \ <span m='67000'>And then I suggest those three exercises to try to solidify</span>\
  \ <span m='71000'>what the lecture is about.</span> <span m='81000'>Instead of introducing\
  \ the nonlinear system right away that</span> <span m='84000'>we are going to talk\
  \ about, I would like to first explain,</span> <span m='88000'>so that it won't\
  \ interrupt the presentation later,</span> <span m='91000'>what I mean by a conversion\
  \ to a first-order equation.</span> <span m='100000'>For that why don't we look\
  \ at --</span> <span m='109000'>Maybe I can do it here. Our system looks like this,</span>\
  \ <span m='112000'>dx over dt. For once, I am not writing x</span> <span m='115000'>prime\
  \ because I want to explicitly indicate what the</span> <span m='119000'>independent\
  \ variable is. It is a nonlinear autonomous</span> <span m='124000'>system, so there\
  \ is no t on the right-hand side.</span> <span m='127000'>But this is not a simple\
  \ linear function, ax plus by.</span> <span m='131000'>It is more complicated,</span>\
  \ <span m='133000'>like you had in the predator-prey robin-earthworm</span> <span\
  \ m='137000'>problem that you worked on last night.</span> <span m='140000'>And\
  \ the other equation will be g of (x, y).</span> <span m='143000'>This is the system,\
  \ and explicitly it is nonlinear</span> <span m='146000'>in general and autonomous,\
  \ as I have indicated on the</span> <span m='150000'>right-hand side. Now, remember\
  \ that the</span> <span m='155000'>geometric picture of this was as a velocity field.</span>\
  \ <span m='160000'>You made a velocity field out of the vectors whose components</span>\
  \ <span m='166000'>were f and g, so that is (f)i plus (g)j,</span> <span m='170000'>but\
  \ what it looked like was a</span> <span m='175000'>plane filled up with a lot of\
  \ vectors pointing different ways</span> <span m='181000'>according to the velocity\
  \ at the point was.</span> <span m='187000'>And side-by-side with that went the\
  \ solutions.</span> <span m='191000'>A typical solution was x equals x of t,</span>\
  \ <span m='195000'>y equals y of t represented as a column vector.</span> <span\
  \ m='200000'>And that is a parametric equation.</span> <span m='203000'>And the\
  \ geometric picture of that was given by its</span> <span m='208000'>trajectory.\
  \ When you plotted it,</span> <span m='211000'>it was a trajectory. It had not only\
  \ the right</span> <span m='215000'>direction at each point, in other words,</span>\
  \ <span m='218000'>but it also had to have the right velocity at each point.</span>\
  \ <span m='223000'>In other words, sometimes the point was moving</span> <span m='226000'>rapidly\
  \ and sometimes it was moving more slowly along that</span> <span m='231000'>path.\
  \ And the way it moved was an</span> <span m='234000'>important part of the solution.\
  \ Now, what I plan to do is --</span> <span m='240000'>The conversation that I am\
  \ talking about takes place by</span> <span m='245000'>eliminating t.</span> <span\
  \ m='254000'>Now, why would one want to do that?</span> <span m='256000'>t, after\
  \ all, is an essential part of the</span> <span m='258000'>solution. It is an essential\
  \ part of this</span> <span m='261000'>picture because without t you would not know\
  \ how long the</span> <span m='265000'>arrows were supposed to be. You would still\
  \ know their</span> <span m='268000'>direction. And, of course,</span> <span m='271000'>it\
  \ occurs in here. Now, let's take the first step</span> <span m='274000'>and eliminate\
  \ t from the system itself.</span> <span m='277000'>As you see, that is very easy\
  \ to do because the right-hand</span> <span m='281000'>side has no t in it anyway\
  \ and the left-hand side has the t</span> <span m='285000'>only as the denominators\
  \ of the differential quotients.</span> <span m='289000'>The obvious way to eliminate\
  \ t is just to divide one equation</span> <span m='294000'>by the other. And since\
  \ usually we think of</span> <span m='297000'>not dx by dy, but dy by dx,</span>\
  \ <span m='300000'>I will vow -- What is dy over dx?</span> <span m='304000'>Well,\
  \ if I divide this equation by that equation,</span> <span m='308000'>dy by dt divided\
  \ by dx by dt,</span> <span m='313000'>according to the chain rule, or according\
  \ to commonsense,</span> <span m='317000'>you cancel the dt's and you get dy over\
  \ dx.</span> <span m='322000'>And, on the right-hand side, you get g of (x,</span>\
  \ <span m='326000'>y) divided by f of (x, y).</span> <span m='328000'>But what is\
  \ that? That is the equation of the</span> <span m='333000'>first day of the term.\
  \ By taking that single step,</span> <span m='338000'>I convert this nonlinear system,\
  \ which we virtually never</span> <span m='344000'>find explicit solutions to, into\
  \ an ordinary first order</span> <span m='350000'>equation which, in fact, you also\
  \ don't usually</span> <span m='354000'>find explicit solutions to, except with\
  \ our narrow blinders</span> <span m='360000'>on. We only get problems at the</span>\
  \ <span m='364000'>beginning of 18.03 where there will be an explicit solution to</span>\
  \ <span m='369000'>this. I have converted the nonlinear</span> <span m='372000'>system\
  \ to a single first order equation to which I can apply</span> <span m='378000'>the\
  \ usual first order methods that include hope that I will be</span> <span m='383000'>able\
  \ to solve it. Now, what do I lose?</span> <span m='386000'>Well, what happens to\
  \ this picture?</span> <span m='391000'>If you don't have the t in it anymore then\
  \ you don't have</span> <span m='395000'>velocity, you don't have arrows with a\
  \ length to them because</span> <span m='399000'>the length gives you how fast the\
  \ point is going.</span> <span m='403000'>Without t I don't know at any point how\
  \ fast it is supposed to</span> <span m='407000'>be going. All I know at any point\
  \ (x,</span> <span m='410000'>y) is no longer dx over dt and dy over dt.</span>\
  \ <span m='414000'>All I know is dy over dx.</span> <span m='416000'>In other words,</span>\
  \ <span m='418000'>the corresponding picture, if I eliminate t from this</span>\
  \ <span m='422000'>picture all that is left is the directions of each of these</span>\
  \ <span m='426000'>arrows. What disappears is their</span> <span m='430000'>length.\
  \ And, in fact,</span> <span m='432000'>since dy over dx is purely a slope,</span>\
  \ <span m='435000'>I cannot even tell whether the point is traveling this way or</span>\
  \ <span m='439000'>that way. It doesn't make any sense to</span> <span m='442000'>have\
  \ the point traveling anymore since there is no time in which</span> <span m='447000'>it\
  \ can do its traveling. So that picture gets changed to</span> <span m='452000'>the\
  \ direction field. The corresponding picture now,</span> <span m='457000'>all you\
  \ do is take each of these arrows,</span> <span m='460000'>you snip it off to a\
  \ standard length, being careful to snip</span> <span m='465000'>off the little\
  \ pointy end, and it becomes nothing but a</span> <span m='470000'>line element.\
  \ And all it has is a slope.</span> <span m='473000'>What corresponds to the velocity\
  \ field here is now just</span> <span m='478000'>our slope field or our direction\
  \ field.</span> <span m='483000'>All we know is the slope at each point.</span>\
  \ <span m='485000'>How about the solution? Well, if I have eliminated</span> <span\
  \ m='489000'>time, the solution is no longer a pair of parametric equations.</span>\
  \ <span m='493000'>It is just an equation involving x and y.</span> <span m='496000'>I\
  \ can hope that the solution will be explicit,</span> <span m='499000'>y equals\
  \ y of x, but you already know from the</span> <span m='504000'>first days of the\
  \ term that sometimes it isn't.</span> <span m='507000'>Let's call that explicit\
  \ solution.</span> <span m='511000'>Often you have to settle for it.</span> <span\
  \ m='513000'>And sometimes it is not a pain. It is something that is even</span>\
  \ <span m='518000'>better. Settle for a solution which</span> <span m='521000'>looks\
  \ like this which is y defined implicitly as a function</span> <span m='526000'>of\
  \ x. And what does the picture of</span> <span m='528000'>that look like? Well,\
  \ the picture of this is</span> <span m='532000'>now simply an integral curve. It\
  \ is not a trajectory anymore.</span> <span m='537000'>It is what we called an integral\
  \ curve.</span> <span m='542000'>I am reminding you of the very first day of the\
  \ term,</span> <span m='545000'>or maybe the second day. And all it has at each\
  \ point</span> <span m='548000'>the right slope because that is all the field is\
  \ telling me now.</span> <span m='552000'>It only has a slope at each point.</span>\
  \ <span m='554000'>It doesn't have any magnitude or direction.</span> <span m='557000'>It\
  \ has the direction, but it doesn't have direction</span> <span m='560000'>in the\
  \ sense of an arrow telling me whether it is going this way</span> <span m='564000'>or\
  \ the opposite way. That is the picture with t in</span> <span m='567000'>it. These\
  \ are the corresponding</span> <span m='570000'>degeneration of that. It is a coarsening,</span>\
  \ <span m='573000'>it's a cheapening of it. It is throwing away</span> <span m='576000'>information.\
  \ Throw away all the information</span> <span m='579000'>that had to do with t,\
  \ and we are back in the first</span> <span m='582000'>days of the terms with a\
  \ single first order equations involving</span> <span m='586000'>only x and y with\
  \ solutions that involve only x and y with curves</span> <span m='590000'>that are\
  \ the graphs of these solutions but again have no t in</span> <span m='594000'>them.\
  \ In effect, they are just the</span> <span m='597000'>paths of the trajectories.\
  \ Whereas, the trajectory is the</span> <span m='602000'>point that shows actually\
  \ how the point is moving along in</span> <span m='607000'>time faster or slower\
  \ at various points.</span> <span m='611000'>Now, why would one want to lose information?</span>\
  \ <span m='615000'>Well, the great gain is that this might be solvable.</span> <span\
  \ m='619000'>Whereas, this almost certainly is not.</span> <span m='623000'>That\
  \ is a big plus. For example,</span> <span m='625000'>let's illustrate it on the\
  \ very simplest possible case.</span> <span m='638000'>I cannot illustrate it on\
  \ a nonlinear system very well,</span> <span m='641000'>or not right now because,\
  \ in general, nonlinear systems</span> <span m='645000'>are not solvable. Let's\
  \ take an easy example.</span> <span m='649000'>Suppose the system were a linear\
  \ one, let's say this one</span> <span m='653000'>that we have talked about before,\
  \ in fact.</span> <span m='656000'>That is a simple linear two-by-two system.</span>\
  \ <span m='660000'>This means the derivatives with respect to time.</span> <span\
  \ m='662000'>Well, you know that the solutions we talked about in</span> <span m='666000'>fact,\
  \ last time, typical solutions that would be</span> <span m='669000'>something like\
  \ (x, y) equals a constant times,</span> <span m='671000'>let's say if x is cosine\
  \ t then y would be the</span> <span m='675000'>derivative of that, which is negative\
  \ sine t.</span> <span m='678000'>Or, another one would be c2</span> <span m='681000'>times\
  \ sine t, cosine t.</span> <span m='690000'>And those, of course, are circles.</span>\
  \ <span m='692000'>They are parametrized circles, so they are circles that go</span>\
  \ <span m='697000'>around, in fact, in this direction.</span> <span m='700000'>And\
  \ they have a certain velocity to them.</span> <span m='703000'>Now what do I do\
  \ if I follow this plan of eliminating t?</span> <span m='708000'>Well, if I eliminate\
  \ t directly from the system,</span> <span m='712000'>what will I get? I will get\
  \ dy by dx.</span> <span m='715000'>I divide this equation by that one.</span> <span\
  \ m='720000'>-- is equal to negative x over.</span> <span m='723000'>Oh, well, of\
  \ course, that is solvable.</span> <span m='726000'>You were able to solve by 18.01\
  \ methods before you ever come</span> <span m='731000'>into this course. By separation\
  \ of variables,</span> <span m='735000'>it is y dy equals negative x dx,</span>\
  \ <span m='739000'>which integrates to be one-half y squared equals negative</span>\
  \ <span m='744000'>one-half x squared plus a constant.</span> <span m='749000'>And\
  \ after multiplying through</span> <span m='753000'>by two and moving things around\
  \ it becomes x squared plus y</span> <span m='757000'>squared. The nicest way to\
  \ say it is</span> <span m='761000'>implicitly, x squared plus y squared equals\
  \ some positive</span> <span m='765000'>constant. These are the circles.</span>\
  \ <span m='767000'>Now, can I eliminate t? I could also take one of these</span>\
  \ <span m='771000'>solutions and eliminate t. If I square this,</span> <span m='774000'>the\
  \ best way to do it is not to use our cosines and arcsines and</span> <span m='779000'>whatnot,\
  \ which will just get you totally lost.</span> <span m='784000'>Square this, square\
  \ that and add them</span> <span m='786000'>together. And you conclude that x squared</span>\
  \ <span m='789000'>plus y squared is equal to one.</span> <span m='793000'>Or, if\
  \ c1 is not one it is equal to c1 squared.</span> <span m='796000'>You could eliminate\
  \ t from the solution the way you eliminate t</span> <span m='801000'>from a pair\
  \ of parametric equations, and you get it the</span> <span m='805000'>same way that\
  \ x squared plus y squared, in this case,</span> <span m='809000'>would be c1 squared,\
  \ I guess.</span> <span m='819000'>In some sense, what we are doing is cycling</span>\
  \ <span m='822000'>around to the beginning of the term.</span> <span m='824000'>In\
  \ fact, this whole lecture, as you will see,</span> <span m='828000'>is about cycles\
  \ of one sort or another.</span> <span m='831000'>But I keep thinking of that great\
  \ line of poetry,</span> <span m='834000'>\"in my end is my beginning\" or maybe\
  \ it's \"in my beginning is</span> <span m='839000'>my end\". I think both lines\
  \ occur.</span> <span m='843000'>But that is what is happening here.</span> <span\
  \ m='845000'>This is the beginning of the course and this is the end of</span> <span\
  \ m='848000'>the course, and they have this almost trivial relation between</span>\
  \ <span m='852000'>them. But notice the totally</span> <span m='854000'>different\
  \ methods used for analyzing this,</span> <span m='857000'>where the t is included,\
  \ than from analyzing this where</span> <span m='860000'>there is no t. The goals\
  \ are different,</span> <span m='862000'>what you look for are different, everything\
  \ is</span> <span m='865000'>different, and yet it is almost the same problem.</span>\
  \ <span m='870000'>I promised you a nonlinear example.</span> <span m='873000'>I\
  \ guess it is time to see what that is.</span> <span m='884000'>It is going to be\
  \ another predator-prey equation,</span> <span m='887000'>but one which is, in some\
  \ ways,</span> <span m='889000'>simpler than the one I gave you for homework.</span>\
  \ <span m='892000'>The predator is going to be x because you are used to that</span>\
  \ <span m='896000'>from the robins. I am keeping the same</span> <span m='899000'>predator-prey\
  \ variables. And the prey will be y.</span> <span m='903000'>And now just notice\
  \ the small difference from what I gave you</span> <span m='908000'>before. For\
  \ one thing,</span> <span m='909000'>I am not giving you specific numbers.</span>\
  \ <span m='912000'>I am going to, at the beginning at least,</span> <span m='915000'>do\
  \ some of the analysis at the beginning using letters,</span> <span m='919000'>using\
  \ parameters. a, b, c, d are always going to</span> <span m='922000'>be positive\
  \ constants. I am going to assume that x</span> <span m='926000'>prime equals minus\
  \ ax.</span> <span m='930000'>This represents the predator dying out if there is\
  \ no prey</span> <span m='936000'>there, but if there is something to eat that term\
  \ represents the</span> <span m='943000'>predator meeting up with the prey and gobbling\
  \ it up.</span> <span m='948000'>And b is the coefficient. How about without predictors,</span>\
  \ <span m='954000'>the prey will multiply and be fruitful.</span> <span m='960000'>Unfortunately\
  \ they get eaten, and so there will be a term</span> <span m='964000'>that looks\
  \ like this. Now, there are two basic</span> <span m='967000'>differences between\
  \ these simple equations and the slightly more</span> <span m='972000'>complicated\
  \ ones you had with the robin-earthworm equations.</span> <span m='976000'>Namely,\
  \ in the first place, I am assuming that these guys,</span> <span m='980000'>let's\
  \ give them names. I want you to remember which is</span> <span m='984000'>x and\
  \ which is y, so we are going to think of</span> <span m='987000'>these are \"sharx\"\
  . [LAUGHTER]</span> <span m='991000'>And these will be food fish, so let's make\
  \ them \"yumfish\".</span> <span m='1010000'>The fact that with your robins you\
  \ had a positive term here.</span> <span m='1014000'>I made this 2x. And now it\
  \ is minus a times x.</span> <span m='1017000'>What is the difference? The difference\
  \ is that robins</span> <span m='1022000'>have other things to eat, so even if there\
  \ are not any</span> <span m='1026000'>worms, a robin will survive. It could eat\
  \ other insects,</span> <span m='1030000'>grubs, Japanese beetle grubs. I think\
  \ it can even eat seeds.</span> <span m='1035000'>Anyway, the robins in my garden\
  \ seem to be pecking at things</span> <span m='1040000'>that don't seem to be insects.\
  \ And the other is that I am</span> <span m='1044000'>assuming a very na\u012Bve\
  \ growth law.</span> <span m='1047000'>For example, if there are no sharks,</span>\
  \ <span m='1050000'>how are the food fish fruitful and multiplying?</span> <span\
  \ m='1055000'>They multiple exponentially. Now, obviously you cannot have</span>\
  \ <span m='1059000'>unlimited growth like that. With the worms we added the</span>\
  \ <span m='1063000'>term minus a constant times y squared to indicate that even</span>\
  \ <span m='1068000'>worms cannot multiply purely exponentially forever,</span> <span\
  \ m='1071000'>but ultimately their growth levels off because they cannot</span>\
  \ <span m='1076000'>find enough organic matter to plow their way through.</span>\
  \ <span m='1081000'>Those are the two differences. I am not assuming a logistic</span>\
  \ <span m='1085000'>growth law. This is less sophisticated than</span> <span m='1088000'>the\
  \ one I gave you for homework. This assumes that sharks have</span> <span m='1092000'>absolutely\
  \ nothing to eat except these fish, which is not so bad.</span> <span m='1097000'>That's\
  \ true, more or less.</span> <span m='1105000'>My plan is now, with this model,</span>\
  \ <span m='1107000'>let's start the analysis, as you learned to do it.</span> <span\
  \ m='1110000'>And we are going to run into trouble at various places.</span> <span\
  \ m='1114000'>And the troubles will then illustrate these three points</span> <span\
  \ m='1118000'>that I wanted to add to your repertoire of things to do with</span>\
  \ <span m='1123000'>nonlinear systems when you run into trouble.</span> <span m='1127000'>And\
  \ it will also increase your understanding of the nonlinear</span> <span m='1130000'>systems.\
  \ The first thing we have to do</span> <span m='1132000'>is find the critical points.\
  \ I am going to assume that you</span> <span m='1136000'>are good at this and, therefore,\
  \ not spend a lot of</span> <span m='1139000'>time detailing the calculations. I\
  \ will simply write them on the</span> <span m='1144000'>board. The first equation\
  \ I am going</span> <span m='1146000'>to write down is x times minus a plus by equals\
  \ zero.</span> <span m='1151000'>And I assume you know why I am</span> <span m='1153000'>writing\
  \ that down. And the other equation will be</span> <span m='1157000'>y times c minus\
  \ dx is zero.</span> <span m='1160000'>Those are the simultaneous equations I have\
  \ to find to find</span> <span m='1164000'>the critical point. The first one is\
  \ if the product</span> <span m='1170000'>of these is zero, either x is zero or\
  \ the other</span> <span m='1174000'>factor is. So, from the second equation,</span>\
  \ <span m='1178000'>if x is zero, y has to be zero also.</span> <span m='1182000'>That\
  \ is one critical point. Now, if x is not zero then this</span> <span m='1188000'>factor\
  \ has to be zero which says that y must be equal</span> <span m='1194000'>to a over\
  \ b. And if y is equal to a over b,</span> <span m='1199000'>it is not zero here.\
  \ Therefore, this factor must be</span> <span m='1202000'>zero which says that x\
  \ is equal to c over d.</span> <span m='1206000'>You see right away that this must\
  \ be a simpler system because</span> <span m='1210000'>it is only producing two\
  \ critical points.</span> <span m='1212000'>Whereas, the system that you did for\
  \ homework had four.</span> <span m='1216000'>Here is one. Well, let's just write\
  \ them up</span> <span m='1219000'>here. The critical points are zero,</span> <span\
  \ m='1221000'>zero. That doesn't look terribly</span> <span m='1223000'>interesting,\
  \ but the other one looks more interesting.</span> <span m='1227000'>It is c over\
  \ d, a over b.</span> <span m='1231000'>Well, let's take a look first at the zero,\
  \ zero critical</span> <span m='1234000'>point. The origin, in other words.</span>\
  \ <span m='1237000'>What does that look like?</span> <span m='1244000'>Well, at\
  \ the origin, the linearization is extremely</span> <span m='1247000'>easy to do\
  \ because I simply ignore the quadratic terms,</span> <span m='1251000'>which are\
  \ the product of two small numbers,</span> <span m='1255000'>where these only have\
  \ a single small number in it.</span> <span m='1258000'>It is minus ax, cy.</span>\
  \ <span m='1261000'>In other words, the linearization matrix is</span> <span m='1263000'>minus\
  \ a, zero, zero and cy gives me a</span> <span m='1266000'>coefficient c there.</span>\
  \ <span m='1268000'>Now, I don't think at any point I have ever explicitly told\
  \ you</span> <span m='1272000'>that I hope you have learned from the homework or\
  \ maybe your</span> <span m='1276000'>recitation teacher, but for heaven's sake,</span>\
  \ <span m='1279000'>put this down in your little books, if you have a diagonal</span>\
  \ <span m='1283000'>matrix, for god's sake, don't calculate its</span> <span m='1286000'>eigenvalues.\
  \ They are right in front of you.</span> <span m='1290000'>They are always the diagonal\
  \ elements.</span> <span m='1292000'>The eigenvalue, you can check this out if you</span>\
  \ <span m='1295000'>insist on writing the equation, but trust me it is clear.</span>\
  \ <span m='1300000'>If I, for example, subtract c from the main</span> <span m='1303000'>diagonal,\
  \ I am going to get a determinant zero because the</span> <span m='1307000'>bottom\
  \ row will be all zero. The eigenvalues are negative a</span> <span m='1311000'>and\
  \ c. In other words,</span> <span m='1313000'>they have opposite signs. This is\
  \ a negative number.</span> <span m='1316000'>That is a positive number -- -- because\
  \ a,</span> <span m='1320000'>b, c and d are always positive. And, therefore,</span>\
  \ <span m='1323000'>this is automatically a saddle. You don't have to calculate</span>\
  \ <span m='1327000'>anything. It is all right in front of</span> <span m='1329000'>you.\
  \ It must be a saddle and,</span> <span m='1331000'>therefore, unstable because\
  \ all saddles are.</span> <span m='1333000'>And, in fact, you can even draw the\
  \ little</span> <span m='1336000'>picture of what the stuff looks like near the\
  \ origin without</span> <span m='1339000'>even bothering to calculate eigenvectors,</span>\
  \ <span m='1342000'>although it is extremely easy to do.</span> <span m='1344000'>Just\
  \ from common sense, these are the sharks and these</span> <span m='1347000'>are\
  \ the yumfish. Well, if there are zero</span> <span m='1351000'>yumfish, in other\
  \ words, if I am on the sharks axis,</span> <span m='1355000'>the axis of sharks,\
  \ I die out.</span> <span m='1358000'>Well, forget about this side. It's on the\
  \ positive side.</span> <span m='1362000'>That makes sense. But I die out because\
  \ the</span> <span m='1365000'>sharks have nothing to eat. Whereas, if I am on the\
  \ yumfish</span> <span m='1370000'>axis I go this way. I grow because,</span> <span\
  \ m='1372000'>without any sharks to eat them, the yumfish increase.</span> <span\
  \ m='1376000'>So it must look like that. And, therefore,</span> <span m='1380000'>the\
  \ saddle must look like this. The saddle curves hug those and</span> <span m='1384000'>go\
  \ nearby. Now, the other critical point</span> <span m='1387000'>is the interesting\
  \ one. And for that the analysis,</span> <span m='1390000'>in order that you don't\
  \ spend the rest of this period writing</span> <span m='1394000'>a's, b's, c's and\
  \ d's, I am going to make the</span> <span m='1397000'>simplifying assumption. But\
  \ it doesn't change</span> <span m='1400000'>qualitatively any of the mathematics.</span>\
  \ <span m='1402000'>It just makes it a little easier to write everything out.</span>\
  \ <span m='1406000'>I am going to assume that everything is one.</span> <span m='1410000'>Well,\
  \ in fact, even this would be good enough,</span> <span m='1413000'>but let's make\
  \ everything one. I am going to assume this.</span> <span m='1417000'>And it is\
  \ only to make the writing simpler.</span> <span m='1420000'>It doesn't really change\
  \ the mathematics at all.</span> <span m='1424000'>Well, if everything is one, in\
  \ order to calculate the</span> <span m='1427000'>linearized system, I'd better\
  \ use the Jacobian.</span> <span m='1431000'>But perhaps it would be better to write\
  \ out explicitly what the</span> <span m='1436000'>system is. The system now is\
  \ x prime</span> <span m='1438000'>equals minus x plus xy, all the coefficients\
  \ are</span> <span m='1443000'>one. And y prime is equal to y minus</span> <span\
  \ m='1447000'>xy. What is the Jacobian?</span> <span m='1450000'>Well, the Jacobian\
  \ is the partial of this with respect to</span> <span m='1454000'>x which is minus\
  \ one plus y, the partial with respect</span> <span m='1459000'>to y which is x,\
  \ the partial of this with</span> <span m='1462000'>respect to x, which is minus\
  \ y,</span> <span m='1464000'>and the partial with respect to y, which is one minus\
  \ x.</span> <span m='1468000'>But I want to evaluate that at</span> <span m='1472000'>the\
  \ point one, one,</span> <span m='1475000'>which is the critical point. It is the\
  \ critical point</span> <span m='1480000'>because I have assumed that all these\
  \ parameters have the value</span> <span m='1486000'>one. And when I do that,</span>\
  \ <span m='1488000'>evaluating it at one, one,</span> <span m='1491000'>I get what\
  \ matrix? Well, I get zero,</span> <span m='1494000'>one, negative one, zero.</span>\
  \ <span m='1497000'>In other words,</span> <span m='1501000'>the linearized system\
  \ is x prime equals y and y</span> <span m='1507000'>prime equals negative x.</span>\
  \ <span m='1511000'>Well, that is just the one we analyzed before in terms of --</span>\
  \ <span m='1523000'>It's the one whose solutions are circles.</span> <span m='1525000'>In\
  \ other words, what we find out is that the</span> <span m='1528000'>linearized\
  \ system is what geometric type?</span> <span m='1532000'>Saddle? Node?</span> <span\
  \ m='1534000'>Spiral? None of those.</span> <span m='1537000'>It is a center. The\
  \ linearized system is a</span> <span m='1544000'>center.</span> <span m='1552000'>It\
  \ consists, in other words,</span> <span m='1554000'>of a bunch of curves going\
  \ round and round next to each</span> <span m='1558000'>other. Concentric circles,</span>\
  \ <span m='1559000'>in fact. Well, what is wrong with that?</span> <span m='1563000'>Now,\
  \ we are in deep trouble. We are now in trouble because</span> <span m='1567000'>that\
  \ is a borderline case. Let me remind you of what the</span> <span m='1572000'>borderline\
  \ cases are. When we drew that picture,</span> <span m='1575000'>this is from last\
  \ week's problem set so you have a</span> <span m='1579000'>perfect excuse for forgetting\
  \ it totally.</span> <span m='1582000'>But I am trying to remind you of it.</span>\
  \ <span m='1585000'>That is another reason why I am doing this.</span> <span m='1590000'>Remember\
  \ that picture I asked you about that appeared on the</span> <span m='1594000'>computer\
  \ screen? Let's make it a little flatter</span> <span m='1598000'>so that I can\
  \ have room to write in.</span> <span m='1600000'>This is a certain parabola whose\
  \ equation you are dying to</span> <span m='1605000'>tell me, but I am not asking.\
  \ There is the trace,</span> <span m='1608000'>this is the determinant, and the\
  \ characteristic equation</span> <span m='1613000'>is related to the values of these\
  \ numbers like plus d equals</span> <span m='1617000'>zero. Then these were spiral\
  \ synchs.</span> <span m='1622000'>This was the region of spiral sources.</span>\
  \ <span m='1627000'>That is the abbreviation for sources.</span> <span m='1631000'>These\
  \ were nodal synchs and these were the nodal sources.</span> <span m='1638000'>And\
  \ down here were the saddles. And where were the centers?</span> <span m='1644000'>The\
  \ centers were along this line.</span> <span m='1650000'>The centers, there weren't\
  \ many of them,</span> <span m='1652000'>and they were the separation for these\
  \ two regions.</span> <span m='1656000'>I will put that down. These are the centers.</span>\
  \ <span m='1659000'>These other borderlines correspond to other things.</span> <span\
  \ m='1662000'>These are defective eigenvalues, zero eigenvalues</span> <span m='1665000'>and\
  \ so on. But let's concentrate on just</span> <span m='1668000'>one of them. You\
  \ will find the others</span> <span m='1670000'>discussed in the notes, GS7.</span>\
  \ <span m='1672000'>But if you get this idea then the rest is just details.</span>\
  \ <span m='1676000'>I think it will be perfectly clear.</span> <span m='1680000'>What\
  \ is wrong with the center? The answer is that if we are on</span> <span m='1684000'>the\
  \ center, for example, this system corresponds to the</span> <span m='1688000'>trace\
  \ being zero and the determinant being plus one.</span> <span m='1692000'>It corresponds\
  \ to t equals zero and d equals one.</span> <span m='1696000'>This point, in other\
  \ words. Now, if I wiggle the</span> <span m='1699000'>coefficients of the matrix\
  \ just a little bit,</span> <span m='1703000'>just change them a little bit, what\
  \ I am going to do is move</span> <span m='1707000'>off this pink line. And I might\
  \ move to here or I</span> <span m='1711000'>might move a little way to there.</span>\
  \ <span m='1714000'>But, if I do that, I change the geometric type.</span> <span\
  \ m='1717000'>In other words, being a borderline,</span> <span m='1719000'>a slight\
  \ change of the parameters can change what it</span> <span m='1722000'>changes to.\
  \ And, in fact,</span> <span m='1724000'>that is geometrically clear. What does\
  \ a center look like?</span> <span m='1728000'>A center looks like this, a bunch\
  \ of curves going around</span> <span m='1731000'>all in the same direction, like\
  \ concentric circles or</span> <span m='1735000'>maybe ellipses or something like\
  \ that.</span> <span m='1739000'>If I deform the picture just a little bit, well,</span>\
  \ <span m='1743000'>I might change it into something that looks like this</span>\
  \ <span m='1747000'>where, after they go around they don't quite meet up with where</span>\
  \ <span m='1752000'>they were to start with. And I am going to get a spiral</span>\
  \ <span m='1757000'>synch. Or, I might do the deformation</span> <span m='1760000'>by\
  \ going around once and I'm a little outside of where I was.</span> <span m='1765000'>In\
  \ which case it's going to be a spiral source.</span> <span m='1771000'>The fact\
  \ that just changing these curves a little bit can</span> <span m='1775000'>change\
  \ the picture to this or to that corresponds to the fact</span> <span m='1779000'>that\
  \ if you are on here with this value of t and d,</span> <span m='1783000'>zero and\
  \ one, and just change t and d a</span> <span m='1786000'>little bit, you are going\
  \ to move off into these regions.</span> <span m='1791000'>You might, of course,\
  \ stay on the pink line.</span> <span m='1794000'>It is not very likely. Where does\
  \ this leave us?</span> <span m='1799000'>Well, if the linear system is not stable\
  \ in the sense that if</span> <span m='1802000'>you change the parameters a little\
  \ bit it doesn't change the</span> <span m='1806000'>type. This is, after all,</span>\
  \ <span m='1807000'>only an approximation to the nonlinear system.</span> <span\
  \ m='1810000'>If in this approximation you cannot really predict the</span> <span\
  \ m='1813000'>behavior of very well when you change the parameters,</span> <span\
  \ m='1817000'>then from it you cannot tell what the original system looked</span>\
  \ <span m='1820000'>like. In other words,</span> <span m='1823000'>the nonlinear\
  \ system at one, one might be any one</span> <span m='1828000'>of the possibilities,\
  \ still a center or it might be a</span> <span m='1832000'>spiral synch or it might\
  \ be a spiral source.</span> <span m='1836000'>Any one of those three is a possibility.</span>\
  \ <span m='1839000'>It couldn't be a saddle because that is too far away.</span>\
  \ <span m='1844000'>It couldn't be a node. That is too far away,</span> <span m='1848000'>too.\
  \ But it could wander into either</span> <span m='1851000'>of these regions and,\
  \ therefore, the picture you</span> <span m='1855000'>cannot tell which of these\
  \ three it is just from this type of</span> <span m='1860000'>critical point analysis.\
  \ Well, that was Volterra's</span> <span m='1866000'>problem. By the way, the person\
  \ who</span> <span m='1868000'>introduced these equations and studied them systematically\
  \ in</span> <span m='1873000'>the way in which we are doing it here was Volterra.</span>\
  \ <span m='1877000'>And, in fact, he was interested in sharks and</span> <span m='1881000'>food\
  \ fish, as they were called. What do we do?</span> <span m='1884000'>Well, you have\
  \ to be smart. What Volterra did was he went</span> <span m='1889000'>to method\
  \ number one. Let's do it.</span> <span m='1898000'>Volterra said I got my equations\
  \ x prime equals minus x</span> <span m='1905000'>plus xy. y prime is equal to,</span>\
  \ <span m='1911000'>these are the food fish, y minus xy.</span> <span m='1918000'>Let's\
  \ eliminate t. And my problem is,</span> <span m='1923000'>of course, I am trying\
  \ to determine what type of critical</span> <span m='1927000'>point one, one is.\
  \ And the method we have used up</span> <span m='1931000'>until now has failed because\
  \ it gave us a borderline case,</span> <span m='1936000'>which is from that we cannot\
  \ deduce.</span> <span m='1939000'>He said let's eliminate t. And we get dy over\
  \ dx</span> <span m='1943000'>equals, I am going to factor, y times one minus x\
  \ on top.</span> <span m='1949000'>And on the bottom factor x negative one plus\
  \ y.</span> <span m='1954000'>You could solve that before you came into 18.03,</span>\
  \ <span m='1959000'>right? This you can separate</span> <span m='1962000'>variables.\
  \ Let's separate variables.</span> <span m='1966000'>The y's all go on one side,\
  \ so y goes down here.</span> <span m='1972000'>It is (y minus one) over y dy equals\
  \ --</span> <span m='1980000'>On the other side the dx gets moved up, one minus\
  \ x over x dx.</span> <span m='1983000'>Now, of course, you wouldn't dream of using</span>\
  \ <span m='1986000'>partial fractions on this. It would be illegal because,</span>\
  \ <span m='1989000'>even though it is a rational function, the quotient of two</span>\
  \ <span m='1993000'>polynomials, the degree of the top is not smaller than the</span>\
  \ <span m='1996000'>degree of the bottom. In other words,</span> <span m='1998000'>it\
  \ is a partial fraction so this degree must be bigger than</span> <span m='2002000'>that\
  \ one. And it isn't so you would have</span> <span m='2004000'>to first divide.\
  \ And if you divide by that then</span> <span m='2007000'>there is no point in using\
  \ partial fractions at all.</span> <span m='2017000'>Of course, you would have done\
  \ this by basic instant,</span> <span m='2021000'>I know. What is the solution?</span>\
  \ <span m='2023000'>It is y minus log y equals log x minus x plus some constant.</span>\
  \ <span m='2029000'>That is not the final constant</span> <span m='2033000'>I want\
  \ so I will give it a subscript one to indicate I want</span> <span m='2038000'>more.\
  \ This is very hard to see what</span> <span m='2042000'>that curve looks like.\
  \ We can make it look better by</span> <span m='2045000'>exponentiating. If I exponentiate\
  \ it,</span> <span m='2048000'>going back to high school mathematics, but I know\
  \ from</span> <span m='2051000'>experience that many of you are not too good at\
  \ this step,</span> <span m='2056000'>so that is another reason I am doing it, it\
  \ will be</span> <span m='2060000'>e to the y, times, that part is easy because</span>\
  \ <span m='2063000'>pluses and minuses change into times, times e to the negative</span>\
  \ <span m='2067000'>log y. Well, e to the log y is y.</span> <span m='2071000'>If\
  \ I put a minus sign in front</span> <span m='2075000'>of that, that sends it into\
  \ the denominator, so instead of being</span> <span m='2080000'>y it is one over\
  \ y Equals x, e to log x is x,</span> <span m='2084000'>e to the negative x</span>\
  \ <span m='2088000'>is, therefore, times one over e to the x.</span> <span m='2091000'>And\
  \ that is times the</span> <span m='2093000'>exponential of c1, which I will call\
  \ c2.</span> <span m='2098000'>And now if I combine them all and put them all on\
  \ one side it</span> <span m='2104000'>is x over e to the x times y over e to the\
  \ y is equal to yet</span> <span m='2110000'>another constant, one over c2.</span>\
  \ <span m='2114000'>This is my final constant so</span> <span m='2118000'>let's\
  \ call that c. In other words,</span> <span m='2121000'>the integral curves are\
  \ the graphs of this equation for</span> <span m='2127000'>different values of the\
  \ constant c.</span> <span m='2132000'>Well, of course you've graphed an equation\
  \ like that all the</span> <span m='2137000'>time. What am I going to do with this</span>\
  \ <span m='2141000'>stupid thing? Well, I deliberately picked</span> <span m='2144000'>something\
  \ which involved all your learning up until now.</span> <span m='2150000'>We are\
  \ now going into 18.02, right?</span> <span m='2153000'>You looked at that in 18.02\
  \ you would say this is the contour</span> <span m='2159000'>curve, these are contour\
  \ curves of the function --</span> <span m='2165000'>Well, let's write it out the\
  \ other way.</span> <span m='2167000'>It doesn't make any difference, but you are\
  \ more likely to have</span> <span m='2170000'>seen the function in this form. x\
  \ over e to the x</span> <span m='2173000'>you won't recognize, but this you will.</span>\
  \ <span m='2175000'>In fact, we have had it before this term.</span> <span m='2178000'>It\
  \ is one of the kinds of solutions you can add to second</span> <span m='2181000'>order\
  \ equations. Times y e to the negative y</span> <span m='2183000'>equals c. It is\
  \ the contour curves of</span> <span m='2186000'>this function. Let's call that\
  \ function,</span> <span m='2189000'>let's say, h of (x,y).</span> <span m='2192000'>Well,\
  \ of course you could throw it on Matlab,</span> <span m='2195000'>as you did in\
  \ 18.02 maybe, and ask Matlab to plot the</span> <span m='2199000'>function. But\
  \ Volterra didn't have that</span> <span m='2202000'>luxury. He was smart,</span>\
  \ <span m='2203000'>too. So let's be smart instead.</span> <span m='2213000'>What\
  \ is the function x? Let's use a neutral variable</span> <span m='2216000'>like\
  \ u and plot u e to the negative u.</span> <span m='2220000'>18.01. At zero, it\
  \ has the value zero.</span> <span m='2223000'>When u is small this has approximately\
  \ the value one and,</span> <span m='2228000'>therefore, it starts out like the\
  \ function u.</span> <span m='2232000'>As u goes to infinity, you know by L'Hopital's\
  \ rule</span> <span m='2236000'>that this goes to zero so it ends up like this.</span>\
  \ <span m='2240000'>Well, what on earth could it possibly do except rise to a</span>\
  \ <span m='2245000'>maximum? But where is that maximum?</span> <span m='2250000'>It\
  \ is easy to see there is a unique maximum just by 18.01.</span> <span m='2254000'>Take\
  \ the derivative, find out where the maximum</span> <span m='2257000'>point is and\
  \ you will find, perhaps you have already done</span> <span m='2261000'>it, this\
  \ is at one. The maximum occurs at one,</span> <span m='2264000'>that is where the\
  \ derivative is zero and the value there is one</span> <span m='2269000'>times e\
  \ to the minus one.</span> <span m='2272000'>It is one over e, in other words.</span>\
  \ <span m='2275000'>That is what the curve looks like.</span> <span m='2277000'>What\
  \ do the contour curves of this look like?</span> <span m='2282000'>Well, if we\
  \ are looking at the contour curves of the function</span> <span m='2287000'>h,\
  \ so here is x, here is y, and we want the</span> <span m='2291000'>contour curves\
  \ of the function h of (x, y),</span> <span m='2296000'>what do I know? Where is\
  \ its maximum?</span> <span m='2300000'>The maximum point of h of x, y is where?</span>\
  \ <span m='2304000'>Well, h is the product x e to the negative x times y e to the</span>\
  \ <span m='2310000'>minus y.</span> <span m='2315000'>This has its maximum at one,\
  \ this has its maximum at one,</span> <span m='2319000'>so where does h of (x, y)\
  \ head?</span> <span m='2323000'>Well, you have two factors. One makes each of them\
  \ the</span> <span m='2328000'>biggest they can be. The maximum must be exactly\
  \ at</span> <span m='2332000'>that critical point one, one.</span> <span m='2335000'>That\
  \ is our maximum point. Let's make it conspicuous.</span> <span m='2341000'>This\
  \ is the maximum point. It is the point one,</span> <span m='2345000'>one. It is\
  \ the point that makes the</span> <span m='2349000'>function biggest. Now, how about\
  \ the contour</span> <span m='2353000'>curves? Well, this is the top of the</span>\
  \ <span m='2356000'>mountain. What is it along the axes?</span> <span m='2359000'>Along\
  \ the axes, when either x or y is zero,</span> <span m='2363000'>the function has\
  \ the value zero, so it is biggest there.</span> <span m='2368000'>It has the value\
  \ zero here. So it is zero value.</span> <span m='2373000'>What are the contour\
  \ curves? Well, we must have a mountain</span> <span m='2378000'>peak here. This\
  \ is the unique maximum</span> <span m='2381000'>point. In fact, it is easy to see\
  \ the</span> <span m='2384000'>contour curves just surround it like that.</span>\
  \ <span m='2387000'>Now, the reason they cannot be spirals, well,</span> <span m='2391000'>in\
  \ the first place, you never see contour curves</span> <span m='2395000'>that were\
  \ spirals. That is a good reason.</span> <span m='2400000'>It is a mountain. That\
  \ is the way contour curves</span> <span m='2403000'>of a mountain look. But, all\
  \ right,</span> <span m='2406000'>that is not a good argument. But notice that along\
  \ each</span> <span m='2410000'>horizontal line here, I want to know how many times</span>\
  \ <span m='2414000'>can it intersect the contour curve?</span> <span m='2416000'>That\
  \ is the same as asking along one of these lines how</span> <span m='2420000'>many\
  \ times could it intersect? See, this is a graph of the</span> <span m='2425000'>function\
  \ along this horizontal line.</span> <span m='2429000'>And, therefore, how many\
  \ times can it intersect</span> <span m='2432000'>one of the contour curves the\
  \ same number of times that a</span> <span m='2436000'>horizontal line can intersect\
  \ this curve?</span> <span m='2439000'>Twice. Only once if you are exactly at</span>\
  \ <span m='2442000'>that height and after that never.</span> <span m='2444000'>But\
  \ here it can intersect each contour curve only twice which</span> <span m='2448000'>means\
  \ these things cannot be spirals.</span> <span m='2451000'>Otherwise, they would\
  \ intersect those horizontal and vertical</span> <span m='2455000'>lines many times\
  \ instead of just twice.</span> <span m='2460000'>That is what it looks like. In\
  \ fact, we can even put in the</span> <span m='2464000'>direction without any effort.\
  \ We know that the sharks die out</span> <span m='2469000'>without any food fish\
  \ and the food fish grow.</span> <span m='2473000'>Well, I think this has to be\
  \ clockwise.</span> <span m='2476000'>Of course, the guys nearby must be going the\
  \ same way.</span> <span m='2481000'>And, therefore, the guys near them must be</span>\
  \ <span m='2484000'>going the same way. And it is sort of a domino</span> <span\
  \ m='2488000'>effect. The direction spreads and there</span> <span m='2492000'>is\
  \ only one compatible way of making these.</span> <span m='2495000'>They all must\
  \ be going clockwise.</span> <span m='2497000'>What is happening, actually?</span>\
  \ <span m='2499000'>At this point there are a lot of sharks but not so many food</span>\
  \ <span m='2504000'>fish. The sharks eat the few</span> <span m='2506000'>remaining\
  \ food fish, and now the sharks start to die</span> <span m='2509000'>out because\
  \ they have nothing to eat.</span> <span m='2512000'>When they are practically gone,\
  \ the food fish can start growing</span> <span m='2516000'>again and grow and grow.\
  \ For a while they grow happily,</span> <span m='2522000'>and then the sharks suddenly\
  \ start being able to find them</span> <span m='2526000'>again. And the few remaining\
  \ sharks</span> <span m='2529000'>start eating them, the population of sharks grows,</span>\
  \ <span m='2533000'>the food fish start dying out again, and the cycle starts all</span>\
  \ <span m='2538000'>over again. Now, I wanted to talk about the</span> <span m='2541000'>qualitative\
  \ behavior. This is, in some ways,</span> <span m='2544000'>the most important part\
  \ of the lecture.</span> <span m='2549000'>I wanted to discuss, just as we did at\
  \ the beginning</span> <span m='2555000'>of the term, the effect of fishing with\
  \ nets at a constant</span> <span m='2563000'>rate k.</span> <span m='2571000'>Just\
  \ as near the beginning of the term, we talked about</span> <span m='2574000'>fishing\
  \ a single population. The only difference is,</span> <span m='2577000'>now there\
  \ are two populations. Both sharks and the food fish.</span> <span m='2582000'>Now,\
  \ what happens to the equations?</span> <span m='2585000'>Well, the equations start\
  \ out just as they were.</span> <span m='2590000'>I am now reverting to a and b.\
  \ You will see why.</span> <span m='2594000'>It's because we need the general coefficients.</span>\
  \ <span m='2598000'>Plus bxy. But, if we are fishing with</span> <span m='2601000'>nets,\
  \ then a certain fraction of the sharks in the sea get hauled</span> <span m='2607000'>in\
  \ by the net. And say the fishing rate is k.</span> <span m='2612000'>There is a\
  \ fishing term. We remove minus k times a</span> <span m='2616000'>certain fraction\
  \ of the sharks in the sea.</span> <span m='2620000'>How about the food fish? Well,\
  \ we remove them,</span> <span m='2624000'>too. And we don't distinguish</span>\
  \ <span m='2627000'>between sharks and food fish. This is cy minus dxy.</span> <span\
  \ m='2631000'>But we also remove a certain</span> <span m='2634000'>fraction of\
  \ them. Minus k times y.</span> <span m='2638000'>What, therefore, is the new system?</span>\
  \ <span m='2643000'>The new system is therefore x prime equals minus a plus k.</span>\
  \ <span m='2650000'>I am combining those two x terms.</span> <span m='2654000'>That\
  \ is times x. Plus bxy.</span> <span m='2657000'>And the y prime is c minus k times\
  \ y</span> <span m='2664000'>minus dxy.</span> <span m='2670000'>To solve these,\
  \ I do not have to go through the</span> <span m='2673000'>analysis. All I have\
  \ to do is change the</span> <span m='2677000'>numbers, change these coefficients\
  \ from a to a plus k</span> <span m='2681000'>and c minus k. The old critical point\
  \ was the</span> <span m='2686000'>point c over d, a over b.</span> <span m='2689000'>The\
  \ new critical point with</span> <span m='2692000'>fishing is what? Well, the parameters\
  \ have been</span> <span m='2696000'>changed by the addition of k. The new critical\
  \ point is c</span> <span m='2702000'>minus k over d and a plus k over d.</span>\
  \ <span m='2707000'>What is the effect of fishing?</span> <span m='2711000'>Well,\
  \ if the old critical point was over here,</span> <span m='2715000'>let's say this\
  \ is the point c over d and this is the</span> <span m='2721000'>point a over b,\
  \ that is the old critical point</span> <span m='2727000'>that was over here. The\
  \ result of fishing is to</span> <span m='2733000'>lower the value of x and raise\
  \ the value here.</span> <span m='2738000'>The new critical point is, this gets\
  \ lowered to c minus k</span> <span m='2744000'>over d, and this gets raised to\
  \ a plus</span> <span m='2750000'>k over b. In other words,</span> <span m='2754000'>the\
  \ new point is there. The effect of fishing is to --</span> <span m='2762000'>It\
  \ does not treat the sharks and the yumfish equally.</span> <span m='2767000'>The\
  \ effect of fishing lowers the shark population.</span> <span m='2771000'>See, the\
  \ critical point gives sort of the average shark</span> <span m='2777000'>population.\
  \ Of course, it cycles around</span> <span m='2780000'>these. But, on the average,</span>\
  \ <span m='2783000'>this gives how many sharks there are and how many food fish</span>\
  \ <span m='2788000'>there are. The new critical point with</span> <span m='2793000'>fishing\
  \ lowers the shark population and raises the food</span> <span m='2799000'>fish\
  \ population. That is not intuitive.</span> <span m='2802000'>And, in fact, that\
  \ was observed</span> <span m='2805000'>experimentally at a slightly different context.</span>\
  \ <span m='2810000'>And that is why Volterra started working on the problem.</span>\
  \ <span m='2815000'>I will need three more minutes. The most interesting</span>\
  \ <span m='2821000'>application of all is not to sharks and food fish.</span> <span\
  \ m='2823000'>I cannot assume that you are dramatically interested in how</span>\
  \ <span m='2827000'>many of them there are in the ocean, but you might be more</span>\
  \ <span m='2830000'>interested in this.</span> <span m='2840000'>That thing about\
  \ lowering is called Volterra's principle.</span> <span m='2845000'>Put that in\
  \ your books. Volterra's principle.</span> <span m='2849000'>Volterra is spelt over\
  \ there.</span> <span m='2863000'>-- has found more modern applications than sharks.</span>\
  \ <span m='2868000'>Suppose you consider fish in a pond.</span> <span m='2873000'>You\
  \ have mosquito larvae which breed in the pond.</span> <span m='2878000'>This happens.\
  \ And then suddenly there is a</span> <span m='2883000'>plague of mosquitoes and\
  \ concerned citizens.</span> <span m='2887000'>And this is what happened in the\
  \ '50s.</span> <span m='2891000'>That was before you were born, but not before I\
  \ was.</span> <span m='2896000'>What happened was a lot of mosquitoes.</span> <span\
  \ m='2899000'>Everybody said the mosquitoes breed in the little stagnant</span>\
  \ <span m='2905000'>ponds so spray DDT on them. DDT them.</span> <span m='2910000'>Dump\
  \ it in the ponds. That will kill all the larvae</span> <span m='2914000'>and we\
  \ won't get bitten anymore. When you put DDT in the pond,</span> <span m='2919000'>as\
  \ people did not realize at the time because these things</span> <span m='2924000'>were\
  \ new, of course you kill the mosquitoes, but you also kill</span> <span m='2929000'>the\
  \ fish because DDT is poisonous to fish.</span> <span m='2933000'>What, in effect,\
  \ you are doing mathematically is</span> <span m='2937000'>the same as harvesting\
  \ the fish population with the sharks and</span> <span m='2942000'>the food fish.\
  \ The result is,</span> <span m='2946000'>the fish are the predators because they\
  \ eat the mosquito</span> <span m='2951000'>larvae, big food, there was a certain</span>\
  \ <span m='2955000'>equilibrium, according to Volterra's principle.</span> <span\
  \ m='2960000'>With DDT that equilibrium moves to here.</span> <span m='2964000'>In\
  \ other words, the effect of indiscriminately</span> <span m='2968000'>spraying\
  \ the pond with DDT is to increase the number of</span> <span m='2974000'>mosquitoes\
  \ and kill fish. And, in fact,</span> <span m='2979000'>that is exactly what was\
  \ observed.</span> <span m='2982000'>The same thing was observed with the bird population\
  \ and</span> <span m='2988000'>insects. Spraying trees for insects to</span> <span\
  \ m='2991000'>get rid of some pests ends up killing more birds than it does</span>\
  \ <span m='2998000'>insects and the insects increase.</span> <span m='3001000'>Thanks.</span>\
