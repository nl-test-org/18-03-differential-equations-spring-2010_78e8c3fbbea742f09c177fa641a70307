transcript: '<p><span m=''7000''>I just recalling some of the notation we are going
  to need</span> <span m=''12000''>for today, and a couple of the facts that we''re
  going to use,</span> <span m=''18000''>plus trying to clear up a couple of confusions
  that the</span> <span m=''23000''>recitations report. This can be thought of two</span>
  <span m=''28000''>ways. It''s a formal polynomial in D,</span> <span m=''31000''>in
  the letter D. It just has the shape of the</span> <span m=''36000''>polynomial,
  D squared plus AD plus B.</span> </p><p><span m=''40000''>A and B are constant coefficients.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''42000''>But, it''s also, at the same time,</span> <span m=''45000''>if
  you think what it does, it''s a linear operator on</span> <span m=''49000''>functions.
  It''s a linear operator on</span> <span m=''52000''>functions like y of t. You think
  of it both ways:</span> <span m=''56000''>formal polynomial because we want to do
  things like factoring</span> <span m=''61000''>it, substituting two for D and things
  like that.</span> </p><p><span m=''66000''>Those are things you do with polynomials.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''68000''>You do them algebraically. You can take the formal</span>
  <span m=''71000''>derivative of the polynomial because it''s just sums of</span>
  <span m=''74000''>powers. On the other hand,</span> <span m=''76000''>as a linear
  operator, it does something to functions.</span> </p><p><span m=''79000''>It differentiates
  them, multiplies them by constants or</span> <span m=''83000''>something like that.
  So it''s, so to speak,</span> <span m=''85000''>has a dual aspect this way. And,
  that''s one of the things</span> <span m=''89000''>we are exploiting what we use
  operator methods to solve</span> <span m=''92000''>differential equations. Now,
  let me remind you of the</span> <span m=''97000''>key thing we were interested in.
  f of t:</span> <span m=''100000''>not any old function, we''ll get to that next
  time,</span> <span m=''104000''>but f of t, exponentials.</span> </p><p><span m=''106000''>So,
  it should be an exponential or something like an</span> <span m=''110000''>exponential,
  or pretty close to it, for example,</span> <span m=''114000''>something with sine
  t and cosine t,</span> <span m=''117000''>or e to the, that could be thought of
  as</span> <span m=''121000''>part of the real or imaginary part of a complex exponential.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''127000''>And, maybe by the end of today, we will have generalized
  that</span> <span m=''130000''>even little more. But basically,</span> <span m=''132000''>I''m
  interested in exponentials. Let''s make it alpha complex.</span> </p><p><span m=''136000''>That
  will at least take care of the cases, e to the ax times</span> <span m=''140000''>cosine
  bx, sin bx,</span> <span m=''143000''>which are the main cases. Those are the main
  cases.</span> </p><p><span m=''146000''>Then, remember the little table we made.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''150000''>I simply gave you the formula for the particular solution.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''154000''>So, what we''re looking for is we already know how to
  solve the</span> <span m=''159000''>homogeneous equation. What we want is that particular</span>
  <span m=''164000''>solution. And then, the recipe for it I</span> <span m=''167000''>gave
  you, these things were proved by the substitution rules</span> <span m=''172000''>and
  exponential shift rules. The recipe was that if f of t</span> <span m=''177000''>was,
  let''s make a little table.</span> </p><p><span m=''180000''>f of t is, well, it''s
  always e to the a t.</span> </p><p><span m=''183000''>So, in other words,</span>
  <span m=''187000''>it''s e to the a t. The cases are,</span> <span m=''190000''>so
  yp, what is the yp? Well, it is the normal case is</span> <span m=''193000''>yp
  equals e to that alpha t divided by the</span> <span m=''197000''>polynomial where
  you substitute, you take that polynomial,</span> <span m=''201000''>and wherever
  you see a D, you substitute the complex</span> <span m=''204000''>number, alpha.
  There, I''m thinking of it as a</span> <span m=''207000''>formal polynomial. I''m
  not thinking of it as an</span> <span m=''211000''>operator. Now, this breaks down.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''214000''>So, that''s the formula for the particular solution.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''217000''>The only trouble is, it breaks down if p of alpha is</span>
  <span m=''220000''>zero. So, we have to assume that it''s</span> <span m=''223000''>not.
  Now, if p of alpha is zero,</span> <span m=''225000''>that means alpha is a root
  of the polynomial,</span> <span m=''228000''>a zero of the polynomial is a better
  word.</span> </p><p><span m=''231000''>So, in that case, it will be e to the alpha
  t</span> <span m=''234000''>divided by p prime of alpha.</span> </p><p><span m=''237000''>Differentiate
  formally the polynomials, --</span> <span m=''242000''>-- and you will get 2D plus
  A.</span> </p><p><span m=''244000''>And now, substitute in the alpha.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''246000''>And, this will be okay provided p prime of alpha</span> <span m=''250000''>is
  not zero. That means that alpha is the</span> <span m=''252000''>simple root, simple
  zero of p. And then, there''s one more</span> <span m=''255000''>case, which, since
  I won''t need today, I won''t write on the</span> <span m=''259000''>board. But,
  you''ll need it for</span> <span m=''261000''>homework. So, make sure you know it.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''263000''>Another words, if this is zero,</span> <span m=''265000''>then
  you''ve got a double root. And, there is still a different</span> <span m=''268000''>formula.
  And, this is wrong because I</span> <span m=''270000''>forgot the t. Yes?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''273000''>I could tell on your faces. That was before,</span> <span
  m=''281000''>and now we are up to today. What we are interested in</span> <span
  m=''291000''>talking about today is what this has to do with the phenomenon of</span>
  <span m=''303000''>resonance. Everybody knows at least one</span> <span m=''309000''>case
  of resonance, I hope.</span> </p><p><span m=''311000''>A little kid is on his swing,
  right?</span> </p><p><span m=''314000''>Back and forth, and they are very,</span>
  <span m=''316000''>very little, so they want a push.</span> </p><p><span m=''319000''>Okay,
  well, everybody knows that to make the swing go,</span> <span m=''323000''>a swing
  has a certain natural frequency.</span> </p><p><span m=''327000''>It swings back
  and forth like that.</span> </p><p><span m=''331000''>It''s a simple pendulum. It''s
  actually damped,</span> <span m=''334000''>but let''s pretend that it isn''t.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''336000''>Everybody knows you want to push a kid on a swing so that</span>
  <span m=''341000''>they go high. You have to push with</span> <span m=''343000''>essentially
  the same frequency that the natural frequency of</span> <span m=''348000''>the spring,
  of the swing is. It''s automatic,</span> <span m=''351000''>because when you come
  back here, it gets to there,</span> <span m=''355000''>and that''s where you push.
  So, automatically,</span> <span m=''359000''>you time your pushes. But if you want
  the kid to</span> <span m=''364000''>stop, you just do the opposite. Push at the
  wrong time.</span> </p><p><span m=''368000''>So anyway, that''s resonance. Of course,
  there are more</span> <span m=''372000''>serious applications of it. It''s what
  made the Tacoma</span> <span m=''376000''>Bridge fall down, and I think movies of
  that are</span> <span m=''380000''>now being shown not merely on television, but
  in elementary</span> <span m=''384000''>school. Resonance is what made,</span> <span
  m=''387000''>okay, more resonance stories later.</span> </p><p><span m=''391000''>So,
  my aim is, what is this physical</span> <span m=''393000''>phenomenon, that to get
  a big amplitude you should have it</span> <span m=''398000''>match the frequency?
  What does that have to do with</span> <span m=''401000''>a differential equation?
  Well, the differential equation</span> <span m=''406000''>for that simple pendulum,
  let''s assume it''s undamped,</span> <span m=''410000''>will be of the type y double
  prime plus,</span> <span m=''413000''>I''m using t now since t is time.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''416000''>That will be our new independent variable,</span> <span m=''419000''>plus
  omega nought squared is the natural</span> <span m=''423000''>frequency of the pendulum
  or of the spring, or whatever it is</span> <span m=''428000''>that''s doing the
  vibrating. Yeah, any questions?</span> </p><p><span m=''435000''>What we''re doing
  is driving that with the cosine,</span> <span m=''443000''>with something of a different
  frequency.</span> </p><p><span m=''451000''>So, this is the input, or the driving
  term as it''s</span> <span m=''456000''>often called, or it''s sometimes called
  the</span> <span m=''460000''>forcing term. And, the point is I''m going to</span>
  <span m=''465000''>assume that the frequency is different.</span> </p><p><span m=''469000''>The
  driving frequency is different from the natural</span> <span m=''474000''>frequency.
  So, this is the input</span> <span m=''477000''>frequency. Okay, and now let''s
  simply</span> <span m=''481000''>solve the equation and see what we get.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''483000''>So, it''s if I write it using the operator,</span> <span
  m=''486000''>it''s D squared plus omega nought squared applied to y</span> <span
  m=''489000''>is equal to cosine.</span> </p><p><span m=''492000''>It''s a good idea
  to do this because the formulas are going</span> <span m=''495000''>to ask you to
  substitute into a polynomial.</span> </p><p><span m=''497000''>So, it''s good to
  have the polynomial right in front of you</span> <span m=''501000''>to avoid the
  possibility of error.</span> </p><p><span m=''503000''>Well, really what I want
  is the particular solution.</span> </p><p><span m=''506000''>It''s the particular
  solution that''s going to give me a pure</span> <span m=''510000''>oscillation.
  And, the thing to do is,</span> <span m=''513000''>of course, since this cosine,
  you want to make it complex.</span> </p><p><span m=''517000''>So, we are going to
  complexify the equation in order to be able</span> <span m=''522000''>to solve it
  more easily, and in order to be able to use</span> <span m=''525000''>those formulas.
  So, the complex equation is</span> <span m=''528000''>going to be D squared plus
  omega nought squared.</span> </p><p><span m=''532000''>Well, it''s going to be a</span>
  <span m=''535000''>complex, particular solution. So, I''ll call it y tilde.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''540000''>And, on the right-hand side, that''s going to be e to
  the i</span> <span m=''544000''>omega1 t. Cosine is the real part of</span> <span
  m=''547000''>this. So, when we get our answer,</span> <span m=''550000''>we want
  to be sure to take the real part of the answer.</span> </p><p><span m=''553000''>I
  don''t want the complex answer, I want its real part.</span> </p><p><span m=''557000''>I
  want the real answer, in other words,</span> <span m=''560000''>the really real
  answer, the real real answer.</span> </p><p><span m=''563000''>So, now without further
  ado, because of those beautiful,</span> <span m=''567000''>the problem has been
  solved once and for all by using the</span> <span m=''571000''>substitution rule.
  I did that for you on Monday.</span> </p><p><span m=''576000''>The answer is simply
  e to the i omega1 t</span> <span m=''581000''>divided by what? This polynomial with
  omega one</span> <span m=''585000''>substituted in for D. So, sorry, i omega one,</span>
  <span m=''589000''>the complex coefficient of t.</span> </p><p><span m=''593000''>So,
  it is substitute i omega for D, I omega one for D,</span> <span m=''597000''>and
  you get (i omega one) squared plus omega nought</span> <span m=''601000''>squared.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''606000''>Well, let''s make that look a little bit better.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''609000''>This should be e to the (i omega one t)</span> <span m=''614000''>divided
  by, now, what''s this?</span> </p><p><span m=''617000''>This is simply omega nought
  squared minus omega</span> <span m=''622000''>one squared. But, I want the real
  part of</span> <span m=''627000''>it. So, as one final,</span> <span m=''628000''>last
  step, the real part of that is what we call just the</span> <span m=''633000''>real
  particular solution, so, yp without the tilde</span> <span m=''637000''>anymore.
  And, the real part of this,</span> <span m=''642000''>well, this cosine plus i sine.
  And, the denominator,</span> <span m=''645000''>luckily, turns out to be real. So,
  it''s simply going to be</span> <span m=''650000''>cosine omega one t.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''652000''>That''s the top, divided by this thing,</span> <span m=''655000''>omega
  nought squared minus omega one squared.</span> </p><p><span m=''660000''>In other
  words,</span> <span m=''663000''>that''s the response. This is the input,</span>
  <span m=''667000''>and that''s what came out. Well, in other words,</span> <span
  m=''671000''>what one sees is, regardless of what natural</span> <span m=''675000''>frequency
  this system wanted to use for itself,</span> <span m=''680000''>at least for this
  solution, what it responds to is the</span> <span m=''685000''>driving frequency,
  the input frequency.</span> </p><p><span m=''690000''>The only thing is that the
  amplitude has changed,</span> <span m=''694000''>and in a rather dramatic way, if
  omega1, depending on the</span> <span m=''699000''>relative sizes of omega1 and
  omega2.</span> </p><p><span m=''703000''>Now, the interesting case is when omega
  one is very close to</span> <span m=''708000''>omega, the natural frequency. When
  you push it with</span> <span m=''713000''>approximately it''s natural frequency,
  then the solution is</span> <span m=''719000''>big amplitude. The amplitude is large.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''724000''>So, the solution looks like the frequency.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''727000''>The input might have looked like this.</span> </p><p><span m=''730000''>Well,
  it''s cosine, so it ought to start up here.</span> </p><p><span m=''733000''>The
  input might have looked like this, but the response will</span> <span m=''738000''>be
  a curve with the same frequency and still a pure</span> <span m=''742000''>oscillation.
  But, it will have much,</span> <span m=''744000''>much bigger amplitude. And, it''s
  because the</span> <span m=''748000''>denominator, omega nought squared minus omega</span>
  <span m=''752000''>one squared, is always zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''755000''>So,
  the response will, instead, look like this.</span> </p><p><span m=''761000''>Now,
  to all intents and purposes, that''s resonance.</span> </p><p><span m=''764000''>You
  are pushing something with approximately the same</span> <span m=''768000''>frequency,
  something that wants to oscillate.</span> </p><p><span m=''772000''>And, you are
  pushing it with approximately the same frequency</span> <span m=''777000''>that
  it would like to oscillate by itself.</span> </p><p><span m=''780000''>And, what
  that does is it builds up the amplitude</span> <span m=''785000''>Well, what happens
  if omega one is actually equal</span> <span m=''790000''>to omega zero? So, that''s
  the case I''d like to</span> <span m=''794000''>analyze for you now. Suppose the
  two are equal,</span> <span m=''798000''>in other words. Well, the problem is,</span>
  <span m=''801000''>of course, I can''t use that same solution.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''804000''>It isn''t applicable. But that''s why I gave you,</span> <span m=''808000''>derived
  for you using the exponential shift law last time,</span> <span m=''813000''>the
  second version, when it is a root.</span> </p><p><span m=''818000''>So, if omega
  one equals omega nought,</span> <span m=''822000''>so now our equation looks like
  D squared plus omega nought</span> <span m=''827000''>squared, the natural frequency,
  y.</span> </p><p><span m=''831000''>But this time, the driving frequency,</span>
  <span m=''834000''>the input frequency, is omega nought itself.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''837000''>Then, the same analysis, a lot of it is,</span> <span m=''840000''>well,
  I''d better be careful. I''d better be careful.</span> </p><p><span m=''844000''>Let''s
  go through the analysis again very rapidly.</span> </p><p><span m=''850000''>What
  we want to do is first complexify it,</span> <span m=''853000''>and then solve.
  So, the complex equation will</span> <span m=''857000''>be D squared plus omega
  nought squared times y tilde equals e</span> <span m=''862000''>to the i omega nought
  t, this time.</span> </p><p><span m=''869000''>But now, i omega is zero of this
  polynomial.</span> </p><p><span m=''872000''>That''s why I picked it, right?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''875000''>If I plug in i omega zero, I get i omega zero</span> <span
  m=''880000''>quantity squared plus omega nought squared.</span> </p><p><span m=''886000''>That''s
  zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''888000''>So, I''m in the second case. So, i omega
  nought is a simple</span> <span m=''893000''>root, simple zero, of D squared plus</span>
  <span m=''898000''>omega nought, that polynomial squared.</span> </p><p><span m=''904000''>Therefore,
  the complex particular solution is now t e</span> <span m=''908000''>to the i omega
  nought t divided by p prime,</span> <span m=''913000''>where you plug in that root,
  the i omega nought.</span> </p><p><span m=''917000''>Now, what''s p prime?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''919000''>p prime is 2D, right?</span> </p><p><span m=''922000''>If
  I differentiate this formally, as if D were a</span> <span m=''926000''>variable,
  the way you differentiate polynomials,</span> <span m=''929000''>the derivative,
  this is a constant,</span> <span m=''932000''>and the derivative is 2D. So, the
  denominator should have</span> <span m=''938000''>two times for D. You are going
  to plug in i</span> <span m=''942000''>omega zero. So, it''s 2 i omega zero.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''947000''>And now, I want the real part</span> <span m=''951000''>of
  that, which is what? Well, think about it.</span> </p><p><span m=''955000''>The
  top is cosine plus i sine. The real part is now going to</span> <span m=''960000''>come
  from the sine, right, because it''s cosine plus</span> <span m=''965000''>i sine.
  But this i is going to divide</span> <span m=''969000''>out the i that goes with
  this sine.</span> </p><p><span m=''971000''>And, therefore, the real part is going
  to be t</span> <span m=''975000''>times the sine, this time, of omega nought t.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''978000''>And, that''s going to be divided</span> <span m=''982000''>by,
  well, the i canceled out the i that was in front of the sine</span> <span m=''987000''>function.
  And therefore,</span> <span m=''988000''>what''s left is two omega nought down below.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''994000''>So, that''s our particular solution now.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''996000''>Well, it looks different from that guy.</span> </p><p><span m=''999000''>It
  doesn''t look like that anymore.</span> </p><p><span m=''1002000''>What does it
  look like? Well, it shows the way to plot</span> <span m=''1006000''>such things
  is basically it''s an oscillation of frequency omega</span> <span m=''1010000''>nought.
  But, its amplitude is changing.</span> </p><p><span m=''1014000''>So, the way to
  do it is, as always, if you have a basic</span> <span m=''1018000''>oscillation
  which is neither too fast nor too slow,</span> <span m=''1022000''>think of that
  as the thing, and the other stuff multiplying</span> <span m=''1026000''>it, think
  of it as changing the amplitude of that oscillation</span> <span m=''1030000''>with
  time. So, the amplitude is that</span> <span m=''1034000''>function, t divided by
  two omega zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''1038000''>So, just as we did when we talked
  about damping,</span> <span m=''1041000''>you plot that and it''s negative on the
  picture.</span> </p><p><span m=''1045000''>So, this is the function whose graph
  is t divided by two omega</span> <span m=''1049000''>nought. That''s the changing
  amplitude,</span> <span m=''1054000''>as it were. And then, the function itself</span>
  <span m=''1057000''>does what oscillation it can, but it has to stay within those</span>
  <span m=''1061000''>lines. So, the thing that''s</span> <span m=''1063000''>oscillating
  is sine omega nought t,</span> <span m=''1067000''>which would like to be a pure
  oscillation, but can''t because</span> <span m=''1072000''>its amplitude is being
  changed by that thing.</span> </p><p><span m=''1075000''>So, it''s doing this, and
  now the rest I have to</span> <span m=''1078000''>leave to your imagination. In
  other words,</span> <span m=''1083000''>what happens when omega nought is equal
  to, when the driving</span> <span m=''1087000''>frequency is actually equal to omega
  nought,</span> <span m=''1091000''>mathematically this turns into a different looking
  solution,</span> <span m=''1095000''>one with steadily increasing amplitude.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1098000''>The amplitude increases linearly like the function t</span>
  <span m=''1102000''>divided by two omega nought.</span> </p><p><span m=''1105000''>Well,
  many people are upset by this, slightly,</span> <span m=''1109000''>in the sense
  that there is a funny feeling.</span> </p><p><span m=''1112000''>How is it that
  that solution can turn into this one?</span> </p><p><span m=''1118000''>If I simply
  let omega one go to omega zero, what happens?</span> </p><p><span m=''1123000''>Well,
  the pink curve just gets taller and taller,</span> <span m=''1127000''>and after
  a while all you see of it is just a bunch of</span> <span m=''1132000''>vertical
  lines which seem to be spaced at whatever the right</span> <span m=''1137000''>period
  is for that function. It''s sort of like being in a</span> <span m=''1143000''>first
  story window and watching a giraffe go by.</span> </p><p><span m=''1148000''>All
  you see is that. Okay.</span> </p><p><span m=''1160000''>So, my concern is how does
  that function turn into this one?</span> </p><p><span m=''1164000''>I have something
  in mind to remind you of,</span> <span m=''1167000''>and that''s why we''ll go through
  this little exercise.</span> </p><p><span m=''1171000''>It''s a simple exercise.
  But the function of it is,</span> <span m=''1175000''>of course that as omega one
  goes to omega zero cannot</span> <span m=''1179000''>possibly turn into this. It''s
  doing the wrong thing near</span> <span m=''1183000''>zero. It''s already zooming
  up.</span> </p><p><span m=''1185000''>But, the point is, this is not the only particular</span>
  <span m=''1189000''>solution on the block. Any solution whatsoever of the</span>
  <span m=''1192000''>differential equation, the inhomogeneous equation,</span> <span
  m=''1196000''>is a particular solution. It''s like Fred Rogers:</span> <span m=''1201000''>everybody
  is special. Okay, so all solutions are</span> <span m=''1205000''>special. We don''t
  have to use that one.</span> </p><p><span m=''1208000''>So, I will use, where are
  all the other</span> <span m=''1211000''>solutions? So, I''m going back to the</span>
  <span m=''1214000''>equation D squared plus omega zero squared,</span> <span m=''1218000''>applied
  to y,</span> <span m=''1220000''>is equal to cosine omega one t.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1224000''>Now, the particular solution we found was that one,</span> <span m=''1227000''>cosine
  omega one t divided by that omega nought squared minus</span> <span m=''1232000''>omega
  one squared.</span> </p><p><span m=''1239000''>What do the other particular solutions
  look like?</span> </p><p><span m=''1244000''>Well, in general, any particular solution
  will</span> <span m=''1249000''>look like that one we found, what is it, omega nought</span>
  <span m=''1254000''>squared minus omega one squared,</span> <span m=''1261000''>plus
  I''m allowed to add to it any piece of the complementary</span> <span m=''1267000''>solution.
  Equally particular,</span> <span m=''1271000''>and equally good, as a particular
  solution is</span> <span m=''1274000''>this plus anything which solved the homogeneous
  equation.</span> </p><p><span m=''1278000''>Now, all I''m going to do is pick out
  one good function which</span> <span m=''1283000''>solves the homogeneous equation,
  and here it is.</span> </p><p><span m=''1286000''>It''s the function minus cosine.
  In fact, what does solve the</span> <span m=''1292000''>homogeneous equation? Well,
  it''s solved by sine omega</span> <span m=''1296000''>nought t, cosine omega nought
  t,</span> <span m=''1300000''>and any linear combination of</span> <span m=''1304000''>those.
  So, out of all those functions,</span> <span m=''1307000''>the one I''m going to
  pick is cosine omega nought t.</span> </p><p><span m=''1311000''>And, I''m going
  to divide it by this same guy.</span> </p><p><span m=''1315000''>So, this is part
  of the complementary solution.</span> </p><p><span m=''1320000''>That''s what we
  call the complementary solution,</span> <span m=''1322000''>the solution to the
  associated homogeneous equation,</span> <span m=''1326000''>to the reduced equation.
  Call it what you like.</span> </p><p><span m=''1328000''>So, this is one of the
  guys in there, and it''s still a</span> <span m=''1332000''>particular solution
  to take the one I first found,</span> <span m=''1335000''>and add to it anything
  which solves the homogeneous equation.</span> </p><p><span m=''1339000''>I showed
  you that when we first set out to solve the</span> <span m=''1342000''>inhomogeneous
  equation in general.</span> </p><p><span m=''1344000''>Now, why do I pick that?
  Well, I''m going to now</span> <span m=''1347000''>calculate, what''s the limit?
  So, these guys are also good</span> <span m=''1351000''>solutions to that. This
  is a good solution to that</span> <span m=''1355000''>equation, this equation. All
  I''m going to do now is</span> <span m=''1358000''>calculate the limit as omega
  one approaches omega zero of this</span> <span m=''1362000''>function. Well, what
  is that?</span> </p><p><span m=''1366000''>It''s cosine omega one t minus cosine
  omega zero t divided by</span> <span m=''1370000''>omega nought squared minus omega
  one squared.</span> </p><p><span m=''1377000''>Now, you see why I did that. If I
  let just this guy,</span> <span m=''1382000''>omega one approaches omega zero,</span>
  <span m=''1387000''>I get infinity. I don''t get anything.</span> </p><p><span m=''1390000''>But,
  this is different here because I fixed it up,</span> <span m=''1394000''>now. The
  denominator becomes zero,</span> <span m=''1397000''>but so does the numerator.
  In other words,</span> <span m=''1401000''>I''ve put myself in position to use L''Hopital
  rule.</span> </p><p><span m=''1406000''>So, let''s L''Hopital it. It''s the limit.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1409000''>As omega one approaches omega zero, and what do you do?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1414000''>You differentiate the top and the bottom with respect
  to what?</span> </p><p><span m=''1422000''>Right, with respect to omega one.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1424000''>Omega one is the variable. That''s what''s changing.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1427000''>The t that I''m thinking of is, I''m thinking,</span>
  <span m=''1430000''>for the temporary fixed. This has a fixed value.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1433000''>Omega nought is fixed. All that''s changing in this</span> <span m=''1437000''>limit
  operation is omega one. And therefore,</span> <span m=''1441000''>it''s with respect
  to omega one that I differentiate it.</span> </p><p><span m=''1445000''>You got
  that? Well, you are in no position to</span> <span m=''1448000''>say yes or no,
  so I shouldn''t even ask the</span> <span m=''1451000''>question, but okay, rhetorical
  question.</span> </p><p><span m=''1454000''>All right, let''s differentiate this
  expression,</span> <span m=''1457000''>the top and bottom with respect to omega
  one.</span> </p><p><span m=''1460000''>So, the derivative of the top with respect
  to omega one is</span> <span m=''1464000''>negative sine omega one t.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1468000''>But, I have to use the chain rule.</span> </p><p><span m=''1472000''>That''s
  differentiating with respect to this argument,</span> <span m=''1475000''>this variable.
  But now, I must take times the</span> <span m=''1478000''>derivative of this thing
  with respect to omega one.</span> </p><p><span m=''1483000''>And that is t is the
  constant, so times t.</span> </p><p><span m=''1486000''>And, how about the bottom?
  The derivative of the bottom</span> <span m=''1489000''>with respect to omega one
  is, well, that''s a constant.</span> </p><p><span m=''1493000''>So, it becomes zero.
  And, this becomes negative two</span> <span m=''1497000''>omega one. So, it''s the
  limit of this</span> <span m=''1501000''>expression as omega one approaches omega
  zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''1505000''>And now it''s not indeterminate</span> <span
  m=''1509000''>anymore. The answer is,</span> <span m=''1510000''>the negative signs
  cancel. It''s simply t sine omega nought</span> <span m=''1515000''>t divided by
  two omega nought.</span> </p><p><span m=''1519000''>So, that''s how we get that</span>
  <span m=''1521000''>solution. It is a limit as omega one,</span> <span m=''1524000''>but
  not of the particular solution we found</span> <span m=''1528000''>first, but of
  this other one. Now, it''s still too much</span> <span m=''1534000''>algebra. I
  mean, what''s going on here?</span> </p><p><span m=''1537000''>Well, that''s something
  else you should know.</span> </p><p><span m=''1541000''>Okay, so my question is,
  therefore, what does this mean?</span> </p><p><span m=''1546000''>What''s the geometric
  meaning of all this?</span> </p><p><span m=''1550000''>In other words, what does
  that function look</span> <span m=''1554000''>like? Well, that''s another</span>
  <span m=''1556000''>trigonometric identity, which in your book is just</span> <span
  m=''1561000''>buried as half of one line sort of casual as if everybody knows</span>
  <span m=''1567000''>it, and I know that virtually no one knows it.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1573000''>But, here''s your chance. So, the cosine of B minus the</span> <span
  m=''1577000''>cosine of A can be expressed as a product of</span> <span m=''1582000''>signs.
  It''s the sine of (A minus B)</span> <span m=''1585000''>over two times the sine
  of (A plus B) over two,</span> <span m=''1589000''>I believe.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1593000''>My only uncertainty: is there a two in front of</span> <span m=''1597000''>that?
  I think there has to be.</span> </p><p><span m=''1600000''>Let me check. Sorry.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1602000''>Is there a two? I wouldn''t trust my memory</span> <span
  m=''1606000''>anyway. I''d look it up.</span> </p><p><span m=''1609000''>I did look
  it up, two, yes.</span> </p><p><span m=''1611000''>If you had to prove that, you
  could use the sine formula</span> <span m=''1617000''>to expand this out. That would
  be a bad way to do</span> <span m=''1623000''>it. The best way is to use complex</span>
  <span m=''1625000''>numbers. Express the sign in terms of</span> <span m=''1628000''>complex
  numbers, exponentials,</span> <span m=''1630000''>you know, the backwards Euler
  formula.</span> </p><p><span m=''1633000''>Then do it here, and then just multiply
  those</span> <span m=''1637000''>two expressions involving exponentials together,</span>
  <span m=''1640000''>and cancel, cancel, cancel, cancel,</span> <span m=''1643000''>cancel,
  and this is what you will end up with.</span> </p><p><span m=''1646000''>You see
  why I did this. It''s because this has that</span> <span m=''1651000''>form. So,
  let''s apply that formula to</span> <span m=''1653000''>it. So, what''s the left-hand
  side?</span> </p><p><span m=''1656000''>B is omega one t, and A is omega nought
  t.</span> </p><p><span m=''1659000''>So, this is omega one t,</span> <span m=''1662000''>and
  this is omega nought t</span> <span m=''1664000''>All right, so what we get is</span>
  <span m=''1667000''>that the cosine of omega one t minus the cosine of omega nought</span>
  <span m=''1671000''>t, which is exactly the</span> <span m=''1674000''>numerator
  of this function that I''m trying to get a handle on.</span> </p><p><span m=''1680000''>Then
  we will divide it by its amplitude.</span> </p><p><span m=''1682000''>So, that''s
  this constant factor that''s real.</span> </p><p><span m=''1685000''>It''s a small
  number because I''m thinking of omega one</span> <span m=''1690000''>as being rather
  close to omega zero,</span> <span m=''1693000''>and getting closer and closer. What
  does this tell us about</span> <span m=''1697000''>the right-hand side? Well, the
  right-hand side is</span> <span m=''1701000''>twice the sine of A minus B.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1704000''>Now, that''s good because these guys sort of resemble
  each</span> <span m=''1708000''>other. So, that''s (omega nought minus</span> <span
  m=''1712000''>omega one) times t.</span> </p><p><span m=''1715000''>That''s A minus
  B, and I''m supposed to divide that</span> <span m=''1719000''>by two. And then,
  the other one will be</span> <span m=''1722000''>the same thing with plus: sine
  omega nought plus omega</span> <span m=''1726000''>one over two times t.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1730000''>Now, how big is this, approximately?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1732000''>Remember, think of omega one as close to omega zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1736000''>Then, this is approximately</span> <span m=''1739000''>omega zero.
  So this part is approximately</span> <span m=''1743000''>sine of omega zero t.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1746000''>This part, on the other hand, that''s a very small thing.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1749000''>Okay, now what I want to know is what does this function
  look</span> <span m=''1753000''>like? The interest in knowing what</span> <span
  m=''1755000''>the function looks like it is because we want to be able to</span>
  <span m=''1759000''>see that it''s limited is that thing.</span> </p><p><span m=''1761000''>You
  can''t tell what''s what its limit is, geometrically,</span> <span m=''1765000''>unless
  you know it looks like. So, what does it look like?</span> </p><p><span m=''1770000''>Well,
  again, the way to analyze it is the</span> <span m=''1775000''>thing, that thing.
  What you think of is,</span> <span m=''1781000''>yeah, of course you cannot divide
  one side of equality</span> <span m=''1789000''>without dividing the equation by
  the other side.</span> </p><p><span m=''1796000''>So, that''s got to be there, too.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1802000''>Now, what does that look like? Well, the way to think
  of it</span> <span m=''1806000''>is, here is something with a normal sort of frequency,</span>
  <span m=''1810000''>omega nought. It''s doing its thing.</span> </p><p><span m=''1814000''>It''s
  a sine curve. It''s doing that.</span> </p><p><span m=''1816000''>What''s this?
  Think of all this part as</span> <span m=''1819000''>varying amplitude. It''s just
  another example of</span> <span m=''1823000''>what I gave you before. Here is a
  basic,</span> <span m=''1826000''>pure oscillation, and now, think of everything</span>
  <span m=''1829000''>else that''s multiplying it as varying its amplitude.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1835000''>All right, so what does that thing look like?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1838000''>Well, first what we want to do is plot the amplitude
  lines.</span> </p><p><span m=''1844000''>Now, what will they be? This is sine of
  an extremely</span> <span m=''1848000''>small number times t. The frequency is small.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1852000''>How does the sine curve look if its frequency is very
  low,</span> <span m=''1857000''>very close to zero? Well, that must mean its period</span>
  <span m=''1862000''>is very large. Here''s something with a big</span> <span m=''1865000''>frequency.
  Here''s something with a very,</span> <span m=''1868000''>very low frequency. Now,
  with a low frequency,</span> <span m=''1871000''>it would hardly get off the ground
  and get up to one here,</span> <span m=''1875000''>and it would do that. But, it''s
  made to look a little</span> <span m=''1879000''>more presentable because of this
  coefficient in front,</span> <span m=''1883000''>which is rather large. And so,
  what this thing looks</span> <span m=''1887000''>like, I won''t pause to analyze
  it more exactly.</span> </p><p><span m=''1892000''>It''s something which goes up
  at a reasonable rate for quite a</span> <span m=''1896000''>while, and let''s say
  that''s quite awhile.</span> </p><p><span m=''1899000''>And then it comes down,
  and then it goes,</span> <span m=''1902000''>and so on. Of course, in figuring out
  its</span> <span m=''1905000''>amplitude, we have to be willing to draw its negative,</span>
  <span m=''1909000''>too. And since I didn''t figure</span> <span m=''1911000''>things
  out right, I can at least make it cross,</span> <span m=''1914000''>right? Okay.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1915000''>So, this is a picture of this slowly varying amplitude.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1921000''>And in between, this is the function which is</span>
  <span m=''1925000''>doing the oscillation, as well as it can.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1928000''>But, it has to stay within that amplitude.</span> </p><p><span m=''1932000''>So,
  it''s doing this. Now, what happens?</span> </p><p><span m=''1935000''>As omega
  one approaches omega zero,</span> <span m=''1941000''>this frequency gets closer
  and closer to zero,</span> <span m=''1945000''>which means the period of that dotted
  line gets further and</span> <span m=''1950000''>further out, goes to infinity,
  and you never do ultimately get</span> <span m=''1955000''>a chance to come down
  again. All you can see is the initial</span> <span m=''1962000''>part, where it''s
  rising and rising.</span> </p><p><span m=''1965000''>And, that''s how this curve
  turns into that one.</span> </p><p><span m=''1969000''>Now, of course, this curve
  is enormously</span> <span m=''1972000''>interesting. You must have had this</span>
  <span m=''1975000''>somewhere. That''s the phenomenon of what</span> <span m=''1979000''>are
  called beats. Too frequencies--</span> <span m=''1983000''>Your book has half a
  page explaining this.</span> </p><p><span m=''1985000''>That''s the half a page
  where he gives you this identity,</span> <span m=''1989000''>except it gives it
  in a wrong form, so that it''s hard to</span> <span m=''1993000''>figure out. But
  anyway, the beats are two</span> <span m=''1996000''>frequencies when you combine
  them, the two frequencies being</span> <span m=''2000000''>two combined pure oscillations
  where the frequencies are very</span> <span m=''2004000''>close to each other. What
  you get is a curve which</span> <span m=''2007000''>looks like that. And, of course,</span>
  <span m=''2011000''>what you hear is the envelope of the curve.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2014000''>You hear the dotted lines. Well, you hear this.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2017000''>You hear that, too.</span> </p><p><span m=''2019000''>But, what you
  hear is-- And, that''s how good violinists and</span> <span m=''2023000''>cellists,
  and so on, tune their instruments.</span> </p><p><span m=''2026000''>They get one
  string right, and then the other strings are</span> <span m=''2031000''>tuned by
  listening. They don''t actually listen for</span> <span m=''2034000''>the sound
  of the note. They listened just for the</span> <span m=''2038000''>beats, wah, wah,
  wah, wah, and they turn the peg</span> <span m=''2042000''>and it goes wah, wah,
  wah, wah,</span> <span m=''2044000''>and then finally as soon as the wahs disappear,</span>
  <span m=''2047000''>they know that the two strings are in tune.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2053000''>A piano tuner does the same thing.</span> </p><p><span m=''2056000''>Of
  course, I, being a very bad cellist,</span> <span m=''2059000''>use a tuner. That''s
  another solution,</span> <span m=''2062000''>a more modern solution. Okay.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2089000''>Oh well. Let''s give it a try.</span> </p><p><span m=''2091000''>The
  bad news is that problem six in your problem set,</span> <span m=''2095000''>I didn''t
  ask you about the undamped case.</span> </p><p><span m=''2098000''>I thought, since
  you are mature citizens, you could be asked</span> <span m=''2103000''>about the
  damped case.</span> </p><p><span m=''2121000''>I warn you, first of all you have
  to get the notation.</span> </p><p><span m=''2126000''>This is probably the most
  important thing I''ll do with</span> <span m=''2131000''>this. Your book uses this,
  resonance.</span> </p><p><span m=''2162000''>I''m optimistic. [LAUGHTER] Let''s
  say zero or f</span> <span m=''2166000''>of t. It doesn''t matter.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2169000''>In other words, the constants,</span> <span m=''2172000''>the book
  uses two sets of constants to describe these</span> <span m=''2177000''>equations.
  If it''s a spring,</span> <span m=''2180000''>and not even talking about RLC circuits,
  the spring mass,</span> <span m=''2186000''>damping, k, spring constant. Then you
  divide out by m and</span> <span m=''2193000''>you get this. You''re familiar with
  that.</span> </p><p><span m=''2196000''>And, it''s only after you divided out by
  the m that you''re</span> <span m=''2201000''>allowed to call this the square of
  the natural frequency.</span> </p><p><span m=''2206000''>So, omega naught is the
  natural frequency, the natural undamped</span> <span m=''2211000''>frequency. If
  this term were not there,</span> <span m=''2214000''>that omega nought would give
  the frequency with</span> <span m=''2219000''>which the system, the little spring
  would like to</span> <span m=''2223000''>vibrate by itself. Now, further complication
  is</span> <span m=''2228000''>that the visual uses neither of these.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2231000''>The visual uses x double dot plus b times x prime,</span> <span m=''2236000''>I
  think we will have to fix this in the future,</span> <span m=''2240000''>but for
  now, just live with it,</span> <span m=''2242000''>plus kx, and that''s some function,</span>
  <span m=''2247000''>again, a function. So, in other words,</span> <span m=''2250000''>the
  problem is that b is okay, can''t be confused with c.</span> </p><p><span m=''2257000''>On
  the other hand, this is not the same k as that.</span> </p><p><span m=''2262000''>What
  I''m trying to say is, don''t automatically go to a</span> <span m=''2268000''>formula
  one place, and assume it''s the same</span> <span m=''2273000''>formula in another
  place. You have to use these</span> <span m=''2278000''>equivalences. You have to
  look and see how</span> <span m=''2283000''>the basic equation was written, and
  then figure out what the</span> <span m=''2288000''>constant should be. Now, there
  was something</span> <span m=''2292000''>called, when we analyzed this before, and
  this has happened in</span> <span m=''2297000''>recitation, there was the natural,
  damped frequency.</span> </p><p><span m=''2302000''>I''ll call it the natural, damped
  frequency.</span> </p><p><span m=''2305000''>The book calls it the pseudo-frequency.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2310000''>It''s called pseudo-frequency because the function,</span>
  <span m=''2313000''>if you have zero on the right hand side, but have damping,</span>
  <span m=''2318000''>the function isn''t periodic. It decays.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2321000''>It does this. Nonetheless,</span> <span m=''2323000''>it still crosses
  the t-axis at regular intervals,</span> <span m=''2327000''>and therefore, almost
  everybody just casually</span> <span m=''2330000''>refers to it as the frequency,
  and understands it''s the</span> <span m=''2334000''>natural damped frequency. Now,
  the relation between them</span> <span m=''2339000''>is given by the little picture
  I drew you once.</span> </p><p><span m=''2342000''>But, I didn''t emphasize it enough.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2347000''>Here is omega nought.</span> </p><p><span m=''2349000''>Here
  is the right angle. The side is omega one,</span> <span m=''2352000''>and this side
  is the damping.</span> </p><p><span m=''2355000''>So, in other words, this is fixed
  because it''s</span> <span m=''2359000''>fixed by the spring. That''s the natural
  frequency of</span> <span m=''2363000''>the spring, by itself. If you are damping
  near the</span> <span m=''2367000''>motion, then the more you damped it, the bigger
  this side gets,</span> <span m=''2371000''>and therefore the smaller omega one is,
  the bigger the damping,</span> <span m=''2376000''>then the smaller the frequency
  with which the damped thing</span> <span m=''2380000''>vibrates. That sort of intuitive,</span>
  <span m=''2384000''>and vice versa. If you decrease the damping to</span> <span
  m=''2387000''>almost zero, well, then you''ll make omega one</span> <span m=''2389000''>almost
  the same size as omega zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''2391000''>This must be a right
  angle, and therefore,</span> <span m=''2394000''>if there''s very little damping,
  the natural damped frequency</span> <span m=''2397000''>will be almost the same
  as the original frequency,</span> <span m=''2400000''>the natural frequency. So,
  the relation between them</span> <span m=''2405000''>is that omega one squared is
  equal to omega nought squared</span> <span m=''2411000''>minus p squared,</span>
  <span m=''2415000''>and this comes from the characteristic roots from the</span>
  <span m=''2420000''>characteristic roots of the damped equation.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2426000''>So, we did that before. I''m just reminding you of it.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2431000''>Now, the third frequency which now enters, and that I''m asking</span>
  <span m=''2437000''>you about on the problem set is if you''ve got a damped spring,</span>
  <span m=''2443000''>okay, what happens when you impose a motion on it with yet a</span>
  <span m=''2449000''>third frequency? In other words,</span> <span m=''2453000''>drive
  the damped spring. I don''t care.</span> </p><p><span m=''2456000''>I switched to
  y, since I''m in y mode.</span> </p><p><span m=''2462000''>So, our equation looks
  like this, just as it did before,</span> <span m=''2466000''>except now going to
  drive that with an undetermined frequency,</span> <span m=''2470000''>cosine omega
  t.</span> </p><p><span m=''2473000''>And, my question, now, is, see,</span> <span
  m=''2475000''>it''s not going to be able to resonate in the correct-- you</span>
  <span m=''2479000''>really only get true resonance when you don''t have damping.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2484000''>That''s the only time where the amplitude can build up</span>
  <span m=''2487000''>indefinitely. But nonetheless,</span> <span m=''2491000''>for
  all practical purposes, and there''s always some damping</span> <span m=''2497000''>unless
  you are a perfect vacuum or something,</span> <span m=''2502000''>there''s almost
  always some damping.</span> </p><p><span m=''2506000''>So, p isn''t zero, can''t
  be exactly zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''2510000''>So, the problem is, which omega
  gives,</span> <span m=''2514000''>which frequency in the input, which input frequency
  gives the</span> <span m=''2520000''>maximal amplitude for the response?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2540000''>We solved that problem when it was undamped,</span> <span
  m=''2542000''>and the answer was easy. Omega should equal omega zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2546000''>But, when it''s damped, the answer is different.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2550000''>And, I''m not asking you to do it in general.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2553000''>I''m giving you some numbers. But nonetheless,</span> <span m=''2557000''>it
  still must be the case. So, I''m giving you,</span> <span m=''2560000''>I give you
  specific values of p and omega zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''2565000''>That''s on
  the problem set. Of course, one of them is tied</span> <span m=''2570000''>to your
  recitation. But, the answer is,</span> <span m=''2573000''>I''m going to give you
  the general formula for the answer</span> <span m=''2578000''>to make sure that
  you don''t get wildly astray.</span> </p><p><span m=''2583000''>Let''s call that
  omega r,</span> <span m=''2585000''>the resonant omega. This isn''t true resonance.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2589000''>Your book calls it practical resonance.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2591000''>Again, most people just call it resonance.</span> </p><p><span m=''2595000''>So,
  you know what I mean, type of thing.</span> </p><p><span m=''2598000''>It is omega
  r is very much like that.</span> </p><p><span m=''2600000''>Maybe I should have
  written this one down in the same form.</span> </p><p><span m=''2605000''>Omega
  one is the square root of omega nought squared minus p</span> <span m=''2609000''>squared.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2614000''>What would you expect? Well, what I would expect is</span>
  <span m=''2617000''>that omega r should be omega one.</span> </p><p><span m=''2620000''>The
  damped system has a natural frequency.</span> </p><p><span m=''2623000''>The resonant
  frequency should be the same as that natural</span> <span m=''2627000''>frequency
  with which the damped system wants to do its thing.</span> </p><p><span m=''2632000''>And
  the answer is, that''s not right.</span> </p><p><span m=''2634000''>It is the square
  root. It''s a little lower.</span> </p><p><span m=''2637000''>It''s a little lower.
  It is omega nought squared</span> <span m=''2641000''>minus two p squared.</span>
