transcript: <p><span m='8000'>First of all, the way a nonlinear autonomous</span>
  <span m='11000'>system looks, you have had some practice with</span> <span m='15000'>it
  by now. This is nonlinear.</span> </p><p><span m='17000'>The right-hand side are
  no longer simple combinations ax</span> <span m='22000'>plus by. Nonlinear and autonomous,</span>
  <span m='26000'>these are function just of x and y.</span> </p><p><span m='30000'>There
  is no t on the right-hand side.</span> </p><p><span m='33000'>Now, most of today
  will be geometric.</span> </p><p><span m='37000'>The way to get a geometric picture
  of that is first by</span> <span m='43000'>constructing the velocity field whose
  components are the</span> <span m='48000'>functions f and g. This is a velocity
  field that</span> <span m='53000'>gives a picture of the system and has solutions.</span>
  </p><p><span m='60000'>The solutions to the system, from the point of view of</span>
  <span m='65000'>functions, they would look like pairs of functions,</span> <span
  m='69000'>x of t, y of t.</span> </p><p><span m='72000'>But, from the point of view
  of geometry, when you plot them as</span> <span m='78000'>parametric equations,
  they are called trajectories of</span> <span m='83000'>the field F, which simply
  means that they are curves everywhere</span> <span m='89000'>having the right velocity.
  So a typical curve would look</span> <span m='94000'>like -- There is a trajectory.</span>
  </p><p><span m='98000'>And we know it is a trajectory because at each point the
  vector</span> <span m='102000'>on it has, of course, the right direction,</span>
  <span m='105000'>the tangent direction, but more than that,</span> <span m='108000'>it
  has the right velocity. So here, for example,</span> <span m='111000'>the point
  is traveling more slowly.</span> </p><p><span m='113000'>Here it is traveling more
  rapidly because the velocity</span> <span m='117000'>vector is bigger, longer.</span>
  </p><p><span m='120000'>So this is a picture of a typical trajectory.</span> </p><p><span
  m='123000'>The only other things that I should mention are the critical</span> <span
  m='129000'>points. If you have worked the problems</span> <span m='132000'>for this
  week, the first couple of problems,</span> <span m='136000'>you have already seen
  the significance of the critical</span> <span m='141000'>points. Well, from Monday's
  lecture you</span> <span m='144000'>know from the point of view of solutions they
  are constant</span> <span m='149000'>solutions.</span> </p><p><span m='157000'>From
  the point of view of the field they are where the field</span> <span m='161000'>is
  zero. There is no velocity vector,</span> <span m='163000'>in other words. The velocity
  vector is zero.</span> </p><p><span m='166000'>And, therefore, a point being there
  has no</span> <span m='169000'>reason to go anywhere else. And, spelling it out,</span>
  <span m='173000'>it's where the partial derivatives, where the values of</span>
  <span m='177000'>the functions on the right-hand side, which give the two</span>
  <span m='181000'>components, the i and j components of the field,</span> <span m='184000'>where
  they are zero.</span> </p><p><span m='191000'>That is all I will need by way of
  a recall today.</span> </p><p><span m='194000'>I don't think I will need anything
  else.</span> </p><p><span m='197000'>The topic for today is another kind of behavior
  that you have</span> <span m='202000'>not yet observed at the computer screen, unless
  you have worked</span> <span m='206000'>ahead, and that is there are trajectories
  which go along to</span> <span m='211000'>infinity or end up at a critical point.</span>
  </p><p><span m='215000'>They are the critical points that just sit there all the</span>
  <span m='219000'>time. But there is a third type of</span> <span m='222000'>behavior
  that a trajectory can have where it neither sits for</span> <span m='227000'>all
  time nor goes off for all time.</span> </p><p><span m='230000'>Instead, it repeats
  itself. Such a thing is called a closed</span> <span m='235000'>trajectory. What
  does it look like?</span> </p><p><span m='239000'>Well, it is a closed curve in
  the plane that at every point,</span> <span m='245000'>it is a trajectory, i.e.,
  the arrows at each point,</span> <span m='250000'>let's say it is traced in the
  clockwise direction.</span> </p><p><span m='255000'>And so the arrows of the field
  will go like this.</span> </p><p><span m='260000'>Here it is going slowly, here
  it is very slow and here</span> <span m='265000'>it picks up a little speed again
  and so on.</span> </p><p><span m='271000'>Now, for such a trajectory what is happening?</span>
  </p><p><span m='275000'>Well, it goes around in finite time and then repeats itself.</span>
  </p><p><span m='282000'>It just goes round and round forever if you land on that</span>
  <span m='288000'>trajectory. It represents a system that</span> <span m='293000'>returns
  to its original state periodically.</span> </p><p><span m='297000'>It represents
  periodic behavior of the system.</span> </p><p><span m='316000'>Now, we have seen
  one example of that, a simple example where</span> <span m='323000'>this simple
  system, x prime equals y,</span> <span m='329000'>y prime equals negative x.</span>
  </p><p><span m='340000'>We could write down the solutions to that directly,</span>
  <span m='343000'>but if you want to do eigenvalues and eigenvectors the</span> <span
  m='347000'>matrix will look like this. The equation will be lambda</span> <span
  m='351000'>squared plus zero lambda plus one equals zero,</span> <span m='355000'>so
  the eigenvalues will be plus</span> <span m='358000'>or minus i. In fact, from then
  on you could</span> <span m='362000'>work out in the usual ways the eigenvectors,</span>
  <span m='364000'>complex eigenvectors and separate them.</span> </p><p><span m='367000'>But,
  look, you can avoid all that just by writing down the</span> <span m='371000'>solution.
  The solutions are sines and</span> <span m='373000'>cosines. One basic solution
  will be x</span> <span m='376000'>equals cosine t, in which case what is y?</span>
  </p><p><span m='379000'>Well, y is the derivative of that.</span> </p><p><span m='382000'>That
  will be minus sine t.</span> </p><p><span m='384000'>Another basic solution, we
  will start with x equals</span> <span m='388000'>sine t. In which case y will be
  cosine</span> <span m='393000'>t, its derivative.</span> </p><p><span m='396000'>Now,
  if you do that, what do these things look like?</span> </p><p><span m='401000'>Well,
  either of these two basic solutions looks like a circle,</span> <span m='407000'>not
  traced in the usual way but in the opposite way.</span> </p><p><span m='412000'>For
  example, when t is equal to zero it</span> <span m='416000'>starts at the point
  one, zero.</span> </p><p><span m='420000'>Now, if the minus sign were not there
  this would be x equals</span> <span m='424000'>cosine t, y equals sine t,</span>
  <span m='428000'>which is the usual counterclockwise circle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='431000'>But if I change y from sine t to negative sine t</span> <span m='435000'>it
  is going around the other way.</span> </p><p><span m='438000'>So this circle is
  traced that way.</span> </p><p><span m='440000'>And this is a family of circles,
  according to the values</span> <span m='444000'>of c1 and c2, concentric, all of
  which go</span> <span m='447000'>around clockwise. So those are closed</span> <span
  m='451000'>trajectories. Those are the solutions.</span> </p><p><span m='453000'>They
  are trajectories of the vector field.</span> </p><p><span m='456000'>They are closed.
  They come around and they</span> <span m='459000'>repeat in finite time. Now, these
  are no good.</span> </p><p><span m='462000'>These are the kind I am not interested
  in.</span> </p><p><span m='465000'>These are commonplace, and we are interested
  in good</span> <span m='469000'>stuff today. And the good stuff we are</span> <span
  m='471000'>interested in is limit cycles.</span> </p><p><span m='481000'>A limit
  cycle is a closed trajectory with a couple of</span> <span m='486000'>extra hypotheses.
  It is a closed trajectory,</span> <span m='490000'>just like those guys, but it
  has something they don't</span> <span m='495000'>have, namely, it is king of the
  roost.</span> </p><p><span m='499000'>They have to be isolated, no other guys nearby.</span>
  </p><p><span m='503000'>And they also have to be stable.</span> </p><p><span m='507000'>See,
  the problem here is that none of these stands out from</span> <span m='512000'>any
  of the others. In other words,</span> <span m='517000'>there must be, isolated means,</span>
  <span m='520000'>no others nearby.</span> </p><p><span m='529000'>That is just what
  goes wrong here.</span> </p><p><span m='531000'>Arbitrarily close to each of these
  circles is yet another</span> <span m='535000'>circle doing exactly the same thing.</span>
  </p><p><span m='538000'>That means that there are some that are only of mild interest.</span>
  </p><p><span m='543000'>What is much more interesting is to find a cycle where there</span>
  <span m='547000'>is nothing nearby. Something, therefore,</span> <span m='550000'>that
  looks like this.</span> </p><p><span m='562000'>Here is our pink guy. Let's make
  this one go</span> <span m='565000'>counterclockwise. Here is a limit cycle,</span>
  <span m='568000'>it seems to be. And now what do nearby guys do?</span> </p><p><span
  m='573000'>Well, they should approach it. Somebody here like that does</span> <span
  m='578000'>this, spirals in and gets ever and every closer to that thing.</span>
  </p><p><span m='584000'>Now, it can never join it because, if it joined it at the</span>
  <span m='590000'>joining point, I would have two solutions</span> <span m='594000'>going
  through this point. And that is illegal.</span> </p><p><span m='600000'>All it can
  do is get arbitrarily close.</span> </p><p><span m='602000'>On the computer screen
  it will look as if it joins it but,</span> <span m='606000'>of course, it cannot.
  It is just the resolution,</span> <span m='610000'>the pixels. Not enough pixels.</span>
  </p><p><span m='612000'>The resolution isn't good enough.</span> </p><p><span m='614000'>And
  the ones that start further away will take longer to find</span> <span m='618000'>their
  way to the limit cycle and they will always stay outside of</span> <span m='623000'>the
  earlier guys, but they will get arbitrarily</span> <span m='626000'>close, too.
  How about inside?</span> </p><p><span m='630000'>Inside, well, it starts somewhere
  and does</span> <span m='633000'>the same thing. It starts here and will try to</span>
  <span m='637000'>join the limit cycle. That is what I mean by</span> <span m='641000'>stability.
  Stability means that nearby</span> <span m='644000'>guys, the guys that start somewhere
  else eventually</span> <span m='648000'>approach the limit cycle, regardless of
  whether they</span> <span m='652000'>start from the outside or start from the inside.</span>
  </p><p><span m='656000'>So that is stable. An unstable limit cycle --</span> <span
  m='662000'>But I am not calling it a limit cycle if it is unstable.</span> </p><p><span
  m='666000'>I am just calling it a closed trajectory, but let's draw one</span> <span
  m='670000'>which is unstable. Here is the way we will look if</span> <span m='674000'>it
  is unstable. Guys that start nearby will be</span> <span m='677000'>repelled, driven
  somewhere else. Or, if they start here,</span> <span m='681000'>they will go away
  from the thing instead of going toward</span> <span m='685000'>it. This is unstable.</span>
  </p><p><span m='687000'>And I don't call it a limit cycle.</span> </p><p><span m='689000'>It
  is just a closed trajectory.</span> </p><p><span m='698000'>Cycle because it cycles
  round and round.</span> </p><p><span m='700000'>Limit because it is the limit of
  the nearby curves.</span> </p><p><span m='704000'>The other case where it is unstable
  is not the limit.</span> </p><p><span m='708000'>Of course, you could have a case
  also where the curves</span> <span m='712000'>outside spiral in toward it but the
  ones inside are repelled and</span> <span m='717000'>do this. That would be called</span>
  <span m='719000'>semi-stable. And you can make up all sorts</span> <span m='723000'>of
  cases. And I think I,</span> <span m='725000'>at one point, drew them in the notes,</span>
  <span m='727000'>but I am not going to. The only interesting one,</span> <span m='731000'>of
  permanent importance that people study,</span> <span m='734000'>are the actual limit
  cycles. No, it was the stable closed</span> <span m='739000'>trajectories. Notice,
  by the way,</span> <span m='741000'>a closed trajectory is always a simple curve.</span>
  </p><p><span m='745000'>Remember what that means from 18.02?</span> </p><p><span
  m='749000'>Simple means it doesn't cross itself.</span> </p><p><span m='752000'>Why
  doesn't it cross itself? It cannot cross itself because,</span> <span m='757000'>if
  it tried to, what is wrong with that point?</span> </p><p><span m='761000'>At that
  point which way does the vector field go,</span> <span m='766000'>that way or that
  way? Why the interest of limit</span> <span m='770000'>cycles? Well, because there
  are systems</span> <span m='774000'>in nature in which just this type of behavior,</span>
  <span m='778000'>they have a certain periodic motion.</span> </p><p><span m='783000'>And,
  if you disturb it, gradually it returns to its</span> <span m='787000'>original
  periodic state. A simple example is breathing.</span> </p><p><span m='791000'>Now
  I have made you all self-conscious.</span> </p><p><span m='794000'>All of you are
  breathing. If you are here you are</span> <span m='798000'>breathing. At what rate
  are you breathing?</span> </p><p><span m='802000'>Well, you are unaware of it, of
  course, except now.</span> </p><p><span m='806000'>If you are sitting here listening.</span>
  </p><p><span m='810000'>There is a certain temperature and a certain air circulation
  in</span> <span m='814000'>the room. You are not thinking of</span> <span m='816000'>anything,
  certainly not of the lecture, and the lecture is not</span> <span m='820000'>unduly
  exciting, you will breathe at a certain</span> <span m='823000'>steady rate which
  is a little different for every person but</span> <span m='827000'>that is your
  rate. Now, you can artificially</span> <span m='830000'>change that. You could say
  now I am going to</span> <span m='833000'>breathe faster. And indeed you can.</span>
  </p><p><span m='837000'>But, as soon as you stop being aware of what you are doing,</span>
  <span m='841000'>the levels of various hormones and carbon dioxide in your</span>
  <span m='846000'>bloodstream and so on will return your breathing to its</span>
  <span m='851000'>natural state. In other words,</span> <span m='853000'>that system
  of your breathing, which is controlled by various</span> <span m='858000'>chemicals
  and hormones in the body, is exhibiting exactly this</span> <span m='863000'>type
  of behavior. It has a certain regular</span> <span m='867000'>periodic motion as
  a system. And, if disturbed,</span> <span m='872000'>if artificially you set it
  out somewhere else,</span> <span m='874000'>it will gradually return to its original
  state.</span> </p><p><span m='877000'>Now, of course, if I am running it will be</span>
  <span m='880000'>different. Sure.</span> </p><p><span m='881000'>If you are running
  you breathe faster, but that is because the</span> <span m='885000'>parameters in
  the system, the a's and the b's in the</span> <span m='888000'>equation, the f of
  (x, y) and g of (x,</span> <span m='890000'>y), the parameters in those</span> <span
  m='893000'>functions will be set at different levels.</span> </p><p><span m='896000'>You
  will have different hormones, a different of carbon</span> <span m='899000'>dioxide
  and so on. Now, I am not saying that</span> <span m='904000'>breathing is modeled
  by a limit cycle.</span> </p><p><span m='907000'>It is the sort of thing which one
  might look for a limit</span> <span m='911000'>cycle. That is, of course,</span>
  <span m='913000'>a question for biologists. And, in general,</span> <span m='917000'>any
  type of periodic behavior in nature, people try to see if</span> <span m='922000'>there
  is some system of differential equations which</span> <span m='926000'>governs it
  in which perhaps there is a limit cycle,</span> <span m='930000'>which contains
  a limit cycle. Well, what are the problems?</span> </p><p><span m='936000'>In a
  sense, limit cycles are easy to lecture about because so</span> <span m='941000'>little
  is known about them. At the end of the period,</span> <span m='946000'>if I have
  time, I will show you that the</span> <span m='949000'>simplest possible question
  you could ask, the answer to it is</span> <span m='955000'>totally known after 120
  years of steady trying.</span> </p><p><span m='960000'>But let's first talk about
  what sorts of problems people address</span> <span m='965000'>with limit cycles.
  First of all is the existence</span> <span m='969000'>problem.</span> </p><p><span
  m='976000'>If I give you a system, you know, the right-hand side</span> <span m='979000'>is
  x squared plus 2y cubed minus 3xy,</span> <span m='983000'>and the g is something
  similar. I say does this have limit</span> <span m='986000'>cycles? Well, you know
  how to find its</span> <span m='989000'>critical points. But how do you find out
  if it</span> <span m='994000'>has limit cycles? The answer to that is nobody</span>
  <span m='1000000'>has any idea. This problem,</span> <span m='1004000'>in general,
  there are not much in the way of methods.</span> </p><p><span m='1010000'>Not much.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1020000'>Not much is known. There is one theorem that you</span>
  <span m='1023000'>will find in the notes, a simple theorem called the</span> <span
  m='1027000'>Poincare-Bendixson theorem which, for about 60 or 70 years</span> <span
  m='1031000'>was about the only result known which enabled people to find</span>
  <span m='1036000'>limit cycles. Nowadays the theorem is used</span> <span m='1039000'>relatively
  little because people try to find limit cycles by</span> <span m='1044000'>computer.
  Now, the difficulty is you have</span> <span m='1047000'>to know where to look for
  them. In other words,</span> <span m='1052000'>the computer screen shows that much
  and you set the axes and it</span> <span m='1056000'>doesn't show any limit cycles.
  That doesn't mean there are not</span> <span m='1060000'>any. That means they are
  over there,</span> <span m='1063000'>or it means there is a big one like there.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1066000'>And you are looking in the middle of it and don't see it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1070000'>So, in general, people don't look for limit</span> <span
  m='1073000'>cycles unless the physical system that gave rise to the</span> <span
  m='1076000'>pair of differential equations suggests that there is something</span>
  <span m='1081000'>repetitive going on like breathing.</span> </p><p><span m='1085000'>And,
  if it tells you that, then it often gives you</span> <span m='1089000'>approximate
  values of the parameters and the variables so</span> <span m='1094000'>you know
  where to look. Basically this is done by</span> <span m='1098000'>computer search
  guided by the physical problem.</span> </p><p><span m='1111000'>Therefore, I cannot
  say much more about it today.</span> </p><p><span m='1115000'>Instead I am going
  to focus my attention on nonexistence.</span> </p><p><span m='1120000'>When can
  you be sure that a system will not have any limit</span> <span m='1126000'>cycles?
  And there are two theorems.</span> </p><p><span m='1129000'>One, again, due to Bendixson
  who was a Swedish mathematician</span> <span m='1134000'>who lived around 1900 or
  so. There is a criterion due to</span> <span m='1139000'>Bendixson. And there is
  one involving</span> <span m='1144000'>critical points. And I would like to describe</span>
  <span m='1148000'>both of them for you today. First of all,</span> <span m='1151000'>Bendixson's
  criterion.</span> </p><p><span m='1162000'>It is very simply stated and has a marvelous
  proof,</span> <span m='1165000'>which I am going to give you. We have D as a region
  of the</span> <span m='1169000'>plane.</span> </p><p><span m='1175000'>And what
  Bendixson's criterion tells you to do is take your</span> <span m='1180000'>vector
  field and calculate its divergence.</span> </p><p><span m='1183000'>We are set back
  in 1802, and this proof is going to be</span> <span m='1188000'>straight 18.02.
  You will enjoy it.</span> </p><p><span m='1191000'>Calculate the divergence. Now,
  I am talking about the</span> <span m='1195000'>two-dimensional divergence. Remember
  that is fx,</span> <span m='1200000'>the partial of f with respect to x, plus the
  partial of the g,</span> <span m='1205000'>the j component with respect to y.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1208000'>And assume that that is a continuous function.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1212000'>It always will be with us. Practically all the examples I</span> <span
  m='1216000'>will give you f and g will be simple polynomials.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1220000'>They are smooth, continuous and nice and behave</span> <span m='1224000'>as
  you want. And you calculate that and</span> <span m='1227000'>assume -- Suppose,
  in other words,</span> <span m='1232000'>that the divergence of f, I need more room.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1236000'>The hypothesis is that the divergence of f is not zero
  in</span> <span m='1242000'>that region D. It is never zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1245000'>It is not zero at any point in that region.</span> </p><p><span m='1249000'>The
  conclusion is that there are no limit cycles in the</span> <span m='1255000'>region.
  If it is not zero in D,</span> <span m='1258000'>there are no limit cycles. In fact,
  there are not even any</span> <span m='1264000'>closed trajectories. You couldn't
  even have those</span> <span m='1269000'>bunch of concentric circles, so there are
  no closed</span> <span m='1273000'>trajectories of the original system whose divergence
  you</span> <span m='1278000'>calculated. There are no closed</span> <span m='1281000'>trajectories
  in D. For example,</span> <span m='1284000'>let me give you a simple example to
  put a little flesh on</span> <span m='1289000'>it. Let's see.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1292000'>What do I have? I prepared an example.</span> </p><p><span m='1295000'>x
  prime equals, here is a simple nonlinear</span> <span m='1300000'>system, x cubed
  plus y cubed.</span> </p><p><span m='1305000'>And y prime equals 3x plus y cubed
  plus 2y.</span> </p><p><span m='1319000'>Does this system have limit cycles?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1321000'>Well, even to calculate its critical points would be a</span>
  <span m='1325000'>little task, but we can easily answer the question as to</span>
  <span m='1329000'>whether it has limit cycles or not by Bendixson's criterion.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1334000'>Let's calculate the divergence. The divergence of the vector</span>
  <span m='1338000'>field whose components are these two functions is,</span> <span
  m='1342000'>well, 3x squared, it's the partial of the first</span> <span m='1346000'>guy
  with respect to x plus the partial of the second guy with</span> <span m='1351000'>respect
  to y, which is 3y squared plus two.</span> </p><p><span m='1354000'>Now, can that
  be zero anywhere</span> <span m='1359000'>in the x,y-plane? No, because it is the
  sum of</span> <span m='1363000'>these two squares. This much of it could be zero</span>
  <span m='1367000'>only at the origin, but that plus two eliminates</span> <span
  m='1371000'>even that. This is always positive in the</span> <span m='1375000'>entire
  x,y-plane. Here my domain is the whole</span> <span m='1379000'>x,y-plane and, therefore,
  the conclusion is</span> <span m='1383000'>that there are no closed trajectories
  in the x,y-plane,</span> <span m='1387000'>anywhere.</span> </p><p><span m='1395000'>And
  we have done that with just a couple of lines of calculation</span> <span m='1398000'>and
  nothing further required. No computer search.</span> </p><p><span m='1401000'>In
  fact, no computer search could ever proof this.</span> </p><p><span m='1404000'>It
  would be impossible because, no matter where you look,</span> <span m='1407000'>there
  is always some other place to look.</span> </p><p><span m='1410000'>This is an example
  where a couple lines of mathematics</span> <span m='1415000'>dispose of the matter
  far more effectively than a million</span> <span m='1421000'>dollars worth of calculation.
  Well, where does Bendixson's</span> <span m='1426000'>theorem come from? Yes, Bendixson's
  theorem comes</span> <span m='1431000'>from 18.02. And I am giving it to you both</span>
  <span m='1436000'>to recall a little bit of 18.02 to you.</span> </p><p><span m='1441000'>Because
  it is about the first example in the course that we</span> <span m='1446000'>have
  had of an indirect argument.</span> </p><p><span m='1449000'>And indirect arguments
  are something you have to slowly get</span> <span m='1454000'>used to. I am going
  to give you an</span> <span m='1457000'>indirect proof. Remember what that is?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1460000'>You assume the contrary and you show it leads to a</span>
  <span m='1465000'>contradiction. What would assuming the</span> <span m='1468000'>contrary
  be? Contrary would be I will assume</span> <span m='1474000'>the divergence is not
  zero, but I will suppose there is a</span> <span m='1480000'>closed trajectory.
  Suppose there is a closed</span> <span m='1484000'>trajectory that exists.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1496000'>Let's draw a picture of it.</span> </p><p><span m='1508000'>And
  let's say it goes around this way.</span> </p><p><span m='1511000'>There is a closed
  trajectory for our system.</span> </p><p><span m='1515000'>Let's call the curve
  C. And I am going to call the</span> <span m='1519000'>inside of it R, the way one
  often does in</span> <span m='1522000'>18.02. D is all this region out here,</span>
  <span m='1525000'>in which everything is taking place.</span> </p><p><span m='1530000'>This
  is to exist in D. Now, what I am going to do is</span> <span m='1535000'>calculate
  a line integral around that curve.</span> </p><p><span m='1545000'>A line integral
  of this vector field.</span> </p><p><span m='1547000'>Now, there are two things
  you can calculate.</span> </p><p><span m='1551000'>One of the line integrals, I
  will put in a few of the</span> <span m='1555000'>vectors here. The vectors I know
  are pointing</span> <span m='1558000'>this way because that is the direction in
  which the curve is</span> <span m='1563000'>being traversed in order to make it
  a trajectory.</span> </p><p><span m='1568000'>Those are a few of the typical vectors
  in the field.</span> </p><p><span m='1572000'>I am going to calculate the line integral
  around that curve</span> <span m='1576000'>in the positive sense. In other words,</span>
  <span m='1579000'>not in the direction of the salmon-colored arrow,</span> <span
  m='1583000'>but in the normal sense in which you calculate it using</span> <span
  m='1587000'>Green's theorem, for example.</span> </p><p><span m='1591000'>The positive
  sense means the one which keeps the region,</span> <span m='1594000'>the inside
  on your left, as you walk around like that</span> <span m='1598000'>the region stays
  on your left. That is the positive sense.</span> </p><p><span m='1602000'>That is
  the sense in which I am integrating.</span> </p><p><span m='1605000'>I am going
  to use Green's theorem, but the integral that I</span> <span m='1609000'>am going
  to calculate is not the work integral.</span> </p><p><span m='1612000'>I am going
  to calculate instead the flux integral,</span> <span m='1615000'>the integral that
  represents the flux of F across C.</span> </p><p><span m='1620000'>Now, what is
  that integral? Well, at each point,</span> <span m='1624000'>you station a little
  ant and the ant reports the outward flow</span> <span m='1629000'>rate across that
  point which is F dotted with the normal vector.</span> </p><p><span m='1635000'>I
  will put in a few normal vectors just to remind you.</span> </p><p><span m='1640000'>The
  normal vectors look like little unit vectors pointing</span> <span m='1645000'>perpendicularly
  outwards everywhere.</span> </p><p><span m='1649000'>These are the n's. F dotted
  with the unit normal</span> <span m='1654000'>vector, and that is added up around
  the curve.</span> </p><p><span m='1658000'>This quantity gives me the flux of the
  field across C.</span> </p><p><span m='1663000'>Now, we are going to calculate that
  by Green's theorem.</span> </p><p><span m='1668000'>But, before we calculate it
  by Green's theorem,</span> <span m='1672000'>we are going to psych it out. What
  is it?</span> </p><p><span m='1675000'>What is the value of that integral?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1680000'>Well, since I am asking you to do it in your head there
  can</span> <span m='1684000'>only be one possible answer. It is zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1686000'>Why is that integral zero? Well, because at each point the</span> <span
  m='1690000'>field vector, the velocity vector is</span> <span m='1693000'>perpendicular
  to the normal vector.</span> </p><p><span m='1695000'>Why? The normal vector points</span>
  <span m='1697000'>perpendicularly to the curve but the field vector always is</span>
  <span m='1702000'>tangent to the curve because this curve is a trajectory.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1707000'>It is always supposed to be going in the direction given
  by</span> <span m='1714000'>that white field vector. Do you follow?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1719000'>A trajectory means that it is always tangent to the field</span> <span
  m='1727000'>vector and, therefore, always perpendicular to the</span> <span m='1733000'>normal
  vector. This is zero since F dot n is</span> <span m='1739000'>always zero. Everywhere
  on the curve,</span> <span m='1743000'>F dot n has to be zero. There is no flux
  of this field</span> <span m='1747000'>across the curve because the field is always
  in the same</span> <span m='1752000'>direction as the curve, never perpendicular
  to it.</span> </p><p><span m='1755000'>It has no components perpendicular to it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1759000'>Good. Now let's do it the hard way.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1761000'>Let's use Green's theorem. Green's theorem says that the</span> <span
  m='1765000'>flux across C should be equal to the double integral over that</span>
  <span m='1770000'>region of the divergence of F. It's like Gauss theorem in two</span>
  <span m='1775000'>dimensions, this version of it. Divergence of F,</span> <span
  m='1779000'>that is a function, I double integrate it over the</span> <span m='1782000'>region,
  and then that is dx / dy, or let's say da because you</span> <span m='1786000'>might
  want to do it in polar coordinates.</span> </p><p><span m='1788000'>And, on the
  problem set, you certainly will want to do</span> <span m='1792000'>it in polar
  coordinates, I think.</span> </p><p><span m='1800000'>All right. How much is that?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1802000'>Well, we haven't yet used the hypothesis.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1806000'>All we have done is set up the problem.</span> </p><p><span m='1810000'>Now,
  the hypothesis was that the divergence is never zero</span> <span m='1816000'>anywhere
  in D. Therefore, the divergence is</span> <span m='1820000'>never zero anywhere
  in R. What I say is the divergence is</span> <span m='1826000'>either greater than
  zero everywhere in R.</span> </p><p><span m='1832000'>Or less than zero everywhere
  in R.</span> </p><p><span m='1835000'>But it cannot be sometimes positive and sometimes
  negative.</span> </p><p><span m='1840000'>Why not? In other words,</span> <span
  m='1842000'>I say it is not possible the divergence here is one and here</span>
  <span m='1847000'>is minus two. That is not possible because,</span> <span m='1851000'>if
  I drew a line from this point to that,</span> <span m='1855000'>along that line
  the divergence would start positive and end up</span> <span m='1860000'>negative.
  And, therefore,</span> <span m='1864000'>have to be zero some time in between.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1866000'>It's because it is a continuous function.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1869000'>It is a continuous function. I am assuming that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1872000'>And, therefore, if it sometimes positive and</span> <span m='1875000'>sometimes
  negative it has to be zero in between.</span> </p><p><span m='1878000'>You cannot
  get continuously from plus one to minus two</span> <span m='1882000'>without passing
  through zero. The reason for this is,</span> <span m='1887000'>since the divergence
  is never zero in R it therefore must</span> <span m='1895000'>always stay positive
  or always stay negative.</span> </p><p><span m='1900000'>Now, if it always stays
  positive, the conclusion is then</span> <span m='1907000'>this double integral must
  be positive.</span> </p><p><span m='1912000'>Therefore, this double integral is
  either greater than zero.</span> </p><p><span m='1921000'>That is if the divergence
  is always positive.</span> </p><p><span m='1924000'>Or, it is less than zero if
  the divergence is always negative.</span> </p><p><span m='1930000'>But the one thing
  it cannot be is not zero.</span> </p><p><span m='1934000'>Well, the left-hand side,
  Green's theorem is supposed to</span> <span m='1938000'>be true. Green's theorem
  is our bedrock.</span> </p><p><span m='1942000'>18.02 would crumble without that
  so it must be true.</span> </p><p><span m='1946000'>One way of calculating the left-hand
  side gives us zero.</span> </p><p><span m='1953000'>If we calculate the right-hand
  side it is not zero.</span> </p><p><span m='1956000'>That is called the contradiction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1958000'>Where did the contradiction arise from?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1961000'>It arose from the fact that I supposed that there was a closed</span>
  <span m='1965000'>trajectory in that region. The conclusion is there cannot</span>
  <span m='1968000'>be any closed trajectory of that region because it leads to a</span>
  <span m='1972000'>contradiction via Green's theorem.</span> </p><p><span m='1982000'>Let
  me see if I can give you some of the argument for the</span> <span m='1986000'>other,
  well, let's at least state the other criterion I</span> <span m='1990000'>wanted
  to give you.</span> </p><p><span m='2001000'>Suppose, for example, we use this system,</span>
  <span m='2005000'>x prime equals --</span> <span m='2030000'>Does this have limit
  cycles?</span> </p><p><span m='2039000'>Does that have limit cycles?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2048000'>Let's Bendixson it. We will calculate the</span> <span m='2052000'>divergence
  of a vector field. It is 2x from the top function.</span> </p><p><span m='2058000'>The
  partial with respect to x is 2x.</span> </p><p><span m='2062000'>The second function
  with respect to y is negative 2y.</span> </p><p><span m='2069000'>That certainly
  could be zero. In fact, this is zero along the</span> <span m='2074000'>entire line
  x equals y. Its divergence is zero here</span> <span m='2079000'>along that whole
  line. The best I could conclude was,</span> <span m='2084000'>I could conclude that
  there is no limit cycle like this and</span> <span m='2090000'>there is no limit
  cycle like this, but there is nothing so</span> <span m='2095000'>far that says
  a limit cycle could not cross that because</span> <span m='2100000'>that would not
  violate Bendixson's theorem.</span> </p><p><span m='2106000'>In other words, any
  domain that contained part</span> <span m='2109000'>of this line, the divergence
  would be zero</span> <span m='2113000'>along that line. And, therefore,</span> <span
  m='2115000'>I could conclude nothing. I could have limit cycles that</span> <span
  m='2120000'>cross that line, as long as they included a</span> <span m='2123000'>piece
  of that line in them. The answer is I cannot make a</span> <span m='2128000'>conclusion.
  Well, that is because I am</span> <span m='2132000'>using the wrong criterion. Let's
  instead use the critical</span> <span m='2136000'>point criterion.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2155000'>Now, I am going to say that it makes a nice positive statement</span>
  <span m='2158000'>but nobody ever uses it this way.</span> </p><p><span m='2161000'>Nonetheless,
  let's first state it</span> <span m='2163000'>positively, even though that is not
  the way to use it.</span> </p><p><span m='2167000'>The positive statement will be,
  once again, we have our region</span> <span m='2173000'>D and we have a region of
  the xy plane and we have our C,</span> <span m='2180000'>a closed trajectory in
  it. A closed trajectory of what?</span> </p><p><span m='2186000'>Of our system.
  And that is supposed to be in</span> <span m='2190000'>D. The critical point criterion</span>
  <span m='2195000'>says something very simple. If you have that situation it</span>
  <span m='2202000'>says that inside that closed trajectory there must be a</span>
  <span m='2208000'>critical point somewhere.</span> </p><p><span m='2220000'>It says
  that inside C is a critical point.</span> </p><p><span m='2235000'>Now, this won't
  help us with the existence problem.</span> </p><p><span m='2238000'>This won't help
  us find a closed trajectory.</span> </p><p><span m='2241000'>We will take our system
  and say it has a critical point here and</span> <span m='2246000'>a critical point
  there. Does it have a closed</span> <span m='2249000'>trajectory? Well, all I know
  is the closed</span> <span m='2253000'>trajectory, if it exists, will have to go
  around one or</span> <span m='2256000'>more of those critical points. But I don't
  know where.</span> </p><p><span m='2260000'>It is not going to go around it like
  this.</span> </p><p><span m='2263000'>It might go around it like this.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2265000'>And my computer search won't find it because it is looking at</span>
  <span m='2269000'>too small a part of the screen. It doesn't work that way.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2273000'>It works negatively by contraposition.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2276000'>Do you know what the contrapositive is?</span> </p><p><span m='2280000'>You
  will at least learn that. A implies B says the same thing</span> <span m='2287000'>as
  not B implies not A.</span> </p><p><span m='2300000'>They are different statements
  but they are equivalent to each</span> <span m='2304000'>other. If you prove one
  you prove the</span> <span m='2307000'>other. What would be the</span> <span m='2309000'>contrapositive
  here? If you have a closed trajectory</span> <span m='2315000'>inside is a critical
  point. The theorem is used this way.</span> </p><p><span m='2324000'>If D has no
  critical points, it has no closed trajectories</span> <span m='2333000'>and therefore
  has no limit cycle.</span> </p><p><span m='2340000'>Because, if it did have a closed
  trajectory,</span> <span m='2343000'>inside it would be a critical point.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2347000'>But I said B had no critical point.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2350000'>That enables us to dispose of this system that Bendixson could</span>
  <span m='2355000'>not handle at all. We can dispose of this system</span> <span
  m='2360000'>immediately. Namely, what is it?</span> </p><p><span m='2362000'>Where
  are its critical points? Well, where is that zero?</span> </p><p><span m='2369000'>x
  squared plus y squared is one,</span> <span m='2372000'>plus one is never zero.
  This is positive.</span> </p><p><span m='2375000'>Or, worse, zero. And then I add
  the one to it</span> <span m='2378000'>and it is not zero anymore. This has no zeros
  and,</span> <span m='2382000'>therefore, it does not matter that this one has a
  lot of</span> <span m='2386000'>zeros. It makes no difference.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2388000'>It has no critical points. It has none,</span> <span m='2391000'>therefore,
  no limit cycles.</span> </p><p><span m='2401000'>Now, I desperately wanted to give
  you the proof of this.</span> </p><p><span m='2404000'>It is clearly impossible
  in the time remaining.</span> </p><p><span m='2407000'>The proof requires a little
  time.</span> </p><p><span m='2409000'>I haven't decided what to do about that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2412000'>It might leak over until Friday's lecture.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2415000'>Instead, I will finish by telling you a story.</span> </p><p><span m='2418000'>How
  is that?</span> </p><p><span m='2437000'>And along side of it was little y prime.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2439000'>I am not going to continue on with the letters of the</span>
  <span m='2443000'>alphabet. I will prime the earlier one.</span> </p><p><span m='2446000'>This
  has a total of 12 parameters in it.</span> </p><p><span m='2449000'>But, in fact,
  if you change variables you can</span> <span m='2452000'>get rid of all the linear
  terms. The important part of it is</span> <span m='2457000'>only the quadratic terms
  in the beginning.</span> </p><p><span m='2461000'>This sort of thing is called a
  quadratic system.</span> </p><p><span m='2465000'>After you have departed from linear
  systems,</span> <span m='2469000'>it is the simplest kind there is.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2472000'>And the predictor-prey, the robin-earthworm example I</span> <span m='2476000'>gave
  you is of a typical quadratic system and exhibits</span> <span m='2481000'>typical
  nonlinear quadratic system behavior.</span> </p><p><span m='2485000'>Now, the problem
  is the following.</span> </p><p><span m='2490000'>A, b, c, d, e, f and so on,</span>
  <span m='2492000'>those are just real numbers, parameters, so I am allowed to</span>
  <span m='2497000'>give them any values I want. And the problem that has</span> <span
  m='2502000'>bothered people since 1880 when it was first proposed is how</span>
  <span m='2507000'>many limit cycles can a quadratic system have?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2523000'>After 120 years this problem is totally unsolved,</span> <span m='2527000'>and
  the mathematicians of the world who are interested in it</span> <span m='2532000'>cannot
  even agree with each other on what the right</span> <span m='2536000'>conjecture
  is. But let me tell you a little</span> <span m='2540000'>bit of its history. There
  were attempts to solve it</span> <span m='2544000'>in the 20 or 30 years after it
  was first proposed,</span> <span m='2548000'>through the 1920 and `30s which all
  seemed to have gaps in them.</span> </p><p><span m='2555000'>Until finally around
  1950 two Russians mathematicians,</span> <span m='2559000'>one of whom is extremely
  well-known, Petrovski,</span> <span m='2564000'>a specialist in systems of ordinary
  differential equations</span> <span m='2569000'>published a long and difficult,
  complicated 100 page paper in</span> <span m='2574000'>which they proved that the
  maximum number is three.</span> </p><p><span m='2580000'>I won't put down their
  names. Petrovski-Landis.</span> </p><p><span m='2583000'>The maximum number was
  three. And then not many people were</span> <span m='2588000'>able to read the paper,
  and those who did there seemed</span> <span m='2592000'>to be gaps in the reasoning
  in various places until finally</span> <span m='2596000'>Arnold who was the greatest
  Russian, in my opinion,</span> <span m='2600000'>one of the greatest Russian mathematician,</span>
  <span m='2603000'>certainly in this field of analysis and differential</span> <span
  m='2607000'>equations, but in other fields, too, he still is great,</span> <span
  m='2611000'>although he is somewhat older now, criticized it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2617000'>He said look, there is a really big gap in</span> <span m='2621000'>this
  argument and it really cannot be considered to be</span> <span m='2626000'>proven.
  People tried working very hard</span> <span m='2630000'>to patch it up and without
  success.</span> </p><p><span m='2633000'>Then about 1972 or so, '75 maybe, a Chinese</span>
  <span m='2638000'>mathematician found a system with four.</span> </p><p><span m='2643000'>Wrote
  down the numbers, the number a is so much,</span> <span m='2647000'>b is so much,
  and they were absurd numbers</span> <span m='2651000'>like 10^-6 and 40 billion
  and so on, nothing you could plot on a</span> <span m='2657000'>computer screen,
  but found a system with four.</span> </p><p><span m='2662000'>Nobody after this
  tried to fill in the gap in the</span> <span m='2666000'>Petrovski-Landis paper.
  I was then chairman of the math</span> <span m='2672000'>department, and one of
  my tasks was protocol and so on.</span> </p><p><span m='2676000'>Anyway, we were
  trying very hard to attract a Chinese</span> <span m='2680000'>mathematician to
  our department to become a full professor.</span> </p><p><span m='2684000'>He was
  a really outstanding analyst and specialist in</span> <span m='2688000'>various
  fields. Anyway, he came in for a</span> <span m='2690000'>courtesy interview and
  we chatted.</span> </p><p><span m='2693000'>At the time, I was very much interested
  in</span> <span m='2696000'>limit cycles. And I had on my desk the Math</span> <span
  m='2699000'>Society's translation of the Chinese book on limit cycles.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2705000'>A collection of papers by Chinese mathematicians all on</span> <span
  m='2708000'>limit cycles. After a certain point he said,</span> <span m='2711000'>oh,
  I see you're interested in limit cycle problems.</span> </p><p><span m='2715000'>I
  said yeah, in particular,</span> <span m='2716000'>I was reading this paper of the
  mathematician who found four</span> <span m='2720000'>limit cycles. And I opened
  to that system and</span> <span m='2723000'>said the name is, and I read it out
  loud.</span> </p><p><span m='2726000'>I said do you by any chance know him?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2730000'>And he smiled and said yes, very well.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2732000'>That is my mother. [LAUGHTER]</span> <span m='2743000'>Well, bye-bye.</span>
