transcript: '<p><span m=''7000''>I assume from high school you know how to add and
  multiply</span> <span m=''12000''>complex numbers using the relation i squared equals</span>
  <span m=''17000''>negative one. I''m a little less certain that</span> <span m=''23000''>you
  remember how to divide them. I hope you read last night by</span> <span m=''29000''>way
  of preparation for that, but since that''s something</span> <span m=''34000''>we''re
  going to have to do a lot of a differential equations,</span> <span m=''40000''>so
  remember that the division is done by making use of the</span> <span m=''45000''>complex
  conjugate. So, if z is equal to a plus bi,</span> <span m=''50000''>some people
  write a plus ib,</span> <span m=''53000''>and sometimes I''ll do that too if it''s
  more</span> <span m=''57000''>convenient. Then, the complex conjugate is</span>
  <span m=''59000''>what you get by changing i to negative i.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''63000''>And, the important thing is that the product of those two is</span>
  <span m=''66000''>a real number. The product of these is a</span> <span m=''69000''>squared
  minus the quantity ib all squared,</span> <span m=''73000''>which makes a squared
  plus b squared because i</span> <span m=''76000''>squared is negative one.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''79000''>So, the product of those, that''s what you multiply if
  you</span> <span m=''82000''>want to multiply this by something to make it real.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''86000''>You always multiplied by its complex conjugate.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''90000''>And that''s the trick that underlines the doing of the</span>
  <span m=''94000''>division. So, for example,</span> <span m=''96000''>I better hang
  onto these or I''ll never remember all the</span> <span m=''100000''>examples. Suppose,
  for example,</span> <span m=''102000''>we wanted to calculate (two plus i) divided
  by (one minus 3</span> <span m=''107000''>i). To calculate it means I want to</span>
  <span m=''111000''>do the division; I want to express the answer in</span> <span
  m=''115000''>the form a plus bi. What you do is multiply the top</span> <span m=''120000''>and
  bottom by the complex conjugate of the denominator in</span> <span m=''124000''>order
  to make it real. So, it''s (one plus 3i) divided</span> <span m=''129000''>by (one
  plus 3i), as they taught you in</span> <span m=''134000''>elementary school, that
  is one,</span> <span m=''136000''>in a rather odd notation; therefore, multiplying
  doesn''t</span> <span m=''140000''>change the value of the fraction.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''143000''>And so, the denominator now becomes 1 squared plus 3</span> <span m=''147000''>squared,
  which is ten.</span> </p><p><span m=''152000''>And, the numerator is, learn to do
  this without</span> <span m=''155000''>multiplying out four terms. You must be able
  to do this in</span> <span m=''160000''>your head. And, you always do it by the</span>
  <span m=''163000''>grouping, or post office method, whatever you want to call it,</span>
  <span m=''168000''>namely, first put down the real part, which is made out of two</span>
  <span m=''173000''>times one minus three times one. So, that''s negative one.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''177000''>And then, the imaginary part, which is i times one.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''181000''>That''s one, coefficient one, plus 6i.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''186000''>So, that makes 7i. Now, some people feel this</span> <span m=''189000''>still
  doesn''t look right, if you wish,</span> <span m=''192000''>and for some places
  and differential equations,</span> <span m=''195000''>it will be useful to write
  that as minus one tenth plus seven</span> <span m=''200000''>tenths i. And, now
  it''s perfectly clear</span> <span m=''204000''>that it''s in the form a plus bi.
  So, learn to do that if you</span> <span m=''210000''>don''t know already. It''s
  going to be important.</span> </p><p><span m=''213000''>Now, the main thing today
  is the polar representation,</span> <span m=''218000''>which sometimes they don''t
  get to in high school.</span> </p><p><span m=''222000''>And if they do, it''s usually
  not in a grown</span> <span m=''225000''>up-enough in a form for us to be able to
  use it.</span> </p><p><span m=''229000''>So, I have to worry about that little bit.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''232000''>The polar representation, of course, is nominally just</span>
  <span m=''236000''>the switch to polar coordinates. If here''s a plus bi,</span>
  <span m=''240000''>then this is r, and that''s theta.</span> </p><p><span m=''245000''>And
  therefore, this can be written as,</span> <span m=''247000''>in the polar form,
  that would be r cosine theta</span> <span m=''251000''>plus i, or r cosine theta.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''255000''>That''s the A part.</span> </p><p><span m=''258000''>And,
  the B part is, the imaginary part is r</span> <span m=''261000''>sin(theta) times
  i.</span> </p><p><span m=''264000''>Now, it would be customary, at this point,</span>
  <span m=''267000''>to put the i in front, just because it looks better.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''273000''>The complex numbers are commutative, satisfied to</span> <span m=''276000''>commutative
  law of multiplication,</span> <span m=''278000''>which means it doesn''t matter
  in multiplication whether you</span> <span m=''282000''>put i in front or behind.
  It''s still the same answer.</span> </p><p><span m=''286000''>So, this would be
  r cosine theta plus i times</span> <span m=''290000''>r sine theta,</span> <span
  m=''292000''>which, of course, will factor out,</span> <span m=''294000''>and will
  make it cosine theta plus i sine theta.</span> </p><p><span m=''299000''>Now, it
  was Euler who took the</span> <span m=''302000''>decisive step and said, hey, look,
  I''m going to call</span> <span m=''305000''>that e to the i theta.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''310000''>Now, why did he do that? Because everything seemed to</span> <span
  m=''315000''>indicate that it should. But that''s certainly worth the</span> <span
  m=''321000''>best color we have, which is what?</span> </p><p><span m=''324000''>We
  are getting low here. Okay, nonetheless,</span> <span m=''329000''>it''s worth pink.
  I will even give him his due,</span> <span m=''334000''>Euler. Sometimes it''s called
  Euler''s</span> <span m=''338000''>formula, but it really shouldn''t be.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''340000''>It''s not a formula. It''s a definition.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''343000''>So, in some sense, you can''t argue with it.</span> </p><p><span m=''346000''>If
  you want to call putting a complex number in a power,</span> <span m=''350000''>and
  calling it that, you can.</span> </p><p><span m=''353000''>But, one can certainly
  ask why he did it.</span> </p><p><span m=''356000''>And the answer, I guess, is
  that all the</span> <span m=''358000''>evidence seemed to point to the fact that
  it was the thing to</span> <span m=''363000''>do. Now, I think it''s important to</span>
  <span m=''367000''>talk about a little bit because I think it''s,</span> <span m=''370000''>in
  my opinion, if you''re seeing this for the</span> <span m=''373000''>first time,
  even if you read about it last night,</span> <span m=''377000''>it''s a mysterious
  thing, and one needs to see it from</span> <span m=''381000''>every possible point
  of view. It''s something you get used to.</span> </p><p><span m=''385000''>You will
  never see it in a sudden flash of insight.</span> </p><p><span m=''389000''>It will
  just get as familiar to you as more common arithmetic,</span> <span m=''393000''>and
  algebraic, and calculus processes are.</span> </p><p><span m=''398000''>But, look.
  What is it we demand?</span> </p><p><span m=''400000''>If you''re going to call
  something an exponential,</span> <span m=''404000''>what is it we want an exponential
  to do,</span> <span m=''407000''>what gives an expression like this the right to
  be called e to</span> <span m=''412000''>the i theta? The answer is I can''t creep</span>
  <span m=''417000''>inside Euler''s mind. It must have been a very big</span> <span
  m=''421000''>day of his life. He had a lot of big days,</span> <span m=''424000''>but
  when he realized that that was the thing to write down as</span> <span m=''428000''>the
  definition of e to the i theta.</span> </p><p><span m=''432000''>But, what is it
  one wants of an exponential?</span> </p><p><span m=''435000''>Well, the high school
  answer surely is you want it to satisfy</span> <span m=''439000''>the exponential
  law. Now, to my shock,</span> <span m=''442000''>I realize a lot of people don''t
  know.</span> </p><p><span m=''444000''>In my analysis class, these are some math
  majors,</span> <span m=''447000''>or graduate engineers in various subjects,</span>
  <span m=''450000''>and if I say prove such and such using the exponential law,</span>
  <span m=''454000''>I''m sure to get at least half a dozen e-mails asking me,</span>
  <span m=''458000''>what''s the exponential law? Okay, the exponential law is a</span>
  <span m=''464000''>to the x times a to the y equals a to the x plus y:</span> <span
  m=''471000''>the law of exponents.</span> </p><p><span m=''474000''>That''s the
  most important reason why, that''s the single</span> <span m=''479000''>most important
  thing about exponents, are the way one uses</span> <span m=''485000''>them. And,
  this is the exponential</span> <span m=''490000''>function, called the exponential
  function because all this</span> <span m=''496000''>significant stuff is in the
  exponents.</span> </p><p><span m=''500000''>All right, so it should satisfy-- we
  want,</span> <span m=''505000''>first of all, the exponential law to be true.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''511000''>But that''s not all. That''s a high school answer.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''514000''>An MIT answer would be, I mean, why is e to the x such</span>
  <span m=''518000''>a popular function? Well, of course,</span> <span m=''521000''>it
  does satisfy the exponential law, but for us,</span> <span m=''524000''>an even
  more reasonable thing. It''s the function,</span> <span m=''528000''>which, when
  you differentiate it, you get the same thing you</span> <span m=''533000''>started
  with. And, it''s apart from a constant</span> <span m=''536000''>factor, the only
  such function. Now, in terms of differential</span> <span m=''542000''>equations,
  it means that it''s the solution that e to the,</span> <span m=''546000''>let''s
  be a little generous, make it e to the ax.</span> </p><p><span m=''551000''>No,
  better not to use x because complex numbers tend to be</span> <span m=''555000''>called
  x plus iy. Let''s use t as a more neutral</span> <span m=''560000''>variable, which
  is standing outside the fray,</span> <span m=''563000''>as it were. It satisfies
  the relationship</span> <span m=''566000''>that it''s the solution, if you like,</span>
  <span m=''569000''>to the differential equation. That''s a fancy way of saying</span>
  <span m=''574000''>it. dy / dt equals a times y.</span> </p><p><span m=''577000''>Now,
  of course,</span> <span m=''578000''>that is not unique. We could make it unique
  by</span> <span m=''581000''>putting in an initial value. So, if I want to get this</span>
  <span m=''585000''>function and not a constant times it, I should make this an</span>
  <span m=''589000''>initial value problem and say that y of zero should be one.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''592000''>And now, I will get only the</span> <span m=''595000''>function,
  e to the at. So, in other words,</span> <span m=''598000''>that characterizes this
  function.</span> </p><p><span m=''600000''>It''s the only function in the whole
  world that has that</span> <span m=''604000''>property. Now, if you''re going to
  call</span> <span m=''608000''>something e to the i theta, we want that to be true.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''613000''>So, here are my questions. Is it true that e to the i</span>
  <span m=''618000''>theta one, let''s use that, times e to the i theta two,</span>
  <span m=''623000''>see, I''m on a collision course</span> <span m=''629000''>here,
  but that''s easily fixed. Is that equal to e to the i</span> <span m=''635000''>(theta
  one plus theta two)?</span> </p><p><span m=''639000''>If that turns out to be so,
  that''s a big step.</span> </p><p><span m=''643000''>What would we like to be true
  here?</span> </p><p><span m=''646000''>Well, will it be true that the derivative,
  with respect to t of</span> <span m=''652000''>e to the i theta, I would like that
  to be equal</span> <span m=''656000''>to i times e to the i theta.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''661000''>So, question,</span> <span m=''664000''>question. I think those are
  the two most</span> <span m=''667000''>significant things. Now, the nodes do a third</span>
  <span m=''671000''>thing, talk about infinite series.</span> </p><p><span m=''674000''>Since
  we haven''t done infinite series, anyway,</span> <span m=''678000''>it''s not officially
  part of the syllabus, the kind of power</span> <span m=''683000''>series that are
  required. But, I will put it down for the</span> <span m=''688000''>sake of completeness,
  as people like to say.</span> </p><p><span m=''692000''>So, it should behave right.
  The infinite series should be</span> <span m=''699000''>nice. The infinite series
  should work</span> <span m=''704000''>out. There is no word for this,</span> <span
  m=''708000''>should work out, let''s say.</span> </p><p><span m=''711000''>I mean,
  what''s the little music?</span> </p><p><span m=''715000''>Is that some weird music
  idea, or is it only me that hears it?</span> </p><p><span m=''723000''>[LAUGHTER]
  Yes, Lord.</span> </p><p><span m=''728000''>I feel I''m being watched up there.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''731000''>This is terrible. So, there''s one guy.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''734000''>Here''s another guy. And, I won''t put a box around</span> <span m=''738000''>the
  infinite series, since I''m not going to say</span> <span m=''743000''>anything
  about it. Now, these things,</span> <span m=''746000''>in fact, are both true. Otherwise,
  why would I be</span> <span m=''750000''>saying them, and why would Euler have made
  the formula?</span> </p><p><span m=''757000''>But, what''s interesting to see is
  what''s behind them.</span> </p><p><span m=''761000''>And, that gives you little
  practice also in calculating</span> <span m=''767000''>with the complex numbers.
  So, let''s look at the first</span> <span m=''772000''>one. What will it say?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''774000''>It is asking the question. It says, please,</span> <span
  m=''777000''>calculate the product of these two things.</span> </p><p><span m=''781000''>Okay,
  I do it, I''m told.</span> </p><p><span m=''784000''>I will calculate the product
  of cosine theta one plus i cosine</span> <span m=''789000''>theta two-- Sine. Sine
  theta one.</span> </p><p><span m=''794000''>That''s e to the i</span> <span m=''797000''>theta
  one, right?</span> </p><p><span m=''799000''>So, that corresponds to this. The other
  factor times the</span> <span m=''803000''>other factor, cosine theta two plus i
  sine</span> <span m=''806000''>theta two.</span> </p><p><span m=''808000''>Okay,
  what does that come out to be?</span> </p><p><span m=''812000''>Well, again, we
  will use the method of</span> <span m=''814000''>grouping. What''s the real part
  of it?</span> </p><p><span m=''816000''>The real part of it is cosine theta one
  cosine theta two.</span> </p><p><span m=''820000''>And then, there''s a real part,</span>
  <span m=''824000''>which comes from these two factors.</span> </p><p><span m=''827000''>It''s
  going to occur with a minus sign because of the i</span> <span m=''830000''>squared.
  And, what''s left is sine theta</span> <span m=''833000''>one sine theta two.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''836000''>And then, the imaginary part, I''ll factor out the i.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''841000''>And then, what''s left, I won''t have to keep repeating</span>
  <span m=''845000''>the i. So, it will have to be sine</span> <span m=''848000''>theta
  one cosine theta two.</span> </p><p><span m=''853000''>And, the other factor will
  be cosine theta one sine theta</span> <span m=''858000''>two-- plus sine theta two
  cosine theta one.</span> </p><p><span m=''862000''>Well, it looks like a mess,</span>
  <span m=''867000''>but, again, high school to the rescue.</span> </p><p><span m=''870000''>What
  is this? The top thing is nothing in</span> <span m=''875000''>disguise, but it''s
  a disguised form of cosine (theta one plus</span> <span m=''881000''>theta two).</span>
  </p><p><span m=''884000''>And the bottom is sine of (theta one plus theta two).</span>
  </p><p><span m=''889000''>So, the product of these two</span> <span m=''894000''>things
  is this, and that''s exactly the formula.</span> </p><p><span m=''898000''>In other
  words, this formula is a way of</span> <span m=''902000''>writing those two trigonometric
  identities for the cosine of the</span> <span m=''907000''>sum and the sine of the
  sum. Instead of the two identities</span> <span m=''913000''>taking up that much
  space, written one after the other,</span> <span m=''917000''>they take up as much
  space, and they say exactly the same</span> <span m=''920000''>thing. Those two
  trigonometric</span> <span m=''922000''>identities are exactly the same as saying
  that e to the i theta</span> <span m=''926000''>satisfies the exponential law.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''930000''>Now, people ask, you know, what''s beautiful in</span>
  <span m=''933000''>mathematics? To me, that''s beautiful.</span> </p><p><span m=''936000''>I
  think that''s great. Something long turns into</span> <span m=''939000''>something
  short, and it''s just as good,</span> <span m=''942000''>and moreover, connects
  with all these other</span> <span m=''945000''>things in the world, differential
  equations,</span> <span m=''949000''>infinite series, blah, blah, blah,</span> <span
  m=''951000''>blah, blah. Okay, I don''t have to sell</span> <span m=''954000''>Euler.
  He sells himself.</span> </p><p><span m=''956000''>Now, how about the other one?
  How about the other one?</span> </p><p><span m=''962000''>Now, that''s obviously,
  I haven''t said something</span> <span m=''969000''>because for one thing, how do
  you differentiate if</span> <span m=''977000''>there''s theta here, and t down there.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''982000''>Okay, that''s easily fixed. But, how do I differentiate</span>
  <span m=''990000''>this? What kind of a guy is e to the</span> <span m=''993000''>i
  theta? Well, if I write it out,</span> <span m=''997000''>take a look at what it
  is. It''s cosine theta plus i sine</span> <span m=''1001000''>theta.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1004000''>As theta varies, it''s a function.</span> </p><p><span m=''1007000''>The
  variable is real. Theta is a real variable.</span> </p><p><span m=''1011000''>Its
  angle in radians, but it runs from negative</span> <span m=''1015000''>infinity
  to infinity. So, if you think of functions</span> <span m=''1019000''>as a black
  box, what''s going in is a real</span> <span m=''1022000''>number. But, what''s
  coming out is a</span> <span m=''1026000''>complex number. So, schematically,</span>
  <span m=''1029000''>here is the e to the i theta box,</span> <span m=''1032000''>if
  you like to think that way, theta goes in,</span> <span m=''1035000''>and that''s
  real, and a complex number,</span> <span m=''1038000''>this particular complex number
  goes out.</span> </p><p><span m=''1040000''>So, one, we''d call it, I''m not going
  to write this</span> <span m=''1044000''>down because it''s sort of pompous and
  takes too long.</span> </p><p><span m=''1048000''>But, it is a complex valued function
  of a real variable.</span> </p><p><span m=''1053000''>You got that? Up to now, we
  studied real</span> <span m=''1056000''>functions of real variables. But now, real
  valued functions</span> <span m=''1061000''>of real variables, those are the kind
  calculus is</span> <span m=''1065000''>concerned with. But now, it''s a complex-valued</span>
  <span m=''1068000''>function because the variable is real.</span> </p><p><span m=''1071000''>But,
  the output, the value of the function is a</span> <span m=''1075000''>complex number.
  Now, in general,</span> <span m=''1078000''>such a function, well, maybe a better
  say,</span> <span m=''1081000''>complex-valued, how about complex-valued</span>
  <span m=''1084000''>function of a real variable, let''s change the name of the</span>
  <span m=''1089000''>variable. t is always a real variable.</span> </p><p><span m=''1094000''>I
  don''t think we have complex time yet, although I''m sure</span> <span m=''1099000''>there
  will be someday. But, the next Einstein appears.</span> </p><p><span m=''1104000''>A
  complex-valued function of a real variable,</span> <span m=''1108000''>t, in general,
  would look like this.</span> </p><p><span m=''1112000''>t goes in, and what comes
  out? Well: a complex number,</span> <span m=''1115000''>which I would then have
  to write this way.</span> </p><p><span m=''1118000''>In other words, the real part
  depends on t,</span> <span m=''1121000''>and the imaginary part depends upon t.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1124000''>So, a general function looks like this, a general</span>
  <span m=''1127000''>complex-valued function. This is just a special case of</span>
  <span m=''1131000''>it, where the variable has a different name.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1134000''>But, the first function would be cosine t, and the second</span> <span
  m=''1137000''>function would be sine t. So, my only question is,</span> <span m=''1141000''>how
  do you differentiate such a thing?</span> </p><p><span m=''1143000''>Well, I''m
  not going to fuss over this.</span> </p><p><span m=''1148000''>The general definition
  is, with deltas and whatnot,</span> <span m=''1151000''>but the end result of a
  perfectly fine definition is,</span> <span m=''1154000''>you differentiate it by
  differentiating each component.</span> </p><p><span m=''1158000''>The reason you
  don''t have to work so very hard is because</span> <span m=''1162000''>this is a
  real variable, and I already know what it</span> <span m=''1165000''>means to differentiate
  a function of a real variable.</span> </p><p><span m=''1170000''>So, I could write
  it this way, that the derivative of u plus</span> <span m=''1174000''>iv, I''ll
  abbreviate it that way, this means the derivative,</span> <span m=''1177000''>with
  respect to whatever variable, since I didn''t tell</span> <span m=''1181000''>you
  what the variable in these functions were,</span> <span m=''1184000''>well, I don''t
  have to tell you what I''m differentiating with</span> <span m=''1188000''>respect
  to. It''s whatever was there because</span> <span m=''1191000''>you can''t see.
  And the answer is,</span> <span m=''1193000''>it would be the derivative of u plus
  i times the derivative of</span> <span m=''1197000''>v. You differentiate it just
  the</span> <span m=''1201000''>way you would if these were the components of a motion
  vector.</span> </p><p><span m=''1205000''>You would get the velocity by differentiating
  each component</span> <span m=''1209000''>separately. And, that''s what you''re
  doing</span> <span m=''1212000''>here. Okay, now, the importance of</span> <span
  m=''1215000''>that is that it at least tells me what it is I have to check</span>
  <span m=''1219000''>when I check this formula. So, let''s do it now that we</span>
  <span m=''1223000''>know what this is. We know how to differentiate</span> <span
  m=''1226000''>the function. Let''s actually differentiate</span> <span m=''1229000''>it.
  That''s fortunately,</span> <span m=''1232000''>by far, the easiest part of the
  whole process.</span> </p><p><span m=''1237000''>So, let''s do it. So, what''s the
  derivative?</span> </p><p><span m=''1241000''>Let''s go back to t, our generic variable.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1245000''>I want to emphasize that these functions, when we write
  them as</span> <span m=''1251000''>functions, that theta will almost never be the
  variable</span> <span m=''1256000''>outside of these notes on complex numbers.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1262000''>It will normally be time or something like that,</span>
  <span m=''1265000''>or x, a neutral variable like x.</span> </p><p><span m=''1267000''>So,
  what''s the derivative of e to the i theta?</span> </p><p><span m=''1272000''>I''m
  hoping that it will turn out to be i e to the i theta,</span> <span m=''1276000''>and
  that the yellow law may be</span> <span m=''1279000''>true just as the green one
  was. Okay, let''s calculate it.</span> </p><p><span m=''1283000''>It''s the derivative,
  with respect to,</span> <span m=''1286000''>unfortunately I can convert t''s to
  thetas, but not thetas to</span> <span m=''1290000''>t''s. C''est la vie,</span>
  <span m=''1293000''>okay. Times cosine t plus i sine t,</span> <span m=''1296000''>and
  what''s that?</span> </p><p><span m=''1300000''>Well, the derivative of cosine t,
  differentiating the real and</span> <span m=''1306000''>imaginary parts separately,
  and adding them up.</span> </p><p><span m=''1311000''>It''s negative sine t, plus
  i times cosine t.</span> </p><p><span m=''1316000''>Now, let''s factor out at the
  i,</span> <span m=''1321000''>because it says if I factor out the i, what do I get?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1328000''>Well, now, the real part of what''s left would be cosine
  t.</span> </p><p><span m=''1332000''>And, how about the imaginary part?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1335000''>Do you see, it will be i sine t because i times i</span> <span m=''1341000''>gives
  me that negative one.</span> </p><p><span m=''1344000''>And, what''s that? e to
  the it.</span> </p><p><span m=''1347000''>i times e to the i t.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1350000''>So, that works too. What about the initial</span> <span m=''1355000''>condition?
  No problem.</span> </p><p><span m=''1358000''>What is y of zero? What''s the function
  at zero?</span> </p><p><span m=''1363000''>Well, don''t say right away, i times
  zero is zero,</span> <span m=''1369000''>so it must be one. That''s illegal because,</span>
  <span m=''1374000''>why is that illegal? It''s because in that formula,</span> <span
  m=''1380000''>you are not multiplying i times theta.</span> </p><p><span m=''1386000''>I
  mean, sort of, you are, but that formula is</span> <span m=''1389000''>the meaning
  of e to the i theta.</span> </p><p><span m=''1392000''>Now, it would be very nice
  if this is like,</span> <span m=''1396000''>well, anyway, you can''t do that.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1398000''>So, you have to do it by saying it''s the cosine of zero
  plus i</span> <span m=''1403000''>times the sine of zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''1406000''>And,
  how much is that? The sine of zero is zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''1411000''>Now,
  it''s okay to say i times zero is zero because that''s the</span> <span m=''1415000''>way
  complex numbers multiply. What is the cosine of zero?</span> </p><p><span m=''1420000''>That''s
  one. So, the answer,</span> <span m=''1422000''>indeed, turns out to be one. So,
  this checks,</span> <span m=''1426000''>really, from every conceivable standpoint
  down as I indicated,</span> <span m=''1431000''>also from the standpoint of infinite
  series.</span> </p><p><span m=''1434000''>So, we are definitely allowed to use this.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1438000''>Now, the more general exponential law is true.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1443000''>I''m not going to say much about it.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1445000''>So, in other words, e to the a, this is really a</span> <span m=''1449000''>definition.
  e to the (a plus ib)</span> <span m=''1453000''>is going to be, in order for the
  general</span> <span m=''1457000''>exponential law to be true, this is really a
  definition.</span> </p><p><span m=''1461000''>It''s e to the a times e to the ib.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1466000''>Now, notice when I look at the-- at any complex number,</span>
  <span m=''1470000''>-- -- so, in terms of this,</span> <span m=''1474000''>the polar
  form of a complex number, to draw the little</span> <span m=''1478000''>picture
  again, if here is our complex number,</span> <span m=''1482000''>and here is r,
  and here is the angle theta,</span> <span m=''1486000''>so the nice way to write
  this complex number is r e to the i</span> <span m=''1491000''>theta. The e to the
  i theta</span> <span m=''1496000''>is, now, why is that?</span> </p><p><span m=''1500000''>What
  is the magnitude of this? This is r.</span> </p><p><span m=''1504000''>The length
  of the absolute value, I didn''t talk about</span> <span m=''1510000''>magnitude
  in argument. I guess I should have.</span> </p><p><span m=''1514000''>But, it''s
  in the notes. So, r is called the modulus.</span> </p><p><span m=''1520000''>Well,
  the fancy word is the modulus.</span> </p><p><span m=''1524000''>And, we haven''t
  given the complex number a name.</span> </p><p><span m=''1529000''>Let''s call it
  alpha, modulus of alpha,</span> <span m=''1533000''>and theta is called, it''s the
  angle.</span> </p><p><span m=''1539000''>It''s called the argument. I didn''t make
  up these words.</span> </p><p><span m=''1544000''>There, from a tradition of English
  that has long since</span> <span m=''1549000''>vanished, when I was a kid, and you
  wanted to know what a</span> <span m=''1555000''>play was about, you looked in the
  playbill,</span> <span m=''1559000''>and it said the argument of the play, it''s
  that old-fashioned</span> <span m=''1565000''>use of the word argument. Argument
  means the angle,</span> <span m=''1571000''>and sometimes that''s abbreviated by
  arg alpha.</span> </p><p><span m=''1576000''>And, this is abbreviated,</span> <span
  m=''1581000''>of course, as absolute value of alpha, its length.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1586000''>Okay, the notes give you a little practice changing things</span>
  <span m=''1593000''>to a polar form. I think we will skip that in</span> <span m=''1599000''>favor
  of doing a couple of other things because that''s pretty</span> <span m=''1606000''>easy.
  But let me, you should at least</span> <span m=''1610000''>realize when you should
  look at polar form.</span> </p><p><span m=''1615000''>The great advantage of polar
  form is, particularly once</span> <span m=''1621000''>you''ve mastered the exponential
  law, the great advantage of</span> <span m=''1628000''>polar form is it''s good
  for multiplication.</span> </p><p><span m=''1635000''>Now, of course, you know how
  to multiply</span> <span m=''1637000''>complex numbers, even when they are in the</span>
  <span m=''1640000''>Cartesian form. That''s the first thing you</span> <span m=''1643000''>learn
  in high school, how to multiply a plus bi times</span> <span m=''1647000''>c plus
  di. But, as you will see,</span> <span m=''1651000''>when push comes to shove, you
  will see this very clearly</span> <span m=''1655000''>on Friday when we talk about
  trigonometric inputs to</span> <span m=''1659000''>differential equations, --</span>
  <span m=''1662000''>-- that the changing to complex numbers makes all sorts of</span>
  <span m=''1666000''>things easy to calculate, and the answers come out</span> <span
  m=''1669000''>extremely clear, whereas if we had to do it any</span> <span m=''1672000''>other
  way, it''s a lot more work. And worst of all,</span> <span m=''1676000''>when you
  finally slog through to the end, you fear you are</span> <span m=''1680000''>none
  the wiser. It''s good for multiplication</span> <span m=''1683000''>because the
  product, so here''s any number in its</span> <span m=''1687000''>polar form. That''s
  a general complex</span> <span m=''1689000''>number. It''s modulus times e to the
  i</span> <span m=''1692000''>theta times r two e to the i theta two--</span> <span
  m=''1696000''>Well, you just multiply them as</span> <span m=''1699000''>ordinary
  numbers. So, the part out front will be</span> <span m=''1702000''>r1 r2, and the
  e to the i theta parts gets</span> <span m=''1706000''>multiplied by the exponential
  law and becomes e to the i</span> <span m=''1710000''>(theta one plus theta two)
  --</span> <span m=''1716000''>-- which makes very clear that the multiply geometrically
  two</span> <span m=''1722000''>complex numbers, you multiply the moduli,</span>
  <span m=''1726000''>the r''s, the absolute values, how long the arrow is from zero</span>
  <span m=''1732000''>to the complex number, multiply the moduli,</span> <span m=''1736000''>and
  add the arguments. So the new number,</span> <span m=''1742000''>its modulus is
  the product of r1 and r2.</span> </p><p><span m=''1747000''>And, its argument, its
  angle, polar angle,</span> <span m=''1752000''>is the sum of the old two angles.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1755000''>And, you add the angles. And, you put down in your books</span>
  <span m=''1762000''>angles, but I''m being photographed,</span> <span m=''1766000''>so
  I''m going to write arguments.</span> </p><p><span m=''1771000''>In other words,
  it makes the geometric content</span> <span m=''1774000''>of multiplication clear,
  in a sense in which this is</span> <span m=''1778000''>extremely unclear. From this
  law,</span> <span m=''1780000''>blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, whatever it turns</span>
  <span m=''1784000''>out to be, you have not the slightest intuition that this is</span>
  <span m=''1788000''>true about the complex numbers. That first thing is just a</span>
  <span m=''1792000''>formula, whereas this thing is insightful representation of</span>
  <span m=''1797000''>complex multiplication. Now, I''d like to use it for</span>
  <span m=''1802000''>something, but before we do that, let me just indicate how</span>
  <span m=''1808000''>just the exponential notation enables you to do things in</span>
  <span m=''1814000''>calculus, formulas that are impossible to remember from</span>
  <span m=''1819000''>calculus. It makes them very easy to</span> <span m=''1823000''>derive.
  A typical example of that is,</span> <span m=''1827000''>suppose you want to, for
  example,</span> <span m=''1830000''>integrate (e to the negative x) cosine x.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1838000''>Well, number one, you spend a few minutes running</span>
  <span m=''1841000''>through a calculus textbook and try to find out the answer</span>
  <span m=''1845000''>because you know you are not going to remember how to do it.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1849000''>Or, you run to a computer, and type in Matlab and</span>
  <span m=''1853000''>something. Or, you fish out your little</span> <span m=''1855000''>pocket
  calculator, which will give you a formula,</span> <span m=''1859000''>and so on.
  So, you have aides for doing</span> <span m=''1863000''>that. But, the way to do
  it if you''re</span> <span m=''1866000''>on a desert island, and the way I always
  do it</span> <span m=''1870000''>because I never have any of these little aides
  around,</span> <span m=''1874000''>and I cannot trust my memory, probably a certain
  number of</span> <span m=''1879000''>you remember how you did it at high school,
  or how you did it</span> <span m=''1884000''>in 18.01, if you took it here. You
  have to use integration by</span> <span m=''1889000''>parts. But, it''s one of the
  tricky</span> <span m=''1893000''>things that''s not required on an exam because
  you had to use</span> <span m=''1897000''>integration by parts twice in the same
  direction,</span> <span m=''1900000''>and then suddenly by comparing the end product
  with the initial</span> <span m=''1905000''>product and writing an equation. Somehow,
  the value falls out.</span> </p><p><span m=''1910000''>Well, that''s tricky. And
  it''s not the sort of thing</span> <span m=''1913000''>you can waste time stuffing
  into your head, unless you are going</span> <span m=''1918000''>to be the integration
  bee during IAP or something like that.</span> </p><p><span m=''1924000''>Instead,
  using complex numbers is the way to do this.</span> </p><p><span m=''1929000''>How
  do I think of this, cosine x?</span> </p><p><span m=''1932000''>What I do, is I
  think of that e to the negative x cosine x</span> <span m=''1938000''>is the real
  part, the real part of what?</span> </p><p><span m=''1944000''>Well, cosine x is
  the real part of e to the ix.</span> </p><p><span m=''1949000''>So, this thing,
  this is real.</span> </p><p><span m=''1952000''>This is real, too.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1954000''>But I''m thinking of it as the real part of e to the ix.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1959000''>Now, if I multiply these two</span> <span m=''1965000''>together,
  this is going to turn out to be, therefore,</span> <span m=''1969000''>the real
  part of e to the minus x.</span> </p><p><span m=''1973000''>I''ll write it out very
  pompously, and then I will fix</span> <span m=''1977000''>it. I would never write
  this,</span> <span m=''1980000''>you are you. Okay, it''s e to the minus x</span>
  <span m=''1984000''>times, when I write cosine x plus i sine x,</span> <span m=''1989000''>so
  it is the real part of that is cosine x.</span> </p><p><span m=''1994000''>So, it''s
  the real part of, write it this way for real part</span> <span m=''2000000''>of
  e to the, factor out the x, and what''s up there is</span> <span m=''2006000''>(negative
  one plus i) times x.</span> </p><p><span m=''2013000''>Okay, and now, so, the idea
  is the same thing</span> <span m=''2016000''>is going to be true for the integral.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2019000''>This is going to be the real part of that,</span> <span
  m=''2023000''>the integral of e to the (minus one plus i) times x dx.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2028000''>In other words,</span> <span m=''2031000''>what you do is, this procedure
  is called</span> <span m=''2034000''>complexifying the integral. Instead of looking
  at the</span> <span m=''2038000''>original real problem, I''m going to turn it into
  a</span> <span m=''2043000''>complex problem by turning this thing into a complex</span>
  <span m=''2047000''>exponential. This is the real part of that</span> <span m=''2052000''>complex
  exponential. Now, what''s the advantage of</span> <span m=''2055000''>doing that?
  Simple.</span> </p><p><span m=''2056000''>It''s because nothing is easier to integrate
  than an</span> <span m=''2060000''>exponential. And, though you may have some</span>
  <span m=''2063000''>doubts as to whether the familiar laws work also with</span>
  <span m=''2066000''>complex exponentials, I assure you they all do.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2070000''>It would be lovely to sit and prove them.</span> </p><p><span m=''2074000''>On
  the other hand, I think after a while,</span> <span m=''2077000''>you find it rather
  dull. So, I''m going to do the fun</span> <span m=''2081000''>things, and assume
  that they are true because they are.</span> </p><p><span m=''2086000''>So, what''s
  the integral of e to the (minus one plus i) x dx?</span> </p><p><span m=''2094000''>Well,
  if there is justice in heaven, it must be e to the</span> <span m=''2098000''>(minus
  one plus i) times x divided by minus one plus i.</span> </p><p><span m=''2103000''>In
  some sense,</span> <span m=''2108000''>that''s the answer. This does, in fact,</span>
  <span m=''2112000''>give that. That''s correct.</span> </p><p><span m=''2115000''>I
  want the real part of this. I want the real part because</span> <span m=''2122000''>that''s
  the way the original problem was stated.</span> </p><p><span m=''2127000''>I want
  the real part only. So, I want the real part of</span> <span m=''2134000''>this.
  Now, this is what separates the</span> <span m=''2138000''>girls from the women.
  [LAUGHTER] This is why you have</span> <span m=''2144000''>to know how to divide
  complex numbers.</span> </p><p><span m=''2148000''>So, watch how I find the real
  part.</span> </p><p><span m=''2152000''>I write it this way. Normally when I do
  the</span> <span m=''2156000''>calculations for myself, I would skip a couple of
  these</span> <span m=''2162000''>steps. But this time,</span> <span m=''2165000''>I
  will write everything out. You''re going to have to do this</span> <span m=''2169000''>a
  lot in this course, by the way, both over the</span> <span m=''2172000''>course
  of the next few weeks, and especially towards the end</span> <span m=''2176000''>of
  the term where we get into a complex systems,</span> <span m=''2179000''>which involve
  complex numbers. There''s a lot of this.</span> </p><p><span m=''2182000''>So, now
  is the time to learn to do it, and to feel skillful at</span> <span m=''2186000''>it.
  So, it''s this times e to the</span> <span m=''2188000''>negative x times e to the
  ix,</span> <span m=''2191000''>which is cosine x plus i sine x.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2196000''>Now, I''m not ready, yet, to do the calculation to</span> <span m=''2199000''>find
  the real part because I don''t like the way this looks.</span> </p><p><span m=''2203000''>I
  want to go back to the thing I did right at the very</span> <span m=''2206000''>beginning
  of the hour, and turn it into an a plus bi</span> <span m=''2210000''>type of complex
  number.</span> </p><p><span m=''2212000''>In other words, what we have to do is
  the</span> <span m=''2215000''>division. So, the division is going to</span> <span
  m=''2217000''>be, now, I''m going to ask you to do it in your head.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2222000''>I multiply the top and bottom by negative one minus I.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2226000''>What does that put in the denominator?</span> </p><p><span m=''2229000''>One
  squared plus one squared: Two.</span> </p><p><span m=''2233000''>And in the numerator,
  negative one minus i.</span> </p><p><span m=''2237000''>This is the same as that.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2240000''>But now, it looks at the form a + bi.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2244000''>It''s negative one over two minus i times one half.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2248000''>So, this is multiplied by e to</span> <span m=''2253000''>the minus
  x and cosine x.</span> </p><p><span m=''2256000''>So, if you are doing it, and practice
  a little bit,</span> <span m=''2260000''>please don''t put in all these steps.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2262000''>Go from here; well, I would go from here to</span> <span
  m=''2266000''>here by myself. Maybe you shouldn''t.</span> </p><p><span m=''2268000''>Practice
  a little before you do that.</span> </p><p><span m=''2271000''>And now, what do
  we do with this?</span> </p><p><span m=''2273000''>Now, this is in a form to pick
  out the real part.</span> </p><p><span m=''2277000''>We want the real part of this.
  So, you don''t have to write the</span> <span m=''2283000''>whole thing out as a
  complex number.</span> </p><p><span m=''2285000''>In other words, you don''t have
  to do all the</span> <span m=''2288000''>multiplications. You only have to find
  the real</span> <span m=''2291000''>part of it, which is what? Well, e to the negative
  x</span> <span m=''2294000''>will be simply a factor.</span> </p><p><span m=''2296000''>That''s
  a real factor, which I don''t have to worry</span> <span m=''2300000''>about. And,
  in that category,</span> <span m=''2301000''>I can include the two also. So, I only
  have to pick out the</span> <span m=''2305000''>real part of this times that. And,
  what''s that?</span> </p><p><span m=''2310000''>It''s negative cosine x.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2312000''>And, the other real part comes from the product of these
  two</span> <span m=''2317000''>things. I times negative i is one.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2320000''>And, what''s left is sine x.</span> </p><p><span m=''2322000''>So,
  that''s the answer to the</span> <span m=''2325000''>question. That''s the integral
  of e to the</span> <span m=''2328000''>negative x * cosine x.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2332000''>Notice, it''s a completely straightforward process.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2336000''>It doesn''t involve any tricks, unless you call going to the</span>
  <span m=''2340000''>complex domain a trick. But, I don''t.</span> </p><p><span m=''2344000''>As
  soon as you see in this course the combination of e to</span> <span m=''2348000''>ax
  times cosine bx or sine bx,</span> <span m=''2351000''>you should immediately think,</span>
  <span m=''2354000''>and you''re going to get plenty of it in the couple of weeks</span>
  <span m=''2358000''>after the exam, you are going to get plenty of</span> <span
  m=''2361000''>it, and you should immediately think of passing to the complex</span>
  <span m=''2365000''>domain. That will be the standard way</span> <span m=''2367000''>we
  solve such problems. So, you''re going to get lots of</span> <span m=''2372000''>practice
  doing this. But, this was the first time.</span> </p><p><span m=''2377000''>Now,
  I guess in the time remaining, I''m not going to talk</span> <span m=''2382000''>about
  in the notes, i, R, at all,</span> <span m=''2384000''>but I would like to talk
  a little bit about the extraction</span> <span m=''2389000''>of the complex roots,
  since you have a problem about</span> <span m=''2394000''>that and because it''s
  another beautiful application of this</span> <span m=''2399000''>polar way of writing
  complex numbers.</span> </p><p><span m=''2404000''>Suppose I want to calculate.
  So, the basic problem is to</span> <span m=''2409000''>calculate the nth roots of
  one. Now, in the real domain,</span> <span m=''2415000''>of course, the answer is,
  sometimes there''s only one of</span> <span m=''2421000''>these, one itself, and
  sometimes there are two,</span> <span m=''2426000''>depending on whether n is an
  even number or an odd number.</span> </p><p><span m=''2434000''>But, in the complex
  domain, there are always n answers as</span> <span m=''2440000''>complex numbers.
  One always has n nth roots.</span> </p><p><span m=''2445000''>Now, where are they?
  Well, geometrically,</span> <span m=''2450000''>it''s easy to see where they are.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2454000''>Here''s the unit circle. Here''s the unit circle.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2461000''>One of the roots is right here at one.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2464000''>Now, where are the others? Well, do you see that if I</span> <span
  m=''2469000''>place, let''s take n equal five because that''s a nice,</span> <span
  m=''2474000''>dramatic number. If I place these peptides</span> <span m=''2478000''>equally
  spaced points around the unit circle, so,</span> <span m=''2483000''>in other words,
  this angle is alpha.</span> </p><p><span m=''2486000''>Alpha should be the angle.
  What would be the expression</span> <span m=''2492000''>for that? If there were
  five such equally</span> <span m=''2497000''>spaced, it would be one fifth of all
  the way around the circle.</span> </p><p><span m=''2503000''>All the way around
  the circle is two pi.</span> </p><p><span m=''2507000''>So, it will be one fifth
  of two pi in radians.</span> </p><p><span m=''2512000''>Now, it''s geometrically
  clear that those are the five fifth</span> <span m=''2518000''>roots because, how
  do I multiply complex</span> <span m=''2522000''>numbers? I multiply the moduli.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2526000''>Well, they all have moduli one. So, if I take this guy,</span>
  <span m=''2531000''>let''s call that complex number, oh, I hate to give you,</span>
  <span m=''2536000''>they are always giving you Greek notation.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2540000''>All right, why not torture you? Zeta.</span> </p><p><span m=''2543000''>At
  least you will learn how to make a zeta in this period,</span> <span m=''2548000''>small
  zeta, so that''s zeta. There''s our fifth root of</span> <span m=''2554000''>unity.
  It''s the first one that occurs</span> <span m=''2556000''>on the circle that isn''t
  the trivial one, one.</span> </p><p><span m=''2560000''>Now, do you see that, how
  would I calculate zeta to</span> <span m=''2564000''>the fifth? Well, if I write
  zeta in polar</span> <span m=''2567000''>notation, what would it be? The modulus
  would be one,</span> <span m=''2571000''>and therefore it will be simply, the r
  will be one</span> <span m=''2576000''>for it because its length is one.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2579000''>Its modulus is one. What''s up here?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2583000''>I times that angle, and that angle is two pi over</span> <span m=''2586000''>five.
  So, there''s just,</span> <span m=''2589000''>geometrically I see where zeta is.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2591000''>And, if I translate that geometry into the e to the i</span>
  <span m=''2595000''>theta form for the formula, I see that it must</span> <span
  m=''2600000''>be that number. Now, let''s say somebody gives</span> <span m=''2603000''>you
  that number and says, hey, is this the fifth root of</span> <span m=''2607000''>one?
  I forbid you to draw any</span> <span m=''2610000''>pictures. What would you do?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2613000''>You say, well, I''ll raise it to the fifth</span> <span
  m=''2616000''>power. What''s zeta to the fifth power?</span> </p><p><span m=''2619000''>Well,
  it''s e to the i two pi / five,</span> <span m=''2623000''>and now, if I think of
  raising that to the fifth power,</span> <span m=''2628000''>by the exponential law,
  that''s the same thing as</span> <span m=''2631000''>putting a five in front of
  the exponent.</span> </p><p><span m=''2634000''>So, this times five, and what''s
  that?</span> </p><p><span m=''2637000''>That''s e to the i times two pi.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2641000''>And, what is that? Well, it''s the angle.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2646000''>If the angle is two pi, I''ve gone all the way around</span> <span
  m=''2653000''>the circle and come back here again.</span> </p><p><span m=''2657000''>I''ve
  got the number one. So, this is one.</span> </p><p><span m=''2662000''>Since the
  argument, two pi, is the same as an</span> <span m=''2668000''>angle, it''s the
  same as, well, let''s not write it that</span> <span m=''2675000''>way. It''s wrong.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2679000''>It''s just wrong since two pi and zero are the same angle.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2692000''>So, I could replace this by zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2701000''>Oh dear. Well, I guess I have to stop</span> <span m=''2709000''>right
  in the middle of things. So, you''re going to have to</span> <span m=''2722000''>read
  a little bit about how to find roots in order to do that</span> <span m=''2736000''>problem.
  And, we will go on from that</span> <span m=''2744000''>point Friday.</span> </p>'
