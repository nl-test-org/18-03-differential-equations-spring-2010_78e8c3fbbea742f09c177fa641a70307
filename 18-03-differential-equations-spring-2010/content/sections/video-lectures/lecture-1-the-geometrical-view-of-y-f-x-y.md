transcript: '<p><span m=''7000''>OK, let''s get started. I''m assuming that,</span>
  <span m=''10000''>A, you went recitation yesterday, B,</span> <span m=''13000''>that
  even if you didn''t, you know how to separate</span> <span m=''17000''>variables,
  and you know how to construct simple models,</span> <span m=''21000''>solve physical
  problems with differential equations,</span> <span m=''25000''>and possibly even
  solve them. So, you should have learned</span> <span m=''31000''>that either in
  high school, or 18.01 here,</span> <span m=''35000''>or, yeah. So, I''m going to
  start from</span> <span m=''38000''>that point, assume you know that.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''42000''>I''m not going to tell you what differential equations are,</span> <span
  m=''47000''>or what modeling is. If you still are uncertain</span> <span m=''51000''>about
  those things, the book has a very long and</span> <span m=''56000''>good explanation
  of it. Just read that stuff.</span> </p><p><span m=''60000''>So, we are talking
  about first order ODEs.</span> </p><p><span m=''66000''>ODE: I''ll only use two
  acronyms.</span> </p><p><span m=''68000''>ODE is ordinary differential equations.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''72000''>I think all of MIT knows that, whether they''ve been taking
  the</span> <span m=''77000''>course or not. So, we are talking about</span> <span
  m=''81000''>first-order ODEs, which in standard form,</span> <span m=''85000''>are
  written, you isolate the derivative of y</span> <span m=''89000''>with respect to,
  x, let''s say,</span> <span m=''91000''>on the left-hand side, and on the right-hand
  side you</span> <span m=''96000''>write everything else. You can''t always do this
  very</span> <span m=''102000''>well, but for today, I''m going to assume that it
  has</span> <span m=''107000''>been done and it''s doable. So, for example,</span>
  <span m=''110000''>some of the ones that will be considered either today or in</span>
  <span m=''116000''>the problem set are things like y prime equals x over y.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''121000''>That''s pretty simple.</span> </p><p><span m=''125000''>The
  problem set has y prime equals, let''s see,</span> <span m=''131000''>x minus y
  squared.</span> </p><p><span m=''135000''>And, it also has y prime equals y minus
  x squared.</span> </p><p><span m=''142000''>There are others,</span> <span m=''145000''>too.
  Now, when you look at this,</span> <span m=''149000''>this, of course, you can solve
  by separating</span> <span m=''155000''>variables. So, this is solvable.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''159000''>This one is-- and neither of these can you separate</span>
  <span m=''163000''>variables. And they look extremely</span> <span m=''166000''>similar.
  But they are extremely</span> <span m=''168000''>dissimilar. The most dissimilar
  about them</span> <span m=''172000''>is that this one is easily solvable.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''174000''>And you will learn, if you don''t know already,</span>
  <span m=''178000''>next time next Friday how to solve this one.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''183000''>This one, which looks almost the same, is unsolvable in a</span> <span
  m=''186000''>certain sense. Namely, there are no elementary</span> <span m=''189000''>functions
  which you can write down, which will give a solution</span> <span m=''193000''>of
  that differential equation. So, right away,</span> <span m=''196000''>one confronts
  the most significant fact that even for</span> <span m=''199000''>the simplest possible
  differential equations,</span> <span m=''202000''>those which only involve the first
  derivative,</span> <span m=''205000''>it''s possible to write down extremely looking
  simple guys.</span> </p><p><span m=''210000''>I''ll put this one up in blue to indicate
  that it''s bad.</span> </p><p><span m=''215000''>Whoops, sorry, I mean, not really
  bad,</span> <span m=''218000''>but recalcitrant. It''s not solvable in the</span>
  <span m=''222000''>ordinary sense in which you think of an equation is</span> <span
  m=''226000''>solvable. And, since those equations are</span> <span m=''230000''>the
  rule rather than the exception, I''m going about this</span> <span m=''235000''>first
  day to not solving a single differential equation,</span> <span m=''240000''>but
  indicating to you what you do when you meet a blue equation</span> <span m=''246000''>like
  that. What do you do with it?</span> </p><p><span m=''251000''>So, this first day
  is going to be devoted to geometric ways of</span> <span m=''257000''>looking at
  differential equations and numerical.</span> </p><p><span m=''261000''>At the very
  end, I''ll talk a little bit about</span> <span m=''265000''>numerical ways. And
  you''ll work on both of</span> <span m=''269000''>those for the first problem set.
  So, what''s our geometric view</span> <span m=''275000''>of differential equations?
  Well, it''s something that''s</span> <span m=''281000''>contrasted with the usual
  procedures, by which you solve</span> <span m=''285000''>things and find elementary
  functions which solve them.</span> </p><p><span m=''289000''>I''ll call that the
  analytic method.</span> </p><p><span m=''292000''>So, on the one hand, we have the
  analytic ideas,</span> <span m=''296000''>in which you write down explicitly the
  equation,</span> <span m=''299000''>y prime equals f of x,y.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''304000''>And, you look for certain functions, which are called its</span> <span
  m=''307000''>solutions. Now, so there''s the ODE.</span> </p><p><span m=''309000''>And,
  y1 of x, notice I don''t use a separate</span> <span m=''312000''>letter. I don''t
  use g or h or something</span> <span m=''314000''>like that for the solution because
  the letters multiply so</span> <span m=''318000''>quickly, that is, multiply in
  the sense of</span> <span m=''320000''>rabbits, that after a while, if you keep
  using different</span> <span m=''324000''>letters for each new idea, you can''t
  figure out what</span> <span m=''327000''>you''re talking about. So, I''ll use y1
  means,</span> <span m=''332000''>it''s a solution of this differential equation.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''337000''>Of course, the differential equation has many solutions</span>
  <span m=''343000''>containing an arbitrary constant.</span> </p><p><span m=''346000''>So,
  we''ll call this the solution.</span> </p><p><span m=''350000''>Now, the geometric
  view, the geometric guy that</span> <span m=''354000''>corresponds to this version
  of writing the equation,</span> <span m=''360000''>is something called a direction
  field.</span> </p><p><span m=''366000''>And, the solution is, from the geometric
  point of</span> <span m=''369000''>view, something called an integral curve.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''372000''>So, let me explain if you don''t know what the direction
  field</span> <span m=''376000''>is. I know for some of you,</span> <span m=''378000''>I''m
  reviewing what you learned in high school.</span> </p><p><span m=''381000''>Those
  of you who had the BC syllabus in high school should</span> <span m=''385000''>know
  these things. But, it never hurts to get a</span> <span m=''388000''>little more
  practice. And, in any event,</span> <span m=''391000''>I think the computer stuff
  that you will be doing on the problem</span> <span m=''396000''>set, a certain amount
  of it should be novel to you.</span> </p><p><span m=''401000''>It was novel to me,
  so why not to you?</span> </p><p><span m=''403000''>So, what''s a direction field?
  Well, the direction field is,</span> <span m=''407000''>you take the plane, and
  in each point of the</span> <span m=''411000''>plane-- of course, that''s an impossibility.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''414000''>But, you pick some points of the plane.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''416000''>You draw what''s called a little line element.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''421000''>So, there is a point. It''s a little line,</span> <span m=''424000''>and
  the only thing which distinguishes it outside of its</span> <span m=''428000''>position
  in the plane, so here''s the point,</span> <span m=''431000''>(x,y), at which we
  are drawing this line element,</span> <span m=''435000''>is its slope. And, what
  is its slope?</span> </p><p><span m=''438000''>Its slope is to be f of x,y.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''441000''>And now, You fill up the plane with these things until
  you''re</span> <span m=''446000''>tired of putting then in. So, I''m going to get
  tired</span> <span m=''450000''>pretty quickly. So, I don''t know,</span> <span
  m=''454000''>let''s not make them all go the same way.</span> </p><p><span m=''456000''>That
  sort of seems cheating. How about here?</span> </p><p><span m=''460000''>Here''s
  a few randomly chosen line elements that I put in,</span> <span m=''464000''>and
  I putted the slopes at random since I didn''t have any</span> <span m=''468000''>particular
  differential equation in mind.</span> </p><p><span m=''470000''>Now, the integral
  curve, so those are the line elements.</span> </p><p><span m=''474000''>The integral
  curve is a curve, which goes through the plane,</span> <span m=''478000''>and at
  every point is tangent to the line element there.</span> </p><p><span m=''484000''>So,
  this is the integral curve. Hey, wait a minute,</span> <span m=''487000''>I thought
  tangents were the line element there didn''t even</span> <span m=''492000''>touch
  it. Well, I can''t fill up the plane</span> <span m=''495000''>with line elements.
  Here, at this point,</span> <span m=''497000''>there was a line element, which I
  didn''t bother drawing</span> <span m=''502000''>in. And, it was tangent to that.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''504000''>Same thing over here: if I drew the line element</span>
  <span m=''507000''>here, I would find that the curve had exactly the right</span>
  <span m=''511000''>slope there. So, the point is the integral,</span> <span m=''517000''>what
  distinguishes the integral curve is that everywhere it has</span> <span m=''523000''>the
  direction, that''s the way I''ll indicate</span> <span m=''527000''>that it''s tangent,
  has the direction of the field</span> <span m=''532000''>everywhere at all points
  on the curve, of course,</span> <span m=''537000''>where it doesn''t go. It doesn''t
  have any mission to</span> <span m=''542000''>fulfill. Now, I say that this integral</span>
  <span m=''544000''>curve is the graph of the solution to the differential</span>
  <span m=''548000''>equation. In other words,</span> <span m=''550000''>writing down
  analytically the differential equation is the</span> <span m=''554000''>same geometrically
  as drawing this direction field,</span> <span m=''558000''>and solving analytically
  for a solution of the differential</span> <span m=''562000''>equation is the same
  thing as geometrically drawing an</span> <span m=''566000''>integral curve. So,
  what am I saying?</span> </p><p><span m=''570000''>I say that an integral curve,
  all right, let me write it this</span> <span m=''579000''>way. I''ll make a little
  theorem out</span> <span m=''584000''>of it, that y1 of x is a solution to the differential</span>
  <span m=''593000''>equation if, and only if, the graph, the curve associated</span>
  <span m=''601000''>with this, the graph of y1 of x is an integral curve.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''611000''>Integral curve of what? Well, of the direction field</span>
  <span m=''614000''>associated with that equation. But there isn''t quite enough</span>
  <span m=''618000''>room to write that on the board. But, you could put it in your</span>
  <span m=''622000''>notes, if you take notes. So, this is the relation</span> <span
  m=''625000''>between the two, the integral curves of the</span> <span m=''628000''>graphs
  or solutions. Now, why is that so?</span> </p><p><span m=''631000''>Well, in fact,
  all I have to do to prove this,</span> <span m=''634000''>if you can call it a proof
  at all, is simply to translate what</span> <span m=''638000''>each side really means.
  What does it really mean to say</span> <span m=''642000''>that a given function
  is a solution to the differential</span> <span m=''645000''>equation? Well, it means
  that if you plug</span> <span m=''648000''>it into the differential equation, it
  satisfies it.</span> </p><p><span m=''652000''>Okay, what is that? So, how do I
  plug it into the</span> <span m=''655000''>differential equation and check that
  it satisfies it?</span> </p><p><span m=''660000''>Well, doing it in the abstract,
  I first calculate its</span> <span m=''664000''>derivative. And then, how will it
  look</span> <span m=''667000''>after I plugged it into the differential equation?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''672000''>Well, I don''t do anything to the x, but wherever I see
  y,</span> <span m=''677000''>I plug in this particular function.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''680000''>So, in notation, that would be written this way.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''684000''>So, for this to be a solution means this, that that equation</span>
  <span m=''689000''>is satisfied. Okay, what does it mean for the</span> <span m=''695000''>graph
  to be an integral curve? Well, it means that at each</span> <span m=''702000''>point,
  the slope of this curve, it means that the slope of y1</span> <span m=''709000''>of
  x should be, at each point, x1 y1.</span> </p><p><span m=''712000''>It should be
  equal to the slope</span> <span m=''718000''>of the direction field at that point.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''724000''>And then, what is the slope of the direction field at
  that</span> <span m=''728000''>point? Well, it is f of that</span> <span m=''730000''>particular,
  well, at the point,</span> <span m=''732000''>x, y1 of x. If you like,</span> <span
  m=''735000''>you can put a subscript, one, on there,</span> <span m=''738000''>send
  a one here or a zero there, to indicate that you mean</span> <span m=''742000''>a
  particular point. But, it looks better if you</span> <span m=''746000''>don''t.
  But, there''s some possibility</span> <span m=''748000''>of confusion. I admit to
  that.</span> </p><p><span m=''752000''>So, the slope of the direction field, what
  is that slope?</span> </p><p><span m=''755000''>Well, by the way, I calculated the
  direction</span> <span m=''758000''>field. Its slope at the point was to</span>
  <span m=''761000''>be x, whatever the value of x was, and whatever the value of</span>
  <span m=''765000''>y1 of x was, substituted into the right-hand</span> <span m=''769000''>side
  of the equation. So, what the slope of this</span> <span m=''772000''>function of
  that curve of the graph should be equal to the</span> <span m=''776000''>slope of
  the direction field. Now, what does this say?</span> </p><p><span m=''781000''>Well,
  what''s the slope of y1 of x?</span> </p><p><span m=''783000''>That''s y1 prime
  of x.</span> </p><p><span m=''785000''>That''s from the first day of 18.01, calculus.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''788000''>What''s the slope of the direction field?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''791000''>This? Well, it''s this.</span> </p><p><span m=''792000''>And, that''s
  with the right hand side.</span> </p><p><span m=''794000''>So, saying these two
  guys are the same or equal,</span> <span m=''797000''>is exactly, analytically,
  the same as saying these two</span> <span m=''801000''>guys are equal. So, in other
  words,</span> <span m=''803000''>the proof consists of, what does this really mean?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''806000''>What does this really mean? And after you see what both</span>
  <span m=''809000''>really mean, you say, yeah, they''re the same.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''814000''>So, I don''t how to write that. It''s okay: same,</span> <span m=''819000''>same,
  how''s that? This is the same as that.</span> </p><p><span m=''824000''>Okay, well,
  this leaves us the interesting question of how do</span> <span m=''832000''>you
  draw a direction from the, well, this being 2003,</span> <span m=''838000''>mostly
  computers draw them for you.</span> </p><p><span m=''844000''>Nonetheless, you do
  have to know a certain</span> <span m=''847000''>amount. I''ve given you a couple
  of</span> <span m=''849000''>exercises where you have to draw the direction field
  yourself.</span> </p><p><span m=''854000''>This is so you get a feeling for it,
  and also because humans</span> <span m=''859000''>don''t draw direction fields the
  same way computers do.</span> </p><p><span m=''863000''>So, let''s first of all,
  how did computers do it?</span> </p><p><span m=''867000''>They are very stupid.
  There''s no problem.</span> </p><p><span m=''872000''>Since they go very fast and
  have unlimited amounts of energy</span> <span m=''877000''>to waste, the computer
  method is the naive one.</span> </p><p><span m=''882000''>You pick the point. You
  pick a point,</span> <span m=''885000''>and generally, they are usually equally</span>
  <span m=''889000''>spaced. You determine some spacing,</span> <span m=''892000''>that
  one: blah, blah, blah, blah,</span> <span m=''895000''>blah, blah, blah, equally
  spaced.</span> </p><p><span m=''900000''>And, at each point, it computes f of x,</span>
  <span m=''904000''>y at the point, finds, meets,</span> <span m=''908000''>and computes
  the value of f of (x, y), that function,</span> <span m=''914000''>and the next
  thing is, on the screen,</span> <span m=''917000''>it draws, at (x, y), the little
  line element</span> <span m=''922000''>having slope f of x,y.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''926000''>In other words, it does what the differential</span> <span m=''930000''>equation
  tells it to do. And the only thing that it does</span> <span m=''936000''>is you
  can, if you are telling the thing to draw the direction</span> <span m=''940000''>field,
  about the only option you have is telling what the spacing</span> <span m=''943000''>should
  be, and sometimes people don''t like to see a whole line.</span> </p><p><span m=''946000''>They
  only like to see a little bit of a half line.</span> </p><p><span m=''949000''>And,
  you can sometimes tell, according to the program,</span> <span m=''952000''>tell
  the computer how long you want that line to be,</span> <span m=''955000''>if you
  want it teeny or a little bigger.</span> </p><p><span m=''957000''>Once in awhile
  you want you want it narrower on it,</span> <span m=''960000''>but not right now.
  Okay, that''s what a computer</span> <span m=''964000''>does. What does a human
  do?</span> </p><p><span m=''965000''>This is what it means to be human.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''968000''>You use your intelligence. From a human point of view,</span> <span
  m=''972000''>this stuff has been done in the wrong order.</span> </p><p><span m=''975000''>And
  the reason it''s been done in the wrong order:</span> <span m=''978000''>because
  for each new point, it requires a recalculation of</span> <span m=''982000''>f of
  (x, y).</span> </p><p><span m=''984000''>That is horrible. The computer doesn''t
  mind,</span> <span m=''987000''>but a human does. So, for a human,</span> <span
  m=''991000''>the way to do it is not to begin by picking the point,</span> <span
  m=''995000''>but to begin by picking the slope that you would like to</span> <span
  m=''1000000''>see. So, you begin by taking the</span> <span m=''1002000''>slope.
  Let''s call it the value of the</span> <span m=''1005000''>slope, C. So, you pick
  a number.</span> </p><p><span m=''1008000''>C is two. I want to see where are all
  the</span> <span m=''1011000''>points in the plane where the slope of that line
  element would</span> <span m=''1016000''>be two? Well, they will satisfy an</span>
  <span m=''1018000''>equation. The equation is f of (x,</span> <span m=''1022000''>y)
  equals, in general, it will be C.</span> </p><p><span m=''1027000''>So, what you
  do is plot this, plot the equation,</span> <span m=''1030000''>plot this equation.
  Notice, it''s not the</span> <span m=''1034000''>differential equation. You can''t
  exactly plot a</span> <span m=''1037000''>differential equation. It''s a curve,</span>
  <span m=''1040000''>an ordinary curve. But which curve will depend;</span> <span
  m=''1044000''>it''s, in fact, from the 18.02 point of view,</span> <span m=''1048000''>the
  level curve of C, sorry, it''s a level curve of f</span> <span m=''1052000''>of
  (x, y), the function f of x and y corresponding to the level</span> <span m=''1057000''>of
  value C. But we are not going to call it</span> <span m=''1062000''>that because
  this is not 18.02. Instead, we''re going to call it</span> <span m=''1068000''>an
  isocline. And then, you plot,</span> <span m=''1071000''>well, you''ve done it.
  So, you''ve got this isocline,</span> <span m=''1076000''>except I''m going to use
  a solution curve,</span> <span m=''1080000''>solid lines, only for integral curves.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1083000''>When we do plot isoclines, to indicate that they are
  not</span> <span m=''1089000''>solutions, we''ll use dashed lines for doing them.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1095000''>One of the computer things does and the other one doesn''t.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1098000''>But they use different colors, also.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1100000''>There are different ways of telling you what''s an isocline</span>
  <span m=''1103000''>and what''s the solution curve. So, and what do you do?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1106000''>So, these are all the points where the slope is going
  to be</span> <span m=''1109000''>C. And now, what you do is draw in</span> <span
  m=''1112000''>as many as you want of line elements having slope C.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1115000''>Notice how efficient that is. If you want 50 million of them</span>
  <span m=''1119000''>and have the time, draw in 50 million.</span> </p><p><span m=''1121000''>If
  two or three are enough, draw in two or three.</span> </p><p><span m=''1125000''>You
  will be looking at the picture.</span> </p><p><span m=''1127000''>You will see what
  the curve looks like, and that will give</span> <span m=''1131000''>you your judgment
  as to how you are to do that.</span> </p><p><span m=''1134000''>So, in general,
  a picture drawn that way,</span> <span m=''1137000''>so let''s say, an isocline
  corresponding to C</span> <span m=''1139000''>equals zero. The line elements,</span>
  <span m=''1143000''>and I think for an isocline, for the purposes of this</span>
  <span m=''1147000''>lecture, it would be a good idea to put isoclines.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1150000''>Okay, so I''m going to put solution curves in pink,</span> <span m=''1154000''>or
  whatever this color is, and isoclines are going to be</span> <span m=''1158000''>in
  orange, I guess. So, isocline,</span> <span m=''1161000''>represented by a dashed
  line, and now you will put in the</span> <span m=''1165000''>line elements of, we''ll
  need lots of chalk for</span> <span m=''1168000''>that. So, I''ll use white chalk.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1172000''>Y horizontal? Because according to this the</span> <span
  m=''1174000''>slope is supposed to be zero there.</span> </p><p><span m=''1177000''>And
  at the same way, how about an isocline where the</span> <span m=''1180000''>slope
  is negative one? Let''s suppose here C is equal</span> <span m=''1184000''>to negative
  one. Okay, then it will look like</span> <span m=''1187000''>this. These are supposed
  to be lines</span> <span m=''1189000''>of slope negative one. Don''t shoot me if
  they are not.</span> </p><p><span m=''1193000''>So, that''s the principle. So, this
  is how you will fill</span> <span m=''1196000''>up the plane to draw a direction
  field: by plotting the isoclines</span> <span m=''1201000''>first. And then, once
  you have the</span> <span m=''1204000''>isoclines there, you will have line elements.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1207000''>And you can draw a direction field.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1209000''>Okay, so, for the next few minutes, I''d like to work a</span> <span
  m=''1212000''>couple of examples for you to show how this works out in</span> <span
  m=''1215000''>practice.</span> </p><p><span m=''1234000''>So, the first equation
  is going to be y prime equals minus x</span> <span m=''1245000''>over y. Okay, first
  thing,</span> <span m=''1253000''>what are the isoclines? Well, the isoclines are
  going</span> <span m=''1263000''>to be y. Well, negative x over y is</span> <span
  m=''1268000''>equal to C. Maybe I better make two steps</span> <span m=''1272000''>out
  of this. Minus x over y is equal to C.</span> </p><p><span m=''1276000''>But, of
  course, nobody draws a curve in that</span> <span m=''1279000''>form. You''ll want
  it in the form y</span> <span m=''1282000''>equals minus one over C times x.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1286000''>So, there''s our isocline. Why don''t I put that up in</span>
  <span m=''1292000''>orange since it''s going to be, that''s the color I''ll draw
  it</span> <span m=''1296000''>in. In other words,</span> <span m=''1298000''>for
  different values of C, now this thing is aligned.</span> </p><p><span m=''1302000''>It''s
  aligned, in fact, through the origin.</span> </p><p><span m=''1305000''>This looks
  pretty simple. Okay, so here''s our plane.</span> </p><p><span m=''1310000''>The
  isoclines are going to be lines through the origin.</span> </p><p><span m=''1314000''>And
  now, let''s put them in, suppose, for example,</span> <span m=''1318000''>C is equal
  to one. Well, if C is equal to one,</span> <span m=''1326000''>then it''s the line,
  y equals minus x.</span> </p><p><span m=''1334000''>So, this is the isocline. I''ll
  put, down here,</span> <span m=''1343000''>C equals minus one. And, along it,</span>
  <span m=''1350000''>no, something''s wrong. I''m sorry?</span> </p><p><span m=''1358000''>C
  is one, not negative one, right, thanks.</span> </p><p><span m=''1362000''>Thanks.
  So, C equals one.</span> </p><p><span m=''1364000''>So, it should be little line
  segments of slope one will be</span> <span m=''1370000''>the line elements, things
  of slope one.</span> </p><p><span m=''1374000''>OK, now how about C equals negative
  one?</span> </p><p><span m=''1380000''>If C equals negative one, then it''s the
  line,</span> <span m=''1383000''>y equals x. And so, that''s the isocline.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1387000''>Notice, still dash because these are isoclines.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1391000''>Here, C is negative one. And so, the slope elements look</span>
  <span m=''1395000''>like this. Notice, they are perpendicular.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1399000''>Now, notice that they are always going to be perpendicular</span>
  <span m=''1403000''>to the line because the slope of this line is minus one over
  C.</span> </p><p><span m=''1410000''>But, the slope of the line element is going
  to be C.</span> </p><p><span m=''1413000''>Those numbers, minus one over C and C,</span>
  <span m=''1416000''>are negative reciprocals. And, you know that two lines</span>
  <span m=''1420000''>whose slopes are negative reciprocals are perpendicular.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1424000''>So, the line elements are going to be perpendicular to
  these.</span> </p><p><span m=''1429000''>And therefore, I hardly even have to bother</span>
  <span m=''1432000''>calculating, doing any more calculation.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1435000''>Here''s going to be a, well, how about this one?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1440000''>Here''s a controversial isocline.</span> </p><p><span m=''1442000''>Is
  that an isocline? Well, wait a minute.</span> </p><p><span m=''1445000''>That doesn''t
  correspond to anything looking like this.</span> </p><p><span m=''1450000''>Ah-ha,
  but it would if I put C multiplied through by C.</span> </p><p><span m=''1454000''>And
  then, it would correspond to C being zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''1458000''>In
  other words, don''t write it like this.</span> </p><p><span m=''1461000''>Multiply
  through by C. It will read C y equals</span> <span m=''1465000''>negative x. And
  then, when C is zero,</span> <span m=''1469000''>I have x equals zero, which is
  exactly the y-axis.</span> </p><p><span m=''1475000''>So, that really is included.
  How about the x-axis?</span> </p><p><span m=''1478000''>Well, the x-axis is not
  included.</span> </p><p><span m=''1480000''>However, most people include it anyway.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1483000''>This is very common to be a sort of sloppy and bending
  the</span> <span m=''1487000''>edges of corners a little bit, and hoping nobody
  will notice.</span> </p><p><span m=''1491000''>We''ll say that corresponds to C
  equals infinity.</span> </p><p><span m=''1495000''>I hope nobody wants to fight
  about that.</span> </p><p><span m=''1498000''>If you do, go fight with somebody
  else.</span> </p><p><span m=''1502000''>So, if C is infinity, that means the little
  line</span> <span m=''1505000''>segment should have infinite slope, and by common
  consent,</span> <span m=''1510000''>that means it should be vertical.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1512000''>And so, we can even count this as sort of an isocline.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1517000''>And, I''ll make the dashes smaller, indicate it has a lower</span>
  <span m=''1521000''>status than the others. And, I''ll put this in,</span> <span
  m=''1525000''>do this weaselly thing of putting it in quotation marks to</span>
  <span m=''1529000''>indicate that I''m not responsible for it.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1534000''>Okay, now, we now have to put it the integral curves.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1539000''>Well, nothing could be easier. I''m looking for curves which</span>
  <span m=''1545000''>are everywhere perpendicular to these rays.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1550000''>Well, you know from geometry that those are circles.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1555000''>So, the integral curves are circles.</span> </p><p><span m=''1560000''>And,
  it''s an elementary exercise, which I would not</span> <span m=''1564000''>deprive
  you of the pleasure of. Solve the ODE by separation of</span> <span m=''1568000''>variables.
  In other words,</span> <span m=''1570000''>we''ve gotten the, so the circles are
  ones with a</span> <span m=''1574000''>center at the origin, of course, equal some
  constant.</span> </p><p><span m=''1578000''>I''ll call it C1, so it''s not confused
  with this</span> <span m=''1582000''>C. They look like that,</span> <span m=''1584000''>and
  now you should solve this by separating variables,</span> <span m=''1588000''>and
  just confirm that the solutions are,</span> <span m=''1591000''>in fact, those circles.
  One interesting thing,</span> <span m=''1596000''>and so I confirm this, I won''t
  do it because I want to</span> <span m=''1600000''>do geometric and numerical things
  today.</span> </p><p><span m=''1602000''>So, if you solve it by separating variables,</span>
  <span m=''1605000''>one interesting thing to note is that if I write the solution</span>
  <span m=''1609000''>as y equals y1 of x, well,</span> <span m=''1612000''>it''ll
  look something like the square root of C1 minus,</span> <span m=''1616000''>let''s
  make this squared because that''s the way people usually</span> <span m=''1620000''>put
  the radius, minus x squared.</span> </p><p><span m=''1623000''>And so, a solution,</span>
  <span m=''1626000''>a typical solution looks like this.</span> </p><p><span m=''1629000''>Well,
  what''s the solution over here?</span> </p><p><span m=''1631000''>Well, that one
  solution will be goes from here to here.</span> </p><p><span m=''1635000''>If you
  like, it has a negative side to it.</span> </p><p><span m=''1638000''>So, I''ll
  make, let''s say, plus.</span> </p><p><span m=''1641000''>There''s another solution,
  which has a negative value.</span> </p><p><span m=''1645000''>But let''s use the
  one with the positive value of the square</span> <span m=''1649000''>root. My point
  is this,</span> <span m=''1652000''>that that solution, the domain of that solution,</span>
  <span m=''1655000''>really only goes from here to here.</span> </p><p><span m=''1658000''>It''s
  not the whole x-axis. It''s just a limited piece of</span> <span m=''1662000''>the
  x-axis where that solution is defined.</span> </p><p><span m=''1665000''>There''s
  no way of extending it further.</span> </p><p><span m=''1668000''>And, there''s
  no way of predicting, by looking at the</span> <span m=''1672000''>differential
  equation, that a typical solution was</span> <span m=''1676000''>going to have a
  limited domain like that.</span> </p><p><span m=''1681000''>In other words, you
  could find a solution,</span> <span m=''1684000''>but how far out is it going to
  go?</span> </p><p><span m=''1687000''>Sometimes, it''s impossible to tell, except
  by either finding</span> <span m=''1692000''>it explicitly, or by asking a computer
  to draw</span> <span m=''1696000''>a picture of it, and seeing if that gives you</span>
  <span m=''1699000''>some insight. It''s one of the many</span> <span m=''1702000''>difficulties
  in handling differential equations.</span> </p><p><span m=''1706000''>You don''t
  know what the domain of a solution is going to be</span> <span m=''1711000''>until
  you''ve actually calculated it.</span> </p><p><span m=''1716000''>Now, a slightly
  more complicated example is going to</span> <span m=''1720000''>be, let''s see,
  y prime equals one plus x minus y.</span> </p><p><span m=''1723000''>It''s not a
  lot more</span> <span m=''1726000''>complicated, and as a computer exercise, you
  will work with,</span> <span m=''1731000''>still, more complicated ones. But here,
  the isoclines would</span> <span m=''1736000''>be what? Well, I set that equal to
  C.</span> </p><p><span m=''1740000''>Can you do the algebra in your head?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1742000''>An isocline will have the equation: this equals C.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1747000''>So, I''m going to put the y on the right hand side,</span>
  <span m=''1751000''>and that C on the left hand side.</span> </p><p><span m=''1753000''>So,
  it will have the equation y equals one plus x minus C,</span> <span m=''1759000''>or
  a nicer way to write it would be x plus one</span> <span m=''1763000''>minus C.
  I guess it really doesn''t</span> <span m=''1768000''>matter. So there''s the equation
  of the</span> <span m=''1771000''>isocline. Let''s quickly draw the</span> <span
  m=''1774000''>direction field. And notice, by the way,</span> <span m=''1776000''>it''s
  a simple equation, but you cannot separate</span> <span m=''1779000''>variables.
  So, I will not,</span> <span m=''1781000''>today at any rate, be able to check the
  answer.</span> </p><p><span m=''1784000''>I will not be able to get an analytic
  answer.</span> </p><p><span m=''1787000''>All we''ll be able to do now is get a
  geometric answer.</span> </p><p><span m=''1790000''>But notice how quickly, relatively
  quickly,</span> <span m=''1793000''>one can get it. So, I''m feeling for how the</span>
  <span m=''1796000''>solutions behave to this equation.</span> </p><p><span m=''1800000''>All
  right, let''s see, what should we plot first?</span> </p><p><span m=''1805000''>I
  like C equals one, no, don''t do C equals one.</span> </p><p><span m=''1810000''>Let''s
  do C equals zero, first.</span> </p><p><span m=''1813000''>C equals zero. That''s
  the line.</span> </p><p><span m=''1816000''>y equals x plus 1.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1819000''>Okay, let me run and get that chalk.</span> </p><p><span m=''1823000''>So,
  I''ll isoclines are in orange.</span> </p><p><span m=''1827000''>If so, when C equals
  zero, y equals x plus one.</span> </p><p><span m=''1832000''>So, let''s say it''s
  this curve. C equals zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''1838000''>How about C equals
  negative one?</span> </p><p><span m=''1842000''>Then it''s y equals x plus two.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1847000''>It''s this curve. Well, let''s label it down here.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1853000''>So, this is C equals negative one.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1857000''>C equals negative two would be y equals x, no,</span> <span m=''1862000''>what
  am I doing? C equals negative one is y</span> <span m=''1868000''>equals x plus
  two. That''s right.</span> </p><p><span m=''1872000''>Well, how about the other
  side? If C equals plus one,</span> <span m=''1876000''>well, then it''s going to
  go through the origin.</span> </p><p><span m=''1880000''>It looks like a little
  more room down here.</span> </p><p><span m=''1884000''>How about, so if this is
  going to be C equals one,</span> <span m=''1888000''>then I sort of get the idea.
  C equals two will look like</span> <span m=''1894000''>this. They''re all going
  to be</span> <span m=''1897000''>parallel lines because all that''s changing is
  the</span> <span m=''1902000''>y-intercept, as I do this thing. So, here, it''s
  C equals two.</span> </p><p><span m=''1907000''>That''s probably enough. All right,
  let''s put it in the</span> <span m=''1913000''>line elements. All right, C equals
  negative</span> <span m=''1917000''>one. These will be perpendicular.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1920000''>C equals zero, like this.</span> </p><p><span m=''1924000''>C equals
  one. Oh, this is interesting.</span> </p><p><span m=''1926000''>I can''t even draw
  in the line elements because they seem to</span> <span m=''1930000''>coincide with
  the curve itself, with the line itself.</span> </p><p><span m=''1934000''>They write
  y along the line, and that makes it hard to draw</span> <span m=''1938000''>them
  in. How about C equals two?</span> </p><p><span m=''1940000''>Well, here, the line
  elements will be slanty.</span> </p><p><span m=''1943000''>They''ll have slope two,
  so a pretty slanty up.</span> </p><p><span m=''1946000''>And, I can see if a C equals
  three in the same way.</span> </p><p><span m=''1951000''>There are going to be even
  more slantier up.</span> </p><p><span m=''1954000''>And here, they''re going to
  be even more slanty down.</span> </p><p><span m=''1957000''>This is not very scientific
  terminology or mathematical,</span> <span m=''1961000''>but you get the idea. Okay,
  so there''s our quick</span> <span m=''1965000''>version of the direction field.
  All we have to do is put in</span> <span m=''1969000''>some integral curves now.
  Well, it looks like it''s doing</span> <span m=''1973000''>this. It gets less slanty
  here.</span> </p><p><span m=''1975000''>It levels out, has slope zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1979000''>And now, in this part of the plain, the slope seems to be</span> <span
  m=''1983000''>rising. So, it must do something like</span> <span m=''1986000''>that.
  This guy must do something like</span> <span m=''1988000''>this. I''m a little doubtful
  of what I</span> <span m=''1991000''>should be doing here. Or, how about going from
  the</span> <span m=''1995000''>other side? Well, it rises,</span> <span m=''1997000''>gets
  a little, should it cross this?</span> </p><p><span m=''2000000''>What should I
  do? Well, there''s one integral</span> <span m=''2003000''>curve, which is easy
  to see. It''s this one.</span> </p><p><span m=''2006000''>This line is both an isocline
  and an integral curve.</span> </p><p><span m=''2012000''>It''s everything, except
  drawable,</span> <span m=''2015000''>[LAUGHTER] so, you understand this is the same</span>
  <span m=''2021000''>line. It''s both orange and pink at</span> <span m=''2025000''>the
  same time. But I don''t know what</span> <span m=''2029000''>combination color that
  would make.</span> </p><p><span m=''2033000''>It doesn''t look like a line, but
  be sympathetic.</span> </p><p><span m=''2040000''>Now, the question is, what''s
  happening in this</span> <span m=''2044000''>corridor? In the corridor,</span> <span
  m=''2046000''>that''s not a mathematical word either, between the isoclines</span>
  <span m=''2052000''>for, well, what are they? They are the isoclines for C</span>
  <span m=''2058000''>equals two, and C equals zero. How does that corridor look?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2063000''>Well: something like this. Over here, the lines all look</span>
  <span m=''2069000''>like that. And here, they all look like</span> <span m=''2073000''>this.
  The slope is two.</span> </p><p><span m=''2076000''>And, a hapless solution gets
  in there.</span> </p><p><span m=''2079000''>What''s it to do? Well, do you see that
  if a</span> <span m=''2083000''>solution gets in that corridor, an integral curve
  gets in that</span> <span m=''2089000''>corridor, no escape is possible. It''s like
  a lobster trap.</span> </p><p><span m=''2094000''>The lobster can walk in. But it
  cannot walk out because</span> <span m=''2098000''>things are always going in. How
  could it escape?</span> </p><p><span m=''2103000''>Well, it would have to double
  back, somehow,</span> <span m=''2106000''>and remember, to escape, it has to be,</span>
  <span m=''2110000''>to escape on the left side, it must be going horizontally.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2117000''>But, how could it do that without doubling back first
  and</span> <span m=''2120000''>having the wrong slope? The slope of everything in
  this</span> <span m=''2124000''>corridor is positive, and to double back and escape,</span>
  <span m=''2128000''>it would at some point have to have negative slope.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2132000''>It can''t do that. Well, could it escape on the</span> <span m=''2135000''>right-hand
  side? No, because at the moment when</span> <span m=''2139000''>it wants to cross,
  it will have to have a slope</span> <span m=''2142000''>less than this line. But
  all these spiky guys are</span> <span m=''2146000''>pointing; it can''t escape that
  way either.</span> </p><p><span m=''2150000''>So, no escape is possible. It has
  to continue on,</span> <span m=''2153000''>there. But, more than that is true.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2156000''>So, a solution can''t escape. Once it''s in there,</span>
  <span m=''2161000''>it can''t escape. It''s like, what do they call</span> <span
  m=''2164000''>those plants, I forget, pitcher plants.</span> </p><p><span m=''2167000''>All
  they hear is they are going down.</span> </p><p><span m=''2170000''>So, it looks
  like that. And so, the poor little insect</span> <span m=''2174000''>falls in. They
  could climb up the walls</span> <span m=''2177000''>except that all the hairs are
  going the wrong direction,</span> <span m=''2182000''>and it can''t get over them.
  Well, let''s think of it that</span> <span m=''2186000''>way: this poor trap solution.
  So, it does what it has to do.</span> </p><p><span m=''2192000''>Now, there''s more
  to it than that.</span> </p><p><span m=''2195000''>Because there are two principles
  involved here that</span> <span m=''2199000''>you should know, that help a lot in
  drawing</span> <span m=''2203000''>these pictures. Principle number one is that</span>
  <span m=''2206000''>two integral curves cannot cross at an angle.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2210000''>Two integral curves can''t cross, I mean,</span> <span m=''2213000''>by
  crossing at an angle like that.</span> </p><p><span m=''2216000''>I''ll indicate
  what I mean by a picture like that.</span> </p><p><span m=''2222000''>Now, why not?
  This is an important principle.</span> </p><p><span m=''2225000''>Let''s put that
  up in the white box.</span> </p><p><span m=''2228000''>They can''t cross because
  if two integral curves,</span> <span m=''2232000''>are trying to cross, well, one
  will look like this.</span> </p><p><span m=''2236000''>It''s an integral curve because
  it has this slope.</span> </p><p><span m=''2240000''>And, the other integral curve
  has this slope.</span> </p><p><span m=''2244000''>And now, they fight with each
  other.</span> </p><p><span m=''2247000''>What is the true slope at that point?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2252000''>Well, the direction field only allows you to have one
  slope.</span> </p><p><span m=''2256000''>If there''s a line element at that point,
  it has a definite</span> <span m=''2260000''>slope. And therefore,</span> <span
  m=''2261000''>it cannot have both the slope and that one.</span> </p><p><span m=''2264000''>It''s
  as simple as that. So, the reason is you can''t</span> <span m=''2268000''>have
  two slopes. The direction field doesn''t</span> <span m=''2271000''>allow it. Well,
  that''s a big,</span> <span m=''2273000''>big help because if I know, here''s an
  integral curve,</span> <span m=''2277000''>and if I know that none of these other
  pink integral curves</span> <span m=''2281000''>are allowed to cross it, how else
  can I do it?</span> </p><p><span m=''2286000''>Well, they can''t escape. They can''t
  cross.</span> </p><p><span m=''2289000''>It''s sort of clear that they must get
  closer and closer to</span> <span m=''2293000''>it. You know, I''d have to work
  a</span> <span m=''2296000''>little to justify that. But I think that nobody would</span>
  <span m=''2300000''>have any doubt of it who did a little experimentation.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2304000''>In other words, all these curves joined that</span> <span
  m=''2308000''>little tube and get closer and closer to this line,</span> <span m=''2312000''>y
  equals x. And there, without solving the</span> <span m=''2317000''>differential
  equation, it''s clear that all of these</span> <span m=''2322000''>solutions, how
  do they behave? As x goes to infinity,</span> <span m=''2327000''>they become asymptotic
  to, they become closer and closer</span> <span m=''2332000''>to the solution, x.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2334000''>Is x a solution? Yeah, because y equals x is an</span>
  <span m=''2338000''>integral curve. Is x a solution?</span> </p><p><span m=''2342000''>Yeah,
  because if I plug in y equals x, I get what?</span> </p><p><span m=''2347000''>On
  the right-hand side, I get one.</span> </p><p><span m=''2350000''>And on the left-hand
  side, I get one.</span> </p><p><span m=''2354000''>One equals one. So, this is a
  solution.</span> </p><p><span m=''2358000''>Let''s indicate that it''s a solution.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2361000''>So, analytically, we''ve discovered an analytic</span>
  <span m=''2366000''>solution to the differential equation, namely,</span> <span
  m=''2371000''>Y equals X, just by this geometric process.</span> </p><p><span m=''2377000''>Now,
  there''s one more principle like that, which is less</span> <span m=''2381000''>obvious.
  But you do have to know it.</span> </p><p><span m=''2384000''>So, you are not allowed
  to cross.</span> </p><p><span m=''2386000''>That''s clear. But it''s much,</span>
  <span m=''2389000''>much, much, much, much less obvious that two</span> <span m=''2392000''>integral
  curves cannot touch. That is, they cannot even be</span> <span m=''2397000''>tangent.
  Two integral curves cannot be</span> <span m=''2400000''>tangent.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2410000''>I''ll indicate that by the word touch, which is what a lot of</span>
  <span m=''2419000''>people say. In other words,</span> <span m=''2423000''>if this
  is illegal, so is this.</span> </p><p><span m=''2428000''>It can''t happen. You
  know, without that,</span> <span m=''2433000''>for example, it might be,</span>
  <span m=''2435000''>I might feel that there would be nothing in this to prevent</span>
  <span m=''2439000''>those curves from joining. Why couldn''t these pink curves</span>
  <span m=''2443000''>join the line, y equals x?</span> </p><p><span m=''2445000''>You
  know, it''s a solution. They just pitch a ride,</span> <span m=''2449000''>as it
  were. The answer is they cannot do</span> <span m=''2452000''>that because they
  have to just get asymptotic to it,</span> <span m=''2455000''>ever, ever closer.
  They can''t join y equals x</span> <span m=''2459000''>because at the point where
  they join, you have that situation.</span> </p><p><span m=''2465000''>Now, why can''t
  you to have this?</span> </p><p><span m=''2469000''>That''s much more sophisticated
  than this, and the reason is</span> <span m=''2477000''>because of something called
  the Existence and Uniqueness</span> <span m=''2484000''>Theorem, which says that
  there is through a point,</span> <span m=''2491000''>x zero y zero, that y prime
  equals f of</span> <span m=''2498000''>(x, y) has only one,</span> <span m=''2503000''>and
  only one solution. One has one solution.</span> </p><p><span m=''2509000''>In mathematics
  speak, that means at least one</span> <span m=''2513000''>solution. It doesn''t
  mean it has just one</span> <span m=''2516000''>solution. That''s mathematical convention.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2519000''>It has one solution, at least one solution.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2522000''>But, the killer is, only one solution.</span> </p><p><span m=''2526000''>That''s
  what you have to say in mathematics if you want just</span> <span m=''2530000''>one,
  one, and only one solution through the point</span> <span m=''2535000''>x zero y
  zero. So, the fact that it has one,</span> <span m=''2538000''>that is the existence
  part. The fact that it has only one</span> <span m=''2543000''>is the uniqueness
  part of the theorem.</span> </p><p><span m=''2546000''>Now, like all good mathematical
  theorems, this one does have</span> <span m=''2551000''>hypotheses. So, this is
  not going to be a</span> <span m=''2555000''>course, I warn you, those of you who
  are</span> <span m=''2559000''>theoretically inclined, very rich in hypotheses.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2564000''>But, hypotheses for those one or that f of (x,</span>
  <span m=''2568000''>y) should be a continuous function.</span> </p><p><span m=''2572000''>Now,
  like polynomial, signs, should be continuous</span> <span m=''2577000''>near, in
  the vicinity of that point.</span> </p><p><span m=''2582000''>That guarantees existence,
  and what guarantees uniqueness</span> <span m=''2588000''>is the hypothesis that
  you would not guess by yourself.</span> </p><p><span m=''2594000''>Neither would
  I. What guarantees the uniqueness</span> <span m=''2599000''>is that also, it''s
  partial derivative with</span> <span m=''2604000''>respect to y should be continuous,
  should be continuous</span> <span m=''2610000''>near x zero y zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2615000''>Well, I have to make a decision.</span> </p><p><span m=''2618000''>I
  don''t have time to talk about Euler''s method.</span> </p><p><span m=''2623000''>I''ll
  refer you to the, there''s one page of notes,</span> <span m=''2629000''>and I couldn''t
  do any more than just repeat what''s on those</span> <span m=''2635000''>notes.
  So, I''ll trust you to read</span> <span m=''2639000''>that. And instead,</span>
  <span m=''2642000''>let me give you an example which will solidify these things</span>
  <span m=''2649000''>in your mind a little bit. I think that''s a better course.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2657000''>The example is not in your notes, and therefore,</span>
  <span m=''2662000''>remember, you heard it here first.</span> </p><p><span m=''2667000''>Okay,
  so what''s the example? So, there is that differential</span> <span m=''2674000''>equation.
  Now, let''s just solve it by</span> <span m=''2678000''>separating variables. Can
  you do it in your head?</span> </p><p><span m=''2682000''>dy over dx, put all the
  y''s on the left.</span> </p><p><span m=''2684000''>It will look like dy over one
  minus y.</span> </p><p><span m=''2688000''>Put all the dx''s on the left. So, the
  dx here goes on the</span> <span m=''2692000''>right, rather. That will be dx.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2694000''>And then, the x goes down into the denominator.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2697000''>So now, it looks like that. And, if I integrate both
  sides,</span> <span m=''2703000''>I get the log of one minus y, I guess, maybe with
  a,</span> <span m=''2708000''>I never bothered with that, but you can.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2712000''>It should be absolute values. All right, put an absolute</span> <span
  m=''2717000''>value, plus a constant. And now, if I exponentiate both</span> <span
  m=''2723000''>sides, the constant is positive. So, this is going to look like</span>
  <span m=''2729000''>y. One minus y equals x</span> <span m=''2733000''>And, the
  constant will be e to</span> <span m=''2736000''>the C1. And, I''ll just make that
  a new</span> <span m=''2739000''>constant, Cx. And now, by letting C be</span> <span
  m=''2742000''>negative, that''s why you can get rid of the absolute values,</span>
  <span m=''2745000''>if you allow C to have negative values as well as positive</span>
  <span m=''2749000''>values. Let''s write this in a more</span> <span m=''2751000''>human
  form. So, y is equal to one minus Cx.</span> </p><p><span m=''2753000''>Good, all
  right,</span> <span m=''2755000''>let''s just plot those. So, these are the solutions.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2760000''>It''s a pretty easy equation, pretty easy solution method,</span>
  <span m=''2765000''>just separation of variables. What do they look like?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2771000''>Well, these are all lines whose intercept is at one.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2776000''>And, they have any slope whatsoever.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2779000''>So, these are the lines that look like that.</span> </p><p><span m=''2784000''>Okay,
  now let me ask, existence and uniqueness.</span> </p><p><span m=''2789000''>Existence:
  through which points of the plane does the solution</span> <span m=''2795000''>go?
  Answer: through every point of</span> <span m=''2799000''>the plane, through any
  point here, I can find one and only</span> <span m=''2804000''>one of those lines,
  except for these stupid guys</span> <span m=''2808000''>here on the stalk of the
  flower. Here, for each of these points,</span> <span m=''2813000''>there is no existence.
  There is no solution to this</span> <span m=''2817000''>differential equation, which
  goes through any of these</span> <span m=''2822000''>wiggly points on the y-axis,
  with one exception.</span> </p><p><span m=''2827000''>This point is oversupplied.
  At this point,</span> <span m=''2830000''>it''s not existence that fails. It''s
  uniqueness that fails:</span> <span m=''2834000''>no uniqueness. There are lots
  of things which</span> <span m=''2838000''>go through here. Now, is that a violation
  of the</span> <span m=''2841000''>existence and uniqueness theorem?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2844000''>It cannot be a violation because the theorem has no</span> <span m=''2848000''>exceptions.
  Otherwise, it wouldn''t be a</span> <span m=''2851000''>theorem. So, let''s take
  a look.</span> </p><p><span m=''2854000''>What''s wrong? We thought we solved it
  modulo,</span> <span m=''2857000''>putting the absolute value signs on the log.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2860000''>What''s wrong? The answer: what''s wrong is to</span>
  <span m=''2863000''>use the theorem you must write the differential equation in</span>
  <span m=''2868000''>standard form, in the green form I gave you.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2871000''>Let''s write the differential equation the way we were</span> <span
  m=''2874000''>supposed to. It says dy / dx equals one</span> <span m=''2877000''>minus
  y divided by x.</span> </p><p><span m=''2882000''>And now, I see, the right-hand
  side is not</span> <span m=''2885000''>continuous, in fact, not even defined when
  x equals</span> <span m=''2889000''>zero, when along the y-axis. And therefore,</span>
  <span m=''2892000''>the existence and uniqueness is not guaranteed along the line,</span>
  <span m=''2896000''>x equals zero of the y-axis. And, in fact,</span> <span m=''2900000''>we
  see that it failed. Now, as a practical matter,</span> <span m=''2903000''>it''s
  the way existence and uniqueness fails in all ordinary</span> <span m=''2908000''>life
  work with differential equations is not through</span> <span m=''2912000''>sophisticated
  examples that mathematicians can construct.</span> </p><p><span m=''2918000''>But
  normally, because f of (x,</span> <span m=''2920000''>y) will fail to be defined
  somewhere,</span> <span m=''2923000''>and those will be the bad points.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2926000''>Thanks.</span> </p>'
