title: 'Lecture 28: Matrix Methods for Inhomogeneous Systems'
transcript: <p><span m='7000'>The real topic is how to solve inhomogeneous systems,</span>
  <span m='11000'>but the subtext is what I wrote on the board.</span> </p><p><span
  m='14000'>I think you will see that really thinking in terms of</span> <span m='18000'>matrices
  makes certain things a lot easier than they would be</span> <span m='23000'>otherwise.
  And I hope to give you a couple</span> <span m='26000'>of examples of that today
  in connection with solving systems</span> <span m='30000'>of inhomogeneous equations.
  Now, there is a little problem.</span> </p><p><span m='36000'>We have to have a
  little bit of theory ahead of time before</span> <span m='41000'>that, which I thought
  rather than interrupt the presentation</span> <span m='47000'>as I try to talk about
  the inhomogeneous systems it would</span> <span m='51000'>be better to put a little
  theory in the beginning.</span> </p><p><span m='56000'>I think you will find it
  harmless.</span> </p><p><span m='60000'>And about half of it you know already.</span>
  </p><p><span m='63000'>The theory I am talking about is, in general,</span> <span
  m='67000'>the theory of the systems x prime equal a x.</span> </p><p><span m='71000'>I
  will just state it when n is equal to two.</span> </p><p><span m='75000'>A two-by-two
  system likely you have had up until now.</span> </p><p><span m='79000'>It is also
  true for end-by-end. It is just a little more</span> <span m='84000'>tedious to
  write out and to give the definitions.</span> </p><p><span m='90000'>Here is a little
  two-by-two system.</span> </p><p><span m='93000'>It is homogeneous. There are no
  zeros.</span> </p><p><span m='97000'>And it is not necessary to assume this, but
  since the</span> <span m='102000'>matrix is going to be constant until the end of
  the term let's</span> <span m='108000'>assume it in and not go for a spurious generality.</span>
  </p><p><span m='113000'>So constant matrices like you will have on your homework.</span>
  </p><p><span m='120000'>Now, there are two theorems, or maybe three that I want
  you</span> <span m='125000'>to know, that you need to know in order to understand
  what is</span> <span m='130000'>going on. The first one,</span> <span m='133000'>fortunately,
  is already in your bloodstream,</span> <span m='136000'>I hope. Let's call it theorem
  A.</span> </p><p><span m='139000'>It is simply the one that says that the general
  solution to the</span> <span m='145000'>system, that system I wrote on the board,
  the two-by-two system</span> <span m='151000'>is what you know it to be. Namely,
  from all the examples</span> <span m='156000'>that you have calculated. It is a
  linear combination with</span> <span m='160000'>arbitrary constants for the coefficients
  of two solutions.</span> </p><p><span m='164000'>In other words, to solve it,</span>
  <span m='166000'>to find the general solution you put all your energy into</span>
  <span m='169000'>finding two independent solutions.</span> </p><p><span m='172000'>And
  then, as soon as you found them, the general one is gotten</span> <span m='176000'>by
  combining those with arbitrary constants.</span> </p><p><span m='180000'>The only
  thing to specify is what the x1 and the x2 are.</span> </p><p><span m='184000'>"Where,"
  I guess, would be the right word to use.</span> </p><p><span m='188000'>Where x1
  and x2 are two solutions, but neither must be a</span> <span m='192000'>constant
  multiple of the other. That is the only thing I want</span> <span m='197000'>to
  stress, they have to be independent.</span> </p><p><span m='200000'>Or, as it is
  better to say, linearly independent.</span> </p><p><span m='204000'>Are two linearly
  independent solutions.</span> </p><p><span m='214000'>And department of fuller explanation,
  i.e.,</span> <span m='217000'>neither is a constant multiple of the other.</span>
  </p><p><span m='230000'>That is what it means to be linearly independent.</span>
  </p><p><span m='232000'>Now, this theorem I am not going to prove.</span> </p><p><span
  m='235000'>I am just going to say that the proof is a lot like the one for</span>
  <span m='239000'>second order equations. It has an easy part and a hard</span> <span
  m='243000'>part. The easy part is to show that</span> <span m='245000'>all of these
  guys are solutions. And, in fact,</span> <span m='248000'>that is almost self-evident
  by looking at the equation.</span> </p><p><span m='252000'>For example, if x1 and
  x2,</span> <span m='254000'>each of those solve that equation so does their sum</span>
  <span m='257000'>because, when you plug it in, you differentiate the sum by</span>
  <span m='261000'>differentiating each term and adding.</span> </p><p><span m='264000'>And
  here A times x1 plus x2 is Ax1 plus Ax2.</span> </p><p><span m='268000'>In other
  words,</span> <span m='271000'>you are using the linearity and the superposition
  principle.</span> </p><p><span m='276000'>It is easy to show that all of these,
  well, maybe I should</span> <span m='282000'>actually write something down instead
  of just talking.</span> </p><p><span m='287000'>Easy that all these are solutions.</span>
  </p><p><span m='290000'>Every one of those guys, regardless of what c1 and c2</span>
  <span m='295000'>is, is a solution. That is linearity,</span> <span m='299000'>if
  I use that buzz word, plus the superposition</span> <span m='302000'>principle,
  that the sum of two solutions is a solution.</span> </p><p><span m='312000'>The
  hard thing is not to show that these are solutions but to</span> <span m='316000'>show
  that these are all the solutions, that there are no</span> <span m='321000'>other
  solutions. No matter how you do that it is</span> <span m='324000'>hard. The hard
  thing is that there</span> <span m='327000'>are no other solutions. These are all.</span>
  </p><p><span m='331000'>Now, you could sort of say, well, it has two arbitrary</span>
  <span m='335000'>constants in it. That is sort of a rough and</span> <span m='338000'>ready
  reason, but it is not considered</span> <span m='341000'>adequate by mathematicians.
  And, in fact,</span> <span m='344000'>I could go into a song and dance as to just
  why it is</span> <span m='348000'>inadequate. But we have other things to do,</span>
  <span m='352000'>bigger fish to fry, as they say.</span> </p><p><span m='354000'>Let's
  fry a fish. No, we have another theorem</span> <span m='358000'>first. This one
  it is mostly the words</span> <span m='364000'>that I am interested in. Once again,
  we have our old</span> <span m='371000'>friend the Wronskian back. The Wronskian
  of what?</span> </p><p><span m='378000'>Of two solutions. It is the Wronskian of
  the</span> <span m='385000'>solution x1 and x2. They don't, by the way,</span> <span
  m='390000'>have to be independent. Just two solutions to the</span> <span m='394000'>system.
  And what is it?</span> </p><p><span m='396000'>Hey, didn't we already have a Wronskian?</span>
  </p><p><span m='399000'>Yeah. Forget about that one for the</span> <span m='402000'>moment.
  Postpone it for a minute.</span> </p><p><span m='405000'>This is a determinant,
  just like the old one way.</span> </p><p><span m='420000'>This is going to be a
  great lecture.</span> </p><p><span m='423000'>(x1, x2). Now what is this?</span>
  </p><p><span m='426000'>x1 is a column vector, right?</span> </p><p><span m='428000'>x2
  is a column vector. Two things in it.</span> </p><p><span m='432000'>Two things
  in it. Together they make a square</span> <span m='437000'>matrix. And this means
  it is</span> <span m='439000'>determinant. It is the determinant of this.</span>
  </p><p><span m='444000'>It is a determinant, in other words,</span> <span m='447000'>of
  a square matrix. And that is what it is.</span> </p><p><span m='452000'>I will change
  this equality. To indicate it is a definition,</span> <span m='457000'>I will put
  the colon there, which is what you add,</span> <span m='461000'>to indicate this
  is only equal because I say so.</span> </p><p><span m='464000'>It is a definition,
  in other words.</span> </p><p><span m='467000'>Now, there is a connection between
  this and the earlier</span> <span m='471000'>Wronskian which I, unfortunately,</span>
  <span m='474000'>cannot explain to you because you are going to explain it to</span>
  <span m='478000'>me. I gave it to you as part one of</span> <span m='482000'>your
  homework problem. Make sure you do it.</span> </p><p><span m='485000'>And, if you
  cannot remember what the old Wronskian is,</span> <span m='488000'>please look it
  up in the book. Don't look it up in the</span> <span m='492000'>solution to the
  problem. If you do that you will learn</span> <span m='496000'>something. Then you
  will see how,</span> <span m='498000'>in a certain sense, this is a more general</span>
  <span m='501000'>definition than I gave you before.</span> </p><p><span m='503000'>The
  one I gave you before is, in a certain sense,</span> <span m='507000'>a special
  case of it. Now that is just the</span> <span m='511000'>definition. There is a
  theorem.</span> </p><p><span m='514000'>And the theorem is going to look just like
  the one we had</span> <span m='519000'>for second order equations, if you can remember
  back that</span> <span m='523000'>far. The theorem is that if these</span> <span
  m='526000'>are two solutions there are only two possibilities for the</span> <span
  m='531000'>Wronskian. So either or.</span> </p><p><span m='533000'>Either the Wronskian
  is -- Now, the Wronskian,</span> <span m='538000'>these are functions, the column
  vectors are the</span> <span m='543000'>solutions, so those are functions of the
  variable t,</span> <span m='548000'>so are these. The Wronskian as a whole is a</span>
  <span m='552000'>function of the independent variable t after you have</span> <span
  m='558000'>calculated out that determinant. I will write it now this way to</span>
  <span m='564000'>indicate that it s a function of t.</span> </p><p><span m='568000'>Either
  the Wronskian is -- One possibility is identically</span> <span m='575000'>zero.
  That is zero for all values of</span> <span m='579000'>t, in other words. And this
  happens if x1 and x2</span> <span m='585000'>are not linearly independent. Usually
  people just say</span> <span m='591000'>dependent and hope they are interpreted
  correctly.</span> </p><p><span m='597000'>Are dependent. But since I did not explain</span>
  <span m='603000'>what dependent means, I will say it.</span> </p><p><span m='607000'>Not
  linearly independent. I know that is horrible,</span> <span m='612000'>but nobody
  has figured out another way to say it.</span> </p><p><span m='618000'>That is one
  possibility, or the opposite of this is</span> <span m='623000'>never zero for any
  t value. I mean a normal function is</span> <span m='629000'>zero here and there,
  and the rest of the time not</span> <span m='633000'>zero. Well, not this Wronskian.</span>
  </p><p><span m='635000'>You only have two choices. Either it is zero all the time</span>
  <span m='638000'>or it is never zero. It is like the function e to</span> <span
  m='642000'>the t. In other words,</span> <span m='643000'>an exponential which is
  never zero, always positive and never</span> <span m='648000'>zero. Or, it could
  be a constant.</span> </p><p><span m='650000'>Anyway, it has to be a function which
  is never zero.</span> </p><p><span m='653000'>And this happens in the other case,
  so this is --</span> <span m='658000'>There is no place to write it. This is the
  case if x1 and x2</span> <span m='665000'>are independent, by which I mean linearly</span>
  <span m='671000'>independent. It is just I didn't have room</span> <span m='676000'>to
  write it. That is pretty much the end of</span> <span m='682000'>the theory. And
  now, let's start in on the</span> <span m='687000'>matrices. The basic new matrix
  we are</span> <span m='691000'>going to be talking about this period and next one
  on Monday</span> <span m='695000'>also is the way that most people who work with
  systems actually</span> <span m='700000'>look at the solutions to systems, so it
  is important you</span> <span m='703000'>learn this word and this way of looking
  at it.</span> </p><p><span m='707000'>What they do is look not at each solution
  separately,</span> <span m='710000'>as we have been doing up until now.</span> </p><p><span
  m='712000'>They put them all together in a single matrix.</span> </p><p><span m='717000'>And
  it is the properties of that matrix that they study and</span> <span m='722000'>try
  to do the calculations using.</span> </p><p><span m='724000'>And that matrix is
  called the fundamental matrix for the</span> <span m='729000'>system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='737000'>Sometimes people don't bother writing in the whole system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='740000'>They just say it is a fundamental matrix for A</span> <span m='743000'>because,
  after all, A is the only thing that is</span> <span m='745000'>varying there. Once
  you know A,</span> <span m='747000'>you know what the system is. So what is this
  guy?</span> </p><p><span m='751000'>Well, it is a two-by-two matrix.</span> </p><p><span
  m='753000'>And it is the most harmless thing.</span> </p><p><span m='755000'>It
  is the precursor of the Wronskian.</span> </p><p><span m='758000'>It is what the
  Wronskian was before the determinant was</span> <span m='762000'>taken. In other
  words,</span> <span m='764000'>it is the matrix whose two columns are those two
  solutions.</span> </p><p><span m='768000'>The other question is what we are going
  to call it.</span> </p><p><span m='772000'>I kept trying everything and settled
  on calling it capital X</span> <span m='776000'>because I think that is the one
  that guides you in the</span> <span m='780000'>calculations the best. This is definition
  two,</span> <span m='786000'>so colon equality. Notice I am not using vertical</span>
  <span m='790000'>lines now because that would mean a determinant.</span> </p><p><span
  m='795000'>It is the matrix whose columns are two independent solutions.</span>
  </p><p><span m='814000'>Is that all? Yeah.</span> </p><p><span m='815000'>You just
  put them side-by-side. Why?</span> </p><p><span m='818000'>That will come out. Why
  should one do this?</span> </p><p><span m='821000'>Well, first of all, in order
  not to interrupt the</span> <span m='825000'>basic calculation that I want to make
  with this during the</span> <span m='830000'>period, it has two basic properties
  that we are going to</span> <span m='834000'>need during this period. These are
  the properties.</span> </p><p><span m='840000'>Just two. And one is obvious and
  the</span> <span m='842000'>other you will think, I hope, is a little less</span>
  <span m='846000'>familiar. I think you will see there is</span> <span m='849000'>nothing
  to it. It is just a way of talking,</span> <span m='853000'>really. The first is
  the one that is</span> <span m='856000'>already embedded in the theorem, namely
  that the determinant of</span> <span m='861000'>the fundamental matrix is not zero
  for any t.</span> </p><p><span m='864000'>Why? Well, I just told you it</span> <span
  m='867000'>wasn't. This is the Wronskian.</span> </p><p><span m='871000'>The Wronskian
  is never zero? Why is it never zero?</span> </p><p><span m='875000'>Well, because
  I said these columns had to be independent</span> <span m='880000'>solutions. So
  this is not just not zero,</span> <span m='884000'>it is never zero. It is not zero
  for any value of</span> <span m='888000'>t. That is good.</span> </p><p><span m='890000'>As
  you will see, we are going to need that</span> <span m='894000'>property. But the
  other one is a little</span> <span m='897000'>stranger. The only thing I can say
  is,</span> <span m='902000'>get used to it. Namely that X prime equals AX.</span>
  </p><p><span m='906000'>Now, why is that strange? That is not the same as this.</span>
  </p><p><span m='911000'>This is a column vector. That is a square matrix and</span>
  <span m='915000'>this is a column vector. This is not a column vector.</span> </p><p><span
  m='920000'>This is a square matrix. This is what is called a matrix</span> <span
  m='926000'>differential equation where the variable is not a single x or a</span>
  <span m='932000'>column vector of a set of x's like the x and the y.</span> </p><p><span
  m='937000'>It is a whole matrix.</span> </p><p><span m='950000'>Well, first of all,
  I should say what is it saying?</span> </p><p><span m='953000'>This is a two-by-two
  matrix. When I multiply them I get a</span> <span m='958000'>two-by-two matrix.
  What is this?</span> </p><p><span m='960000'>This is a two-by-two matrix, every
  entry of which has been</span> <span m='964000'>differentiated. That is what it
  means to put</span> <span m='968000'>that prime there. To differentiate a matrix
  means</span> <span m='971000'>nothing fancy. It just means differentiate</span>
  <span m='974000'>every entry. It is just like to</span> <span m='976000'>differentiate
  a vector (x, y), to make a velocity vector</span> <span m='980000'>you differentiate
  the x and the y.</span> </p><p><span m='982000'>Well, a column vector is a special
  kind of matrix.</span> </p><p><span m='986000'>The definition applies to any matrix.</span>
  </p><p><span m='990000'>Well, why is that so? I state it as a property,</span> <span
  m='993000'>but I will continue it by giving you, so to speak,</span> <span m='997000'>the
  proof of it. In fact, there is nothing in</span> <span m='1000000'>this. It is nothing
  more than a</span> <span m='1002000'>little matrix calculation of the most primitive
  kind.</span> </p><p><span m='1006000'>Namely, what does this mean? Let's try to
  undo that.</span> </p><p><span m='1010000'>What does the left-hand side really mean?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1013000'>Well, if that is what x means, the left-hand side must
  mean</span> <span m='1018000'>the derivative of the first column.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1022000'>That is its first column. And the derivative of the</span> <span m='1025000'>second
  column. That is what it means to</span> <span m='1027000'>differentiate the matrix
  X. You differentiate each column</span> <span m='1031000'>separately. And to differentiate
  the column</span> <span m='1034000'>you need to differentiate every function in
  it.</span> </p><p><span m='1037000'>Well, what does the right-hand side mean?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1039000'>Well, I am supposed to take A and multiply that</span>
  <span m='1043000'>by [x1,x2]. Now, I don't know how to prove</span> <span m='1046000'>this,
  except ask you to think about it.</span> </p><p><span m='1050000'>Or, I could write
  it all out here.</span> </p><p><span m='1054000'>But think of this as a bing, bing,
  bing, bing.</span> </p><p><span m='1059000'>And this is a bing, bing.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1062000'>And this is a bong, bong.</span> </p><p><span m='1065000'>How do I do
  the multiplication? In other words,</span> <span m='1070000'>what is in the first
  column of the matrix?</span> </p><p><span m='1075000'>Well, it is dah, dah, and
  the lower thing is</span> <span m='1081000'>dah, dah. In other words,</span> <span
  m='1083000'>it is A times x1.</span> </p><p><span m='1095000'>Shut your eyes and
  visualize it.</span> </p><p><span m='1097000'>Got it? Dah, dah is the top entry,</span>
  <span m='1099000'>and dah, dah is the bottom entry.</span> </p><p><span m='1102000'>It
  is what you get by multiplying A by the column</span> <span m='1105000'>vector x1.
  And the same way the other guy</span> <span m='1108000'>is -- -- what you get by
  multiplying</span> <span m='1113000'>A by the column vector x2. This is just matrix</span>
  <span m='1117000'>multiplication. That is the law of matrix</span> <span m='1121000'>multiplication.
  That is how you multiply</span> <span m='1125000'>matrices. Well, good, but where
  does this</span> <span m='1129000'>get us? What does it mean for those two</span>
  <span m='1133000'>guys to be equal? That is going to happen,</span> <span m='1137000'>if
  and only if x1 prime is equal to A x1.</span> </p><p><span m='1142000'>This guy
  equals that guy. And similarly for the x2's.</span> </p><p><span m='1154000'>The
  end result is that this matrix, saying that the</span> <span m='1158000'>fundamental
  matrix satisfies this matrix differential</span> <span m='1162000'>equation is only
  a way of saying, in one breath,</span> <span m='1166000'>that its two columns are
  both solutions to the original</span> <span m='1170000'>system. It is, so to speak,</span>
  <span m='1173000'>an efficient way of turning these two equations into a</span>
  <span m='1178000'>single equation by making a matrix.</span> </p><p><span m='1181000'>I
  guess it is time, finally, to come to the topic</span> <span m='1186000'>of the
  lecture. I said the thing the matrices</span> <span m='1190000'>were going to be
  used for is solving inhomogeneous systems,</span> <span m='1195000'>so let's take
  a look at those. I thought I would give you an</span> <span m='1200000'>example.
  Inhomogeneous systems.</span> </p><p><span m='1210000'>Well, what is one going to
  look like?</span> </p><p><span m='1212000'>So far what we have done is, up until
  now has been solving,</span> <span m='1217000'>we spent essentially two weeks solving
  and plotting the</span> <span m='1221000'>solutions to homogeneous systems.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1223000'>There was nothing over there. And homogeneous systems,</span>
  <span m='1227000'>in fact, with constant coefficients.</span> </p><p><span m='1231000'>Stuff
  that looked like that that we abbreviated with</span> <span m='1234000'>matrices.
  Now, to make the system</span> <span m='1236000'>inhomogeneous what I do is add
  the extra term on the right-hand</span> <span m='1241000'>side, which is some function
  of t.</span> </p><p><span m='1243000'>Except, I will have to have two functions
  of t because I have</span> <span m='1247000'>two equations. Now it is inhomogeneous.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1250000'>And what makes it inhomogeneous is the fact that these
  are not</span> <span m='1254000'>zero anymore. There is something there.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1257000'>Functions of t are there. These are given functions of
  t</span> <span m='1262000'>like exponentials, polynomials,</span> <span m='1264000'>the
  usual stuff you have on the right-hand side of the</span> <span m='1268000'>differential
  equation. What is confusing here is that</span> <span m='1271000'>when we studied
  second order equations it was homogeneous if</span> <span m='1275000'>the right-hand
  side was zero, and if there was something else</span> <span m='1280000'>there it
  was inhomogeneous. Unfortunately,</span> <span m='1283000'>I have stuck this stuff
  on the right-hand side so it is not</span> <span m='1287000'>quite so clear anymore.
  It has got to look like that,</span> <span m='1292000'>in other words. How would
  the matrix</span> <span m='1294000'>abbreviation look? Well, the left-hand side
  is x</span> <span m='1297000'>prime. The homogenous part is ax,</span> <span m='1300000'>just
  as it has always been. The only extra part is those</span> <span m='1303000'>functions
  r. And this is a column vector,</span> <span m='1306000'>after the multiplication
  this is a column vector,</span> <span m='1310000'>what is left is column vector.
  Now, explicitly it is a</span> <span m='1313000'>function of t, given by explicit
  functions of</span> <span m='1316000'>t, again, like exponentials. Or, they could
  be fancy</span> <span m='1322000'>functions. That is the thing we are trying</span>
  <span m='1326000'>to solve. Why don't I put it up in green?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1330000'>Our new and better and improved system.</span> </p><p><span m='1333000'>Think
  back to what we did when we studied inhomogeneous</span> <span m='1338000'>equations.
  We are not talking about</span> <span m='1342000'>systems but just a single equation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1345000'>What we did was the main theorem --</span> <span m='1350000'>I
  guess there are going to be three theorems today,</span> <span m='1356000'>not just
  two. Theorem C.</span> </p><p><span m='1359000'>Is that right? Yes, A, B.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1362000'>We are up to C. Theorem C says that the general</span>
  <span m='1368000'>solution, that is, the general solution to the</span> <span m='1374000'>system,
  is equal to the complimentary function,</span> <span m='1380000'>which is the general
  solution to x prime equals Ax,</span> <span m='1386000'>-- -- the homogeneous equation,</span>
  <span m='1391000'>in other words, plus, what am I going to call</span> <span m='1395000'>it?
  (x)p, right you are,</span> <span m='1397000'>a particular solution. But the principle
  is the same</span> <span m='1402000'>and is proved exactly the same way.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1405000'>It is just linearity and superposition.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1415000'>The linearity of the original system and the superposition</span> <span
  m='1420000'>principle. The essence is that to solve</span> <span m='1423000'>this
  inhomogeneous system, what we have to do is find a</span> <span m='1428000'>particular
  solution. This part I already know how to</span> <span m='1432000'>do. We have been
  doing that for two</span> <span m='1435000'>weeks. The new thing is to find this.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1445000'>Now, if you remember back before spring break,</span> <span
  m='1448000'>most of the work in solving the second order equation was in</span>
  <span m='1452000'>finding that particular solution.</span> </p><p><span m='1455000'>You
  quickly enough learned how to solve the homogeneous</span> <span m='1459000'>equation,
  but there was no real general method for finding this.</span> </p><p><span m='1464000'>We
  had an exponential input theorem with some modifications</span> <span m='1468000'>to
  it. We took a week's detour in</span> <span m='1472000'>Fourier series to see how
  to do it for periodic functions or</span> <span m='1477000'>functions defined on
  finite intervals.</span> </p><p><span m='1480000'>There were other techniques which
  I did not get around to</span> <span m='1485000'>showing you, techniques involving
  the so-called method</span> <span m='1490000'>of undetermined coefficients. Although,
  some of you peaked in</span> <span m='1495000'>your book and learned it from there.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1500000'>But the work is in finding (x)p.</span> </p><p><span m='1503000'>The
  miracle that occurs here, by contrast,</span> <span m='1507000'>is that it turns
  out to be easy to find (x)p.</span> </p><p><span m='1511000'>And easy in this further
  sense that I do not have to restrict</span> <span m='1517000'>the kind of function
  I use. For example,</span> <span m='1521000'>the second homework problem I have
  given you,</span> <span m='1526000'>the second part two homework problem.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1536000'>You will see how to use systems.</span> </p><p><span m='1538000'>For
  example, to solve this simple equation,</span> <span m='1542000'>I will write it
  out for you, consider that equation,</span> <span m='1546000'>tangent t. What technique
  will you apply</span> <span m='1550000'>to solve that? In other words,</span> <span
  m='1552000'>suppose you wanted to find a particular solution to that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1557000'>The right-hand side is not an exponential.</span> </p><p><span m='1560000'>It
  is not a polynomial. It is not like sine or cosine</span> <span m='1566000'>of bt.
  I could use the Laplace</span> <span m='1570000'>transform. No, because you don't
  know how</span> <span m='1574000'>to take the Laplace transform of tangent t.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1579000'>Neither, for that matter, do I.</span> </p><p><span m='1581000'>Fourier
  series. Not a good choice for a</span> <span m='1585000'>function that goes to infinity
  at pi over two.</span> </p><p><span m='1595000'>So you cannot do this until you
  do your homework.</span> </p><p><span m='1599000'>Now you will be able to do it.
  In other words,</span> <span m='1604000'>one of the big things is not only will
  I give you a formula</span> <span m='1610000'>for the Xp but that formula will work
  even for tangent t,</span> <span m='1616000'>any function at all. Well, I thought
  I would try to</span> <span m='1620000'>put a little meat on the bones of the inhomogeneous
  systems by</span> <span m='1624000'>actually giving you a physical problem so we
  would actually be</span> <span m='1628000'>able to solve a physical problem instead
  of just demonstrate a</span> <span m='1632000'>solution method. Here is a mixing
  problem.</span> </p><p><span m='1643000'>Just to illustrate what makes a system
  of equations</span> <span m='1647000'>inhomogeneous, here at two ugly tanks.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1651000'>I am not going to draw these carefully, but they are both
  1</span> <span m='1657000'>liter. And they are connected by</span> <span m='1660000'>pipes.
  And I won't bother opening</span> <span m='1663000'>holes in them. There is a pipe
  with fluids</span> <span m='1667000'>flowing back there and this direction it is
  flowing this</span> <span m='1672000'>way, but that is not the end. The end is there
  is stuff</span> <span m='1680000'>coming in to both of them. And I think I will
  just make it</span> <span m='1688000'>coming out of this one. There is something
  realistic.</span> </p><p><span m='1695000'>The numbers 2, 3, 2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1698000'>Let's start there and see what the others have to be.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1705000'>So these are flow rates. One liter tanks.</span> </p><p><span m='1711000'>The
  flow rates are in, let's say, liters per hour.</span> </p><p><span m='1718000'>And
  I have some dissolved substance in,</span> <span m='1722000'>so here is going to
  be x salt in there and the same chemical</span> <span m='1730000'>in there, whatever
  it is. x is the amount of salt,</span> <span m='1736000'>let's say, in tank one.
  And y, the same thing in tank</span> <span m='1742000'>two. Now, if you have stuff
  flowing</span> <span m='1746000'>unequally this way, you must have balance.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1749000'>You have to make sure that neither tank is getting emptied</span>
  <span m='1755000'>or bursting and exploding. What is flowing in?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1759000'>What is x? Three is going out,</span> <span m='1762000'>two is coming
  in, so this has to be one in order</span> <span m='1767000'>that tank x stay full
  and not explode.</span> </p><p><span m='1772000'>And how about y? How much is going
  out?</span> </p><p><span m='1775000'>Two there and two here. Four is going out,</span>
  <span m='1779000'>three is coming in. This also has to be one.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1783000'>Those are just the flow rates of water or the liquid that is</span>
  <span m='1788000'>coming in. Now, the only thing I am going</span> <span m='1792000'>to
  specify is the concentration of what is coming in.</span> </p><p><span m='1798000'>Here
  the concentration is 5 e to the minus t.</span> </p><p><span m='1802000'>And that
  is what makes the problem inhomogeneous.</span> </p><p><span m='1807000'>Here the
  concentration is going to be zero.</span> </p><p><span m='1810000'>In other words,
  pure water is flowing in here</span> <span m='1814000'>to create the liquid balance.
  Here, on the other hand,</span> <span m='1818000'>salt solution is flowing in but
  with a steadily declining</span> <span m='1823000'>concentration. So, what is the
  system?</span> </p><p><span m='1828000'>Well, you have set it up exactly the way
  you did when you</span> <span m='1834000'>studied first order equations. It is inflow
  minus outflow.</span> </p><p><span m='1841000'>What is the outflow? The outflow
  is all in this</span> <span m='1846000'>pipe. The flow rates are liters per</span>
  <span m='1850000'>hour. Three liters per hour flowing</span> <span m='1854000'>out.
  How much salt does that</span> <span m='1857000'>represent? It is negative three
  times the</span> <span m='1862000'>concentration of salt. But the concentration,</span>
  <span m='1866000'>notice, equals x divided by one.</span> </p><p><span m='1870000'>In
  other words, x represents both the</span> <span m='1873000'>concentration and the
  amount. So I don't have to distinguish.</span> </p><p><span m='1878000'>If I had
  made it two liter tanks then I would have had to</span> <span m='1883000'>divide
  this by two. I am cheating,</span> <span m='1886000'>but it is enough already. x
  prime equals minus 3x.</span> </p><p><span m='1892000'>That is what is going out.
  What is coming in?</span> </p><p><span m='1896000'>Well, 2y is coming in. Concentration
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='1899000'>What is coming in? Is it y 2 liter?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1903000'>Plus what is coming in from the outside.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1906000'>We have to add that in, and that will be plus 5 e to</span> <span m='1911000'>the
  negative t. How about y?</span> </p><p><span m='1914000'>y prime is changing. What
  comes in from x?</span> </p><p><span m='1920000'>That is 3x. What goes out?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1921000'>Well, two is leaving here and two is leaving here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1925000'>It doesn't matter that they are going out through separate</span>
  <span m='1930000'>pipes. They are both going out.</span> </p><p><span m='1932000'>It
  is minus 4, 2 and 2.</span> </p><p><span m='1934000'>How about the inhomogeneous
  term?</span> </p><p><span m='1936000'>There is one coming in, but there is no salt
  in it.</span> </p><p><span m='1940000'>Therefore, that is not changing.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1943000'>What is coming through that pipe is necessary for the liquid</span>
  <span m='1947000'>balance. But it has no effect</span> <span m='1951000'>whatsoever.
  I will put a zero here but,</span> <span m='1955000'>of course, you don't have to
  put that in.</span> </p><p><span m='1958000'>This is now an inhomogeneous system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1962000'>In other words, the system is x prime equals</span> <span
  m='1966000'>this matrix, negative 3, the same sort of stuff we</span> <span m='1970000'>always
  had, plus the inhomogeneous term which is the</span> <span m='1975000'>column vector
  5 e to the minus t and zero.</span> </p><p><span m='1980000'>It is the presence
  of this term</span> <span m='1984000'>that makes this system inhomogeneous.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1986000'>And what that corresponds to is this little closed system
  being</span> <span m='1991000'>attacked from the outside by these external pipes
  which are</span> <span m='1995000'>bringing salt in. Without those,</span> <span
  m='1997000'>of course the balance would be all wrong.</span> </p><p><span m='2000000'>I
  would have to change this to three and cut that out,</span> <span m='2004000'>I
  guess. But then, it would be just a</span> <span m='2007000'>simple homogenous system.
  It is these pipes that make it</span> <span m='2012000'>inhomogeneous. Now, I should
  start to solve</span> <span m='2015000'>that. I did this just to illustrate</span>
  <span m='2018000'>where a system might come from. Before I solve that,</span> <span
  m='2022000'>what I want to do is, of course, is solve it in</span> <span m='2025000'>general.
  In other words,</span> <span m='2027000'>how do you solve this in general?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2029000'>Because I promised you that you would be able to do in
  general,</span> <span m='2034000'>regardless of what sort of functions were in the
  r of t,</span> <span m='2038000'>that column vector. So let's do it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2050000'>First of all, you have to learn the name of</span> <span m='2055000'>the
  method. This method is for solving x</span> <span m='2060000'>prime equals Ax. It
  is a method for finding a</span> <span m='2066000'>particular solution.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2076000'>Of course, to actually solve it then you have to add the</span> <span
  m='2079000'>complimentary function. We are looking for a particular</span> <span
  m='2083000'>solution for this system. Now, the whole cleverness of</span> <span
  m='2087000'>the method, which I think was discovered a couple hundred</span> <span
  m='2091000'>years ago by, I think, Lagrange,</span> <span m='2093000'>I am not sure.
  The method is called variation</span> <span m='2097000'>of parameters. I am giving
  you that so that</span> <span m='2100000'>when you forget you will be able to look
  it up and be indexes to</span> <span m='2105000'>some advanced engineering mathematics
  book or something,</span> <span m='2108000'>whatever is on your shelf. But, if course,</span>
  <span m='2111000'>you won't remember the name either so maybe this won't work.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2115000'>Variation of parameters, I will explain to you why it is</span>
  <span m='2119000'>called that. All the cleverness is in the</span> <span m='2122000'>very
  first line. If you could remember the very</span> <span m='2125000'>first line then
  I trust you to do the rest yourself.</span> </p><p><span m='2130000'>I don't know
  any motivation for this first step,</span> <span m='2134000'>but mathematics is
  supposed to be mysterious anyway.</span> </p><p><span m='2140000'>It keeps me eating.
  It says, look for a solution</span> <span m='2145000'>and there will be one of the
  following form.</span> </p><p><span m='2149000'>Now, it will look exactly like --</span>
  <span m='2160000'>Look carefully because it is going to be gone in a moment.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2164000'>It will look exactly like this. But, of course,</span>
  <span m='2168000'>it cannot be this because this solves the homogeneous system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2173000'>If I plug this in with these as constants it cannot possibly
  be</span> <span m='2178000'>a particular solution to this because it will stop there
  and</span> <span m='2183000'>satisfy that with r equals zero. The whole trick is
  you think of</span> <span m='2189000'>these are parameters which are now variable.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2192000'>Constants that are varying. That is why it is called</span>
  <span m='2195000'>variation of parameters. You think of these,</span> <span m='2198000'>in
  other words, as functions of t.</span> </p><p><span m='2201000'>We are going to
  look for a solution which has the form,</span> <span m='2205000'>since they are
  functions of t, I don't want to call them c1</span> <span m='2209000'>and c2 anymore.
  I will call them v because that</span> <span m='2212000'>is what most people call
  them, v or u, sometimes.</span> </p><p><span m='2222000'>The method says look for
  a solution of that form.</span> </p><p><span m='2226000'>The variation parameters,
  these are the parameters that</span> <span m='2230000'>are now varying instead of
  being constants.</span> </p><p><span m='2234000'>Now, if you take it in that form
  and start trying to</span> <span m='2238000'>substitute into the equation you are
  going to get a mess.</span> </p><p><span m='2243000'>I think I was wrong in saying
  I could trust you from this point</span> <span m='2248000'>on. I will take the first
  step from</span> <span m='2252000'>you, and then I could trust you to do the rest
  after that first</span> <span m='2258000'>step. The first step is to change the</span>
  <span m='2262000'>way this looks by using the fundamental matrix.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2266000'>Remember what the fundamental matrix was?</span> </p><p><span m='2270000'>Its
  entries were the two columns of solutions.</span> </p><p><span m='2274000'>These
  are solutions to the homogeneous system.</span> </p><p><span m='2280000'>And I am
  going to write it using the fundamental matrix as,</span> <span m='2285000'>now
  thinks about it. The fundamental matrix has</span> <span m='2289000'>columns x1
  and x2. Your instinct might be using</span> <span m='2293000'>matrix multiplication
  to put the v1 and the v2 here,</span> <span m='2298000'>but that won't work. You
  have to put them here.</span> </p><p><span m='2310000'>This says the same thing
  as that.</span> </p><p><span m='2313000'>Let's just take a second out to calculate.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2317000'>The x is going to look like (x1, y1).</span> </p><p><span
  m='2320000'>That is my first solution. My second solution,</span> <span m='2324000'>here
  is the fundamental matrix, is (x2, y2).</span> </p><p><span m='2329000'>And I am
  multiplying this on the right by (v1,</span> <span m='2333000'>v2). Does it come
  out right?</span> </p><p><span m='2336000'>Look. What is it?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2339000'>The top is x1 v1 plus x2 v2.</span> </p><p><span m='2342000'>The top,
  x1 v1 plus x2 v2.</span> </p><p><span m='2346000'>It is in the wrong order, but
  multiplication is</span> <span m='2350000'>commutative, fortunately. And the same
  way the bottom</span> <span m='2354000'>thing will be v1 y1 plus v2 y2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2358000'>If I had written it on the other side instead,</span> <span m='2362000'>which
  is tempting because the v's occur on the left here,</span> <span m='2367000'>that
  won't work. What will I get?</span> </p><p><span m='2371000'>I will get v1 x1 plus
  v2 y1,</span> <span m='2375000'>which is not at all what I want.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2377000'>You must put it on the right. But this is a very important</span> <span
  m='2382000'>thing. This is going to plague us on</span> <span m='2385000'>Monday,
  too. It must be written on the right</span> <span m='2389000'>and not on the left
  as a column vector.</span> </p><p><span m='2392000'>The rest of the program is very
  simple.</span> </p><p><span m='2395000'>I will write it out as a program.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2400000'>Substitute into the system, into that, in other words,</span>
  <span m='2404000'>and see what v has to be. That is what we are looking</span> <span
  m='2408000'>for. We know what the x1 and x2 are.</span> </p><p><span m='2411000'>It
  is a question of what those coefficients are.</span> </p><p><span m='2414000'>And
  see what v is. Let's do it.</span> </p><p><span m='2432000'>Let's substitute. Let's
  see.</span> </p><p><span m='2435000'>The system is x prime equals Ax plus r.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2441000'>I want to put in (x)p, this proposed particular</span>
  <span m='2446000'>solution. And it is a fundamental matrix,</span> <span m='2450000'>and
  the v is unknown. How do I differentiate the</span> <span m='2456000'>product of
  two matrices? You differentiate the product</span> <span m='2462000'>of two matrices
  using the product rule that you learned</span> <span m='2467000'>the first day of
  18.01. Trust me.</span> </p><p><span m='2470000'>Let's do it. I am going to substitute
  in.</span> </p><p><span m='2474000'>In other words, here is my (x)p,</span> <span
  m='2477000'>(x)p, and I am going to write in what that is.</span> </p><p><span m='2481000'>The
  left-hand side is the derivative of,</span> <span m='2485000'>X prime times v, plus
  X times the derivative of</span> <span m='2489000'>v. Notice that one of these is
  a</span> <span m='2494000'>column vector and the other is a square matrix.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2497000'>That is perfectly Okay. Any two matrices which are the</span>
  <span m='2499000'>rate shape so you can multiply them together,</span> <span m='2502000'>if
  you want to differentiate their product,</span> <span m='2504000'>in other words,
  if the entries are functions of</span> <span m='2506000'>t it is the product rule.
  The derivative of this times</span> <span m='2509000'>time plus that times the derivative
  of this.</span> </p><p><span m='2512000'>You have to keep them in the right order.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2514000'>You are not allowed to shuffle them around carelessly.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2517000'>So that is that. What is it equal to?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2520000'>Well, the right-hand side is A. And now I substitute just (x)p</span>
  <span m='2528000'>in, so that is X times v plus r. Is this progress?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2534000'>What is v? It looks like a mess but it is</span> <span m='2540000'>not.
  Why not?</span> </p><p><span m='2542000'>It is because this is not any old matrix
  X.</span> </p><p><span m='2549000'>This is a matrix whose columns are solutions
  to the system.</span> </p><p><span m='2554000'>And what does that do? That means
  X prime satisfies</span> <span m='2559000'>that matrix differential equation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2562000'>X prime is the same as Ax.</span> </p><p><span m='2565000'>And,
  by a little miracle, the v is tagging along in both</span> <span m='2570000'>cases.
  This cancels that and now there</span> <span m='2574000'>is very little left. The
  conclusion,</span> <span m='2578000'>therefore, is that Xv is equal to r.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2582000'>What is v? It is v that we are looking</span> <span m='2585000'>for,
  right? You have to solve a matrix</span> <span m='2589000'>equation, now. This is
  a square matrix so you</span> <span m='2593000'>have to do it by inverting the matrix.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2596000'>You don't just sloppily divide. You multiply on which side
  by</span> <span m='2601000'>what matrix? Choice of left or right.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2605000'>You multiply by the inverse matrix on the left or on the</span> <span
  m='2609000'>right? It has to be on the left.</span> </p><p><span m='2615000'>Multiply
  both sides of the equation by X inverse on the</span> <span m='2622000'>left, and
  then you will get v is equal to X inverse r.</span> </p><p><span m='2630000'>How
  do I know the X inverse</span> <span m='2635000'>exists? Does X inverse exist?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2640000'>For a matrix inverse to exist, the matrix's determinant
  must</span> <span m='2645000'>be not zero. Why is the determinant of this</span>
  <span m='2650000'>not zero? Because its columns are</span> <span m='2653000'>independent
  solutions.</span> </p><p><span m='2662000'>Of course this is not right. I forgot
  the prime here.</span> </p><p><span m='2671000'>I am not failing this course after
  all.</span> </p><p><span m='2674000'>v prime equals that.</span> </p><p><span m='2683000'>This
  is done by differentiating each entry in the column vector.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2687000'>And, therefore, we should integrate it.</span> </p><p><span m='2690000'>It
  will be the integral, just the ordinary</span> <span m='2693000'>anti-derivative
  of x inverse times r.</span> </p><p><span m='2697000'>This is a column vector. The
  entries are functions of t.</span> </p><p><span m='2702000'>You simply integrate
  each of those functions in turn.</span> </p><p><span m='2706000'>So integrate each
  entry.</span> </p><p><span m='2712000'>There is my v. Sorry, you cannot tell the
  v's</span> <span m='2719000'>from the r's here. And so, finally,</span> <span m='2725000'>the
  particular solution is (x)p is equal to --</span> <span m='2734000'>It is really
  not bad at all. It is equal to X times v.</span> </p><p><span m='2737000'>It's equal
  to X times the integral of X inverse r dt.</span> </p><p><span m='2740000'>Now,
  actually,</span> <span m='2743000'>there is not much work to doing that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2745000'>Once you have solved the homogeneous system and gotten</span>
  <span m='2749000'>the fundamental matrix, taking the inverse of a</span> <span m='2752000'>two-by-two
  matrix is almost trivial.</span> </p><p><span m='2754000'>You flip those two and
  you change the signs of these two</span> <span m='2757000'>and you divide by the
  determinant.</span> </p><p><span m='2761000'>You multiply it by r. And the hard
  part is if you can</span> <span m='2764000'>do the integration. If not, you just
  leave the</span> <span m='2767000'>integral sign the way you have learned to do
  in this silly</span> <span m='2771000'>course and you still have the answer.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2774000'>What about the arbitrary constant of integration?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2777000'>The answer is you don't need to put it in.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2780000'>Just find one particular solution.</span> </p><p><span m='2782000'>It
  is good enough. You don't have to put in the</span> <span m='2785000'>arbitrary
  constants of integration.</span> </p><p><span m='2789000'>Because they are already
  in the complimentary function here.</span> </p><p><span m='2793000'>Therefore, you
  don't have to add them.</span> </p><p><span m='2795000'>I am sorry I didn't get
  a chance to actually solve that.</span> </p><p><span m='2799000'>I will have to
  let it go. The recitations will do it on</span> <span m='2802000'>Tuesday, will
  solve that particular problem,</span> <span m='2805000'>which means you will, in
  effect.</span> </p>
