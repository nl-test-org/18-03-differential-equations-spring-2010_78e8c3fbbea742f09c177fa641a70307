transcript: '<p><span m=''7000''>We are going to start today in a serious way on the</span>
  <span m=''12000''>inhomogenous equation, second-order linear</span> <span m=''17000''>differential,
  I''ll simply write it out</span> <span m=''22000''>instead of writing out all the
  words which go with it.</span> </p><p><span m=''28000''>So, such an equation looks
  like, the second-order equation</span> <span m=''35000''>is going to look like y
  double prime plus p of x,</span> <span m=''40000''>t, x plus q of x times y. Now,
  up to now the right-hand</span> <span m=''47000''>side has been zero. So, now we
  are going to make it</span> <span m=''53000''>not be zero. So, this is going to
  be f of x.</span> </p><p><span m=''57000''>In the most frequent</span> <span m=''60000''>applications,
  x is time.</span> </p><p><span m=''62000''>x is usually time, often, but not always.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''68000''>So, maybe just for today, I will use X in talking about</span>
  <span m=''73000''>the general theory. And, from now on,</span> <span m=''76000''>I''ll
  probably make X equal time because that''s what is most of</span> <span m=''82000''>the
  time in the applications. So, this is the part we''ve been</span> <span m=''87000''>studying
  up until now. It has a lot of names.</span> </p><p><span m=''91000''>It''s input,
  signal, commas between those,</span> <span m=''95000''>a driving term, or sometimes
  it''s called the</span> <span m=''99000''>forcing term. You''ll see all of these
  in the</span> <span m=''104000''>literature, and it pretty much depends upon what
  course you''re</span> <span m=''108000''>sitting at, what the professor habitually
  calls it.</span> </p><p><span m=''112000''>I will try to use all these terms now
  and then,</span> <span m=''115000''>probably most often I will lapse into input
  as the most</span> <span m=''119000''>generic term, suggesting nothing in</span>
  <span m=''121000''>particular, and therefore, equally acceptable or</span> <span
  m=''125000''>unacceptable to everybody. The response,</span> <span m=''129000''>the
  solution, then, the solution as you know</span> <span m=''135000''>is then called
  the response. The response,</span> <span m=''140000''>sometimes it''s called the
  output.</span> </p><p><span m=''144000''>I think I''ll stick pretty much with response.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''151000''>So, I''m using pretty much the same terminology we use
  for</span> <span m=''155000''>studying first-order equations. Now, as you will see,</span>
  <span m=''160000''>the reason we had to study the homogeneous case first was</span>
  <span m=''165000''>because you cannot solve this without knowing the homogeneous</span>
  <span m=''170000''>solutions. So, that''s the inhomogeneous</span> <span m=''173000''>case.
  But the homogeneous one,</span> <span m=''176000''>the corresponding homogeneous
  thing, y double prime plus p of</span> <span m=''181000''>x y prime plus q of x
  times y equals zero</span> <span m=''186000''>is an essential part of the solution
  to this</span> <span m=''191000''>equation. That''s called,</span> <span m=''195000''>therefore,
  it has names. Now, unfortunately,</span> <span m=''199000''>it doesn''t have a single
  name. I don''t know what to call it,</span> <span m=''204000''>but I think I''ll
  probably call it the associated homogeneous</span> <span m=''210000''>equation,
  or ODE, the associated homogeneous</span> <span m=''214000''>equation, the one associated
  to the guy on the left.</span> </p><p><span m=''220000''>It''s also called the reduced
  equation by some people.</span> </p><p><span m=''224000''>There is some other term
  for it, which escapes me totally,</span> <span m=''228000''>but what the heck. Now,
  its solution has a name.</span> </p><p><span m=''232000''>So, its solution, of course,
  doesn''t depend on</span> <span m=''235000''>anything in particular, the general
  solution,</span> <span m=''238000''>because the right-hand side is always zero.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''243000''>So, its solution, we know can be written as y</span> <span
  m=''246000''>equals in the form c1 y1 plus c2 y2,</span> <span m=''250000''>where
  y1 and y2 are any two independent solutions of that,</span> <span m=''254000''>and
  then c1''s and c2''s are arbitrary constants.</span> </p><p><span m=''257000''>Now,
  what you are looking at this equation,</span> <span m=''260000''>you''re going to
  need this also. And therefore,</span> <span m=''264000''>it has a name. It has various
  names.</span> </p><p><span m=''266000''>Sometimes there is a subscript, c, there.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''271000''>Sometimes there''s a subscript, h.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''274000''>Sometimes there''s no subscript at all, which is the most</span> <span
  m=''279000''>confusing of all. But, anyway,</span> <span m=''282000''>what''s the
  name given to it? Well, there is no name.</span> </p><p><span m=''287000''>Many
  books call it the solution to the associated homogeneous</span> <span m=''293000''>equation.
  That''s maximally long.</span> </p><p><span m=''296000''>Your book calls it the
  complementary solution.</span> </p><p><span m=''302000''>Many people call it that,
  and many will look at you with</span> <span m=''306000''>a blank, who know differential
  equations very well,</span> <span m=''310000''>and will not have the faintest idea
  what you''re talking about.</span> </p><p><span m=''314000''>If you call it (y)h,
  then you are thinking of it as</span> <span m=''318000''>the solution; the h is
  for homogeneous to</span> <span m=''321000''>indicate it''s the solution. So, it''s
  the solution to the,</span> <span m=''326000''>I''m not going to write that. You
  put it in her books if you</span> <span m=''330000''>like writing. Write solution
  to the</span> <span m=''333000''>associated homogeneous equation, y(h).</span> </p><p><span
  m=''336000''>But, it''s all the same thing. Now, or the solution to the</span> <span
  m=''341000''>reduced equation, I see I have in my notes.</span> </p><p><span m=''345000''>Okay,
  good, the solution to the reduced equation,</span> <span m=''348000''>too. Okay,
  now, the examples,</span> <span m=''350000''>there are, of course, two classical
  examples,</span> <span m=''353000''>of which you know one. But, use them as the
  model for</span> <span m=''357000''>what solutions of these things should look like
  and how they</span> <span m=''362000''>should behave. So, the model you know already</span>
  <span m=''366000''>is the one, I won''t make the leading coefficient one because</span>
  <span m=''371000''>it usually isn''t, is the one, m x double prime,</span> <span
  m=''375000''>so t is the independent variable,</span> <span m=''378000''>plus b
  x prime plus k x equals f of t.</span> </p><p><span m=''383000''>That''s the spring-mass
  system,</span> <span m=''386000''>the spring-mass-dashpot system. Mass, the damping
  constant and</span> <span m=''392000''>the spring constant, except up to now,</span>
  <span m=''395000''>it''s always been zero here. What does this f of t</span> <span
  m=''400000''>represent? Well, if you think of the way</span> <span m=''403000''>in
  which I derived the equation, the mx, that was the Newton''s</span> <span m=''409000''>law.
  That''s the acceleration.</span> </p><p><span m=''411000''>So, it''s the acceleration,
  the mass times the</span> <span m=''415000''>acceleration. By Newton''s law,</span>
  <span m=''417000''>this is equal to the imposed force on the little mass truck.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''424000''>Okay, you got that truck, there.</span> </p><p><span m=''426000''>I''m
  not going to draw the truck for the nth time.</span> </p><p><span m=''429000''>You''ll
  have to imagine it. So, here''s our truck.</span> </p><p><span m=''433000''>Okay,
  forces are acting on it. Remember, the forces were</span> <span m=''437000''>minus
  kx. That came from the spring.</span> </p><p><span m=''440000''>There was a force,
  minus b x prime.</span> </p><p><span m=''443000''>That came from the dashpot, the
  damping force.</span> </p><p><span m=''446000''>So, this other guy is f of t.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''450000''>What''s this? This is the external force,</span> <span
  m=''452000''>which is acting out. In other words,</span> <span m=''454000''>instead
  of the little truck going back and forth and doing</span> <span m=''458000''>its
  own thing all by itself, here''s someone with an</span> <span m=''461000''>electromagnet,
  and the mass it''s carrying is a</span> <span m=''464000''>big pile of iron ore.
  You''re turning it on and off,</span> <span m=''467000''>and pulling that thing
  from afar where nobody can see it.</span> </p><p><span m=''471000''>So, this is
  the external force. Now, think, that is the model</span> <span m=''475000''>you
  must have in your mind of how these equations are treated.</span> </p><p><span m=''480000''>In
  other words, when f of t is zero,</span> <span m=''483000''>the system is passive.
  There is no external force on</span> <span m=''487000''>it when this is zero. The
  system is sitting,</span> <span m=''490000''>and just doing what it wants to do,
  all by itself.</span> </p><p><span m=''494000''>You wanted up by giving it an initial
  push,</span> <span m=''497000''>and putting its initial position somewhere.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''500000''>But after that, you lay your hands off.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''503000''>The system then just passively responds to its initial</span> <span
  m=''507000''>conditions and does what it wants.</span> </p><p><span m=''511000''>The
  other model is that you don''t let it respond the way it</span> <span m=''515000''>wants
  to. You force it from the outside</span> <span m=''517000''>by pushing it with an
  external force.</span> </p><p><span m=''520000''>Now, those are clearly two entirely
  different problems:</span> <span m=''524000''>what it does by itself, or what it
  does when it''s acted</span> <span m=''528000''>on from outside. And, when I explained
  to you</span> <span m=''531000''>how the thing is to be solved, you have to keep
  in mind those</span> <span m=''535000''>two models. So, this is the forced system.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''540000''>I''ll just use the word, forced system,</span> <span m=''542000''>that''s
  where f of t is not zero, versus the passive</span> <span m=''547000''>system where
  there is no external applied force.</span> </p><p><span m=''551000''>The passive
  system, the forced system,</span> <span m=''554000''>now, you have to both, even
  if you wanted to solve the</span> <span m=''558000''>forced system, the way the
  system would behave</span> <span m=''562000''>if nothing would be done to it from
  the outside is nonetheless</span> <span m=''567000''>going to be an important part
  of the solution.</span> </p><p><span m=''572000''>And, I won''t be able to give
  you that solution without</span> <span m=''575000''>knowing this also. Now, I''d
  like to give you the</span> <span m=''578000''>other model very rapidly because
  it''s in your book.</span> </p><p><span m=''582000''>It''s in the problems I have
  to give you.</span> </p><p><span m=''585000''>You know, it''s part of everybody''s
  culture,</span> <span m=''588000''>whether they like it or not. So, that''s example
  number one.</span> </p><p><span m=''592000''>Example number two, which follows the
  differential</span> <span m=''595000''>equation just as perfectly as the spring-mass-dashpot
  system</span> <span m=''599000''>is the simple electric circuit. The inductance,</span>
  <span m=''604000''>you don''t know yet what an inductance is,</span> <span m=''608000''>officially,
  but you will, a resistance,</span> <span m=''611000''>sorry, that''s okay, put the
  capacitance up there,</span> <span m=''615000''>resistance, and then maybe a thing.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''618000''>So, this is a resistance. I think you know these symbols.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''624000''>By now, you certainly know the system for capacitance.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''628000''>What I mean when I say C is the capacitance, you may not
  know</span> <span m=''634000''>yet what L is. That''s called the inductance.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''639000''>So, this is something called a coil because it looks like
  one.</span> </p><p><span m=''643000''>L is what''s called its inductance.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''645000''>And, the differential equation, there are two differential</span>
  <span m=''650000''>equations which can be used in this.</span> </p><p><span m=''652000''>They
  are essentially the same. One is simply the derivative of</span> <span m=''656000''>the
  other. Both differential equations</span> <span m=''659000''>come from Kirchhoff''s
  voltage law, that the sum of the voltage</span> <span m=''664000''>drops as you
  move around the circuit --</span> <span m=''668000''>-- has to be zero because otherwise,
  I don''t have to,</span> <span m=''671000''>that''s because of somebody''s law,
  Kirchhoff,</span> <span m=''674000''>with two h''s. The sum of the voltage drops
  to</span> <span m=''677000''>zero, and now you know the voltage drop across this,</span>
  <span m=''681000''>and you know the voltage drop across that because you learned</span>
  <span m=''685000''>in 8.02. You will, one day,</span> <span m=''687000''>learn the
  voltage drop across this.</span> </p><p><span m=''689000''>But, I already know it.
  It''s Li.</span> </p><p><span m=''692000''>So, i is the current. I''ll write this
  thing in its</span> <span m=''697000''>primitive form first. So, i is the current
  that''s</span> <span m=''702000''>flowing in the circuit. q is the charge on the</span>
  <span m=''707000''>capacitance. So, the voltage drop across the</span> <span m=''711000''>coil
  is L times i. The voltage shop across the,</span> <span m=''717000''>Li prime, the
  voltage drop across the</span> <span m=''722000''>resistance is, well, you know
  that.</span> </p><p><span m=''727000''>And, the voltage shop across the capacitance
  is q</span> <span m=''730000''>divided by C. And so, that''s equal to,</span> <span
  m=''733000''>well, it''s equal to zero, except if there''s a battery</span> <span
  m=''736000''>here or something generating a voltage drop,</span> <span m=''739000''>so,
  let''s call that E is a generic word.</span> </p><p><span m=''741000''>E could be
  a battery. It could be a source of</span> <span m=''744000''>alternating current,
  something like that.</span> </p><p><span m=''747000''>But, there''s a voltage drop
  across it, and I''m giving E the</span> <span m=''751000''>name of the voltage drop.
  So, and then there''s the</span> <span m=''755000''>question of the signs, which
  I know I''ll never</span> <span m=''758000''>understand. But, let''s assume you''ve
  chosen</span> <span m=''761000''>the sign convention so that this comes out nicely
  on the</span> <span m=''764000''>right-hand side. So, this might be varying</span>
  <span m=''767000''>sinusoidally, in which case you''d have source</span> <span m=''770000''>of
  alternating current. Or, it might be constant,</span> <span m=''773000''>in which
  that would be a battery, a little dry cell</span> <span m=''776000''>giving you
  direct current of a constant voltage,</span> <span m=''779000''>stuff like that.
  So, you could make this minus</span> <span m=''783000''>if you want, but everything
  will have the wrong signs,</span> <span m=''787000''>so don''t do it. Now, this
  doesn''t look like</span> <span m=''789000''>what it''s supposed to look like because
  it''s got q and i.</span> </p><p><span m=''793000''>So, the final thing you have
  to know is that q prime is</span> <span m=''797000''>equal to i. The rate at which
  that charge</span> <span m=''799000''>leaves the condenser and hurries around the
  circuit to find its</span> <span m=''803000''>little soul mate on the other side
  is the current that''s</span> <span m=''807000''>flowing in the circuit. That''s
  why current flows,</span> <span m=''810000''>except nothing really happens. Electrons
  just push on each</span> <span m=''815000''>other, and they stay where they are.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''817000''>I don''t understand this at all. So, if I differentiate
  this,</span> <span m=''822000''>you can do two things. Either you could integrate
  i,</span> <span m=''826000''>and expressed the thing entirely in terms of q,</span>
  <span m=''830000''>or you can differentiate it, and express everything in terms</span>
  <span m=''834000''>of i. Your book does nicely both,</span> <span m=''837000''>does
  not take sides. So, let''s differentiate it,</span> <span m=''842000''>and then
  it will look like L i double prime plus R i prime plus</span> <span m=''846000''>i
  divided by C equals,</span> <span m=''849000''>and now, watch out, you have now
  not the</span> <span m=''852000''>electromotive force, but its derivative.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''855000''>So, if you were so unfortunate as to put a little dry
  cell</span> <span m=''859000''>there, now you''ve got nothing, and you''ve got the
  homogeneous</span> <span m=''864000''>case. That''s okay.</span> </p><p><span m=''865000''>Where
  are the erasers? One eraser?</span> </p><p><span m=''868000''>I don''t believe this.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''883000''>So, there''s the equation. There are our two equations.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''887000''>Why don''t we put them up in colored chalk.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''890000''>There''s the spring equation. And, here''s the equation that</span>
  <span m=''894000''>governs the current, for how the current flows in</span> <span
  m=''898000''>that circuit. And now, you can see,</span> <span m=''901000''>again,
  what does it mean? If this is zero,</span> <span m=''904000''>for example, if I
  have a dry cell there,</span> <span m=''907000''>or if I have nothing at all in
  the circuit, then this</span> <span m=''911000''>represents the passive circuit.
  It''s just sitting there.</span> </p><p><span m=''916000''>It wouldn''t do anything
  at all, except that you''ve put a charge</span> <span m=''920000''>on the capacitor,
  and waited, and of course,</span> <span m=''922000''>when you put a charge on there,
  it''s got a discharge,</span> <span m=''926000''>and discharges through the circuit,
  and swings back and</span> <span m=''929000''>forth a little bit if it''s under-damped
  until finally</span> <span m=''932000''>towards the end the current dies away to
  zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''936000''>But, what usually happens is that you drive
  this passive</span> <span m=''939000''>circuit by putting an effective E in it,
  and then you want to</span> <span m=''944000''>know how the current behaves. So,
  those are the two problems,</span> <span m=''948000''>the passive circuit without
  an applied electromotive force,</span> <span m=''952000''>or plugging it into the
  wall, and wanting it to do things.</span> </p><p><span m=''956000''>That''s the
  normal state of affairs.</span> </p><p><span m=''960000''>People don''t want passive
  circuits, they want circuits</span> <span m=''963000''>which do things because,
  okay, that''s why they want to</span> <span m=''967000''>solve inhomogeneous equations
  instead of homogeneous</span> <span m=''971000''>equations. But as I said,</span>
  <span m=''973000''>you have to do the homogeneous case first.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''976000''>Okay, you are now officially responsible for this,</span> <span m=''980000''>and
  I don''t care that you haven''t had it in physics yet.</span> </p><p><span m=''984000''>You
  will before the next exam. So, I don''t even feel guilty.</span> </p><p><span m=''990000''>But,
  you''re going to start using it on the problem set</span> <span m=''994000''>right
  away. So, it''s never too soon to</span> <span m=''997000''>start learning it. Okay,
  now, the main theorem,</span> <span m=''1001000''>I now want to go, so that was
  just examples to</span> <span m=''1004000''>give you some physical feeling for the
  sorts of differential</span> <span m=''1009000''>equations we''ll be talking about.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1012000''>I now want to tell you briefly about the key theorem
  about</span> <span m=''1016000''>solving the homogeneous equation.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1019000''>So, the main theorem about solving the homogeneous equation</span>
  <span m=''1024000''>is, the inhomogeneous equation. So, I''m going to write the</span>
  <span m=''1029000''>inhomogeneous equation out. I''m going to make the left-hand</span>
  <span m=''1034000''>side a linear operator, and am going to write the</span> <span
  m=''1038000''>equation as Ly equals f of x.</span> </p><p><span m=''1041000''>That''s
  the inhomogeneous equation.</span> </p><p><span m=''1043000''>So, L is the linear
  operator, second order because I''m only</span> <span m=''1048000''>talking about
  second-order equations.</span> </p><p><span m=''1052000''>L is a linear operator,
  and then this is the</span> <span m=''1057000''>differential equation. So, here''s
  our differential</span> <span m=''1063000''>equation. It''s inhomogeneous because
  it''s</span> <span m=''1068000''>go the f of x on the right hand side.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1073000''>And, what the theorem says is that the solution has the</span> <span
  m=''1080000''>following form, y sub p, I''ll explain what that</span> <span m=''1085000''>is
  in just a moment, plus y sub c.</span> </p><p><span m=''1093000''>So, the hypothesis
  is we''ve got the linear equation,</span> <span m=''1097000''>and the conclusion
  is that that''s what its solution looks</span> <span m=''1101000''>like. Now, you
  already know what y</span> <span m=''1104000''>sub c looks like. In other words,</span>
  <span m=''1107000''>if I write this out in more detail, it would be i.e.,</span>
  <span m=''1111000''>department of fuller explanation, --</span> <span m=''1115000''>--
  the general solution looks like y equals yp,</span> <span m=''1118000''>and then
  this thing is going to look like an arbitrary constant</span> <span m=''1123000''>times
  y1 plus an arbitrary constant times y2,</span> <span m=''1127000''>where these are
  solutions of the homogeneous equation.</span> </p><p><span m=''1131000''>So, Yc
  looks like this part, and the yp, what''s yp?</span> </p><p><span m=''1135000''>p
  stands for particular, the most confusing word in this</span> <span m=''1140000''>subject.
  But, you''ve got at least four</span> <span m=''1144000''>weeks to learn what it
  means. Okay, yp is a particular</span> <span m=''1150000''>solution to Ly equals
  f of x.</span> </p><p><span m=''1154000''>Now, I''m not going to explain what particular
  means.</span> </p><p><span m=''1159000''>First, I''ll chat as if you knew what it
  meant,</span> <span m=''1164000''>and then we''ll see if you have picked it up.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1170000''>In other words, the procedure for solving this</span>
  <span m=''1173000''>equation is composed of two steps.</span> </p><p><span m=''1176000''>First,
  to find this part. In other words,</span> <span m=''1180000''>to find the complementary
  solution, in other words,</span> <span m=''1184000''>to do what we''ve been doing
  for the last week,</span> <span m=''1188000''>solve not the equation you are given,
  but the reduced equation.</span> </p><p><span m=''1193000''>So, the first step is
  to find this.</span> </p><p><span m=''1196000''>The second step is to find yp. Now,
  what''s yp?</span> </p><p><span m=''1201000''>yp is a particular solution to the
  whole equation.</span> </p><p><span m=''1205000''>Yeah, but which one? Well, if
  it''s any one,</span> <span m=''1209000''>then it''s not a particular solution,
  yeah.</span> </p><p><span m=''1212000''>I say, unfortunately the word particular
  here is not being</span> <span m=''1217000''>used in exactly the same sense in which
  most people use it in</span> <span m=''1222000''>ordinary English. It''s a perfectly
  valid way to</span> <span m=''1226000''>use it. It''s just confusing,</span> <span
  m=''1229000''>and no one has ever come up with a better word.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1233000''>So, particular means any one solution.</span> </p><p><span m=''1238000''>Any
  one will do. Okay, even these have slightly</span> <span m=''1245000''>different
  meanings. Any questions about this?</span> </p><p><span m=''1251000''>I refuse to
  answer them. [LAUGHTER]</span> <span m=''1258000''>Now, well, examples of course
  will make it all clear.</span> </p><p><span m=''1263000''>But I''d like, first,
  to prove the theorem,</span> <span m=''1268000''>to show you how simple it is. It''s
  extremely simple if you</span> <span m=''1275000''>just use the fact that L is a
  linear operator.</span> </p><p><span m=''1280000''>We''ve got two things to prove.
  What have we got to prove?</span> </p><p><span m=''1286000''>Well, I have to prove
  two statements, first of all,</span> <span m=''1292000''>that all the yp plus c1
  y1 plus c2 y2 are</span> <span m=''1299000''>solutions. How are we going to prove
  that?</span> </p><p><span m=''1303000''>Well, how do you know if something is a
  solution?</span> </p><p><span m=''1306000''>Well, you plug it into the equation,
  and you see if it</span> <span m=''1309000''>satisfies the equation. Good, let''s
  do it,</span> <span m=''1312000''>proof. L, I''m going to plug it into</span> <span
  m=''1314000''>the equation. That means I calculate L of yp</span> <span m=''1316000''>plus
  c1 y1 plus c2 y2.</span> </p><p><span m=''1320000''>Now, what''s the answer? Because
  this is a linear</span> <span m=''1324000''>operator, and notice, the argument doesn''t
  use the</span> <span m=''1328000''>fact that the equation is second order.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1332000''>It immediately generalizes to a linear equation of any
  order,</span> <span m=''1337000''>whatever-- 47. Okay, this is L of yp plus L of</span>
  <span m=''1341000''>c1 y1 plus c2 y2.</span> </p><p><span m=''1345000''>Well, what''s
  that? What''s L of the complementary</span> <span m=''1349000''>solution? What does
  it mean to be the</span> <span m=''1354000''>complementary solution? It means when
  you apply the</span> <span m=''1357000''>operator L to it, you get zero because
  this</span> <span m=''1360000''>satisfies the homogeneous equation.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1363000''>So, this is zero. What''s L of yp?</span> </p><p><span m=''1366000''>Well,
  it was a particular solution to the equation.</span> </p><p><span m=''1370000''>Therefore,
  when I plugged it into the equation,</span> <span m=''1373000''>I must have gotten
  out on the right-hand side,</span> <span m=''1377000''>f of x. So, this is since
  yp is a</span> <span m=''1380000''>solution to the whole equation. So, what''s the
  conclusion?</span> </p><p><span m=''1386000''>That, if I take any one of these guys,
  no matter what c1</span> <span m=''1390000''>and c2 are, apply the linear operator,
  L to it,</span> <span m=''1393000''>the answer comes out to be f of.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1397000''>Therefore, this proves that this shows that these are all</span> <span
  m=''1401000''>solutions because that''s what it means.</span> </p><p><span m=''1404000''>Therefore,
  they satisfy L of y equals f of x.</span> </p><p><span m=''1410000''>They satisfy
  the whole inhomogeneous differential</span> <span m=''1414000''>equation, and that''s
  it. Well, that''s only half the</span> <span m=''1418000''>story. The other half
  of the story is</span> <span m=''1421000''>to show that there are no other solutions.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1425000''>Okay, so we got our little u of x coming up again,</span>
  <span m=''1430000''>and he thinks he''s a solution. Okay, so, to prove there are
  no</span> <span m=''1435000''>other solutions, it almost sounds biblical,</span>
  <span m=''1439000''>thou shalt have no other solutions before me,</span> <span m=''1443000''>okay.
  There are no other solutions</span> <span m=''1447000''>accept these guys for different
  values of c1 and c2.</span> </p><p><span m=''1450000''>Okay, so, u of x is a solution.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1453000''>I have to show that u of x is one of these guys.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1456000''>How am I going to do that? Easy.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1459000''>If it''s a solution that, L of u,</span> <span m=''1461000''>okay,
  I''m going to drop the x, okay, just to make the,</span> <span m=''1465000''>like
  I dropped the x over there.</span> </p><p><span m=''1469000''>If it''s a solution
  to the whole inhomogeneous equation,</span> <span m=''1473000''>then this must come
  out to be f of x.</span> </p><p><span m=''1477000''>Now, what''s L of yp? That''s
  f of x too,</span> <span m=''1481000''>by secret little particular solution I''ve
  got in my pocket.</span> </p><p><span m=''1487000''>Okay, I pull it out, ah-ha,
  L of yp,</span> <span m=''1490000''>that''s f of x, too.</span> </p><p><span m=''1491000''>Now,
  I''m going to not add them. I''m going to subtract them.</span> </p><p><span m=''1496000''>What
  is L of u minus yp?</span> </p><p><span m=''1500000''>Well, it''s zero. It''s zero
  because this is a</span> <span m=''1505000''>linear operator. This would be L of
  u minus L of</span> <span m=''1508000''>yp. I guess the answer is zero on</span>
  <span m=''1512000''>the right-hand side. And therefore,</span> <span m=''1514000''>what
  is the conclusion? If that''s zero,</span> <span m=''1517000''>it must be a solution
  to the homogeneous equation.</span> </p><p><span m=''1521000''>Therefore, u minus
  yp is equal to,</span> <span m=''1524000''>there must be c1 and c2. I won''t give
  them the generic</span> <span m=''1528000''>names. I''ll give them a name,</span>
  <span m=''1530000''>a particular one. I''ll put a tilde to indicate</span> <span
  m=''1534000''>it''s a particular one. c1 plus c2 y2 tilde,</span> <span m=''1537000''>so,
  in other words, for some choice of these</span> <span m=''1541000''>constants, and
  I''ll call those particular choices c1 tilde and</span> <span m=''1545000''>c2 tilde,
  it must be that these are equal.</span> </p><p><span m=''1548000''>Well, what does
  that say? It says that u is equal to yp</span> <span m=''1552000''>plus c1 tilde,
  blah, blah, blah,</span> <span m=''1554000''>blah, plus c2 tilde, blah, blah, blah,</span>
  <span m=''1557000''>blah, and therefore chose that u wasn''t a new solution.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1562000''>It was one of these. So, u isn''t new.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1568000''>So, I should write it down. Otherwise some of you will have</span>
  <span m=''1578000''>missed the punch line. Okay, therefore,</span> <span m=''1585000''>u
  is equal to yp plus c1 tilde y1 plus c2 tilde y2.</span> </p><p><span m=''1596000''>And,
  it shows. This guy who thought he was new</span> <span m=''1599000''>was not new
  at all. It was just one of the other</span> <span m=''1603000''>solutions. Okay,
  well, now,</span> <span m=''1605000''>since the coefficient''s a constant, apparently
  we''ve done</span> <span m=''1609000''>half the work. We know what the complementary</span>
  <span m=''1612000''>solution is because you know how to do those in terms of</span>
  <span m=''1616000''>exponentials and complex exponentials,</span> <span m=''1619000''>signs
  and cosines, and so on.</span> </p><p><span m=''1623000''>So, what''s left to do?
  All we have to do is find to</span> <span m=''1627000''>solve equations, which are
  inhomogeneous.</span> </p><p><span m=''1630000''>All we have to do is find a particular
  solution,</span> <span m=''1634000''>find one solution. It doesn''t matter which
  one,</span> <span m=''1638000''>any one. Just find one,</span> <span m=''1640000''>okay?
  Now, we''re going to spend the</span> <span m=''1643000''>next two weeks trying
  to do this.</span> </p><p><span m=''1646000''>I''ll give you various methods. I''ll
  give you a general method</span> <span m=''1652000''>involving Fourier series because
  it''s a good excuse for learning</span> <span m=''1657000''>what Fourier series
  are. But, the answer is that in</span> <span m=''1661000''>general, for a few standard
  functions, it''s known how to do</span> <span m=''1665000''>this. You will learn
  those methods</span> <span m=''1668000''>for finding those using operators.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1670000''>For all the others, it''s done by a series,</span> <span
  m=''1674000''>or a method involving approximation.</span> </p><p><span m=''1678000''>Or,
  the worse comes to worst, you throw it on a computer and</span> <span m=''1682000''>just
  take a graph and the numerical output of answers as</span> <span m=''1687000''>the
  particular solution. Okay, now before,</span> <span m=''1690000''>we are going to
  start that work, not today.</span> </p><p><span m=''1694000''>We''ll start it next
  Monday, and it will last,</span> <span m=''1698000''>as I say the next two weeks.
  And, we will be up to spring</span> <span m=''1702000''>break. But, before we do
  that,</span> <span m=''1705000''>I''d like to relate this to what we did for first
  order equations</span> <span m=''1710000''>because there is something to be learned
  from that.</span> </p><p><span m=''1716000''>Think back to the linear first-order
  equation,</span> <span m=''1718000''>and I''m going to, since from now on for the
  rest</span> <span m=''1721000''>of the period, I''m going to be considering the</span>
  <span m=''1724000''>case for constant coefficients. In other words,</span> <span
  m=''1727000''>this case of springs or circuits or simple systems which</span> <span
  m=''1731000''>behave like those and have constant coefficients.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1734000''>So, for the linear, first-order equation,</span> <span m=''1736000''>there,
  too, I''m going to think of constant coefficients.</span> </p><p><span m=''1741000''>We
  talked quite a bit about this equation.</span> </p><p><span m=''1744000''>What did
  I call the right-hand side?</span> </p><p><span m=''1746000''>I think we usually
  called it q of t,</span> <span m=''1749000''>right? This is in ancient history.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1752000''>The definition of ancient history was before the first</span>
  <span m=''1756000''>exam. Okay, now how does that fit</span> <span m=''1758000''>into
  this theorem that I''ve given you?</span> </p><p><span m=''1761000''>Remember what
  the solution looked like.</span> </p><p><span m=''1765000''>The solution looked
  like, remember, you took the</span> <span m=''1768000''>integrating factor was e
  to the kt,</span> <span m=''1772000''>and then after you integrated both sides,
  multiplied through,</span> <span m=''1777000''>and then the final answer looked
  like this,</span> <span m=''1781000''>y equaled, it was e to the negative kt times</span>
  <span m=''1785000''>either an indefinite integral, or a definite integral</span>
  <span m=''1790000''>depending on your preference, q of t,</span> <span m=''1794000''>so,
  x is metamorphosed into t. I gather you''ve got that,</span> <span m=''1798000''>e
  to the kt plus, what was the other term?</span> </p><p><span m=''1802000''>A constant
  times e to the negative kt</span> <span m=''1808000''>How does this fit into the
  paradigm I''ve given you over</span> <span m=''1812000''>there for solving the second
  order equation?</span> </p><p><span m=''1815000''>Which term is which? Well, this
  has the arbitrary</span> <span m=''1819000''>constant in it. So, this must be the</span>
  <span m=''1822000''>complementary solution. Is it?</span> </p><p><span m=''1824000''>Is
  this the solution to the associated homogeneous equation?</span> </p><p><span m=''1830000''>What''s
  the associated homogeneous equation?</span> </p><p><span m=''1832000''>Put zero
  here. Okay, if you put zero there,</span> <span m=''1835000''>what''s the solution?
  Now, this you ought to know.</span> </p><p><span m=''1838000''>y prime equals negative
  ky.</span> </p><p><span m=''1840000''>What''s the solution? e to the negative kt.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1843000''>You are supposed to come into</span> <span m=''1846000''>this
  course knowing that, except there''s an arbitrary</span> <span m=''1849000''>constant
  in front. So, right, this is exactly the</span> <span m=''1852000''>solution to
  the associated homogeneous equation,</span> <span m=''1855000''>where there is zero
  here. Then, what''s this thing?</span> </p><p><span m=''1860000''>This is a particular
  solution. This is my yp.</span> </p><p><span m=''1862000''>But that''s not a particular
  solution because this indefinite</span> <span m=''1866000''>integral, you know,
  has an arbitrary constant in</span> <span m=''1869000''>it. In fact, it''s just
  that</span> <span m=''1870000''>arbitrary constant. So, it''s totally confusing.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1873000''>But, this symbol, you know when you actually</span> <span
  m=''1876000''>solve the equation this way, all you did was you found one</span>
  <span m=''1880000''>function here. You didn''t throw in the</span> <span m=''1882000''>arbitrary
  constant right away. All you needed to do was find</span> <span m=''1886000''>one
  function. And, even if you really are</span> <span m=''1889000''>bothered by the
  fact that this is so indefinite,</span> <span m=''1892000''>and therefore, make
  it a particular solution</span> <span m=''1895000''>by making this zero, make it
  a definite integral,</span> <span m=''1898000''>zero, here, t there, and then change
  those t''s to</span> <span m=''1902000''>dummy t''s, t1''s or t tildes, or something
  like that.</span> </p><p><span m=''1905000''>So, this fits into that thing. In other
  words,</span> <span m=''1908000''>I could have done it at that time, but I didn''t
  the point</span> <span m=''1912000''>because this can be solved directly, whereas,</span>
  <span m=''1915000''>of course, the general second order equation in homogeneous</span>
  <span m=''1918000''>cannot be solved directly, and therefore you have to be</span>
  <span m=''1922000''>willing to talk about what its solutions look like in advance.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1928000''>Now, remember I said, we talked, I said there was two</span>
  <span m=''1932000''>different cases, although both of them had the</span> <span
  m=''1935000''>identical looking solution. Their meaning in the physical</span> <span
  m=''1939000''>world was so different that they really should be considered as</span>
  <span m=''1944000''>solving the same equation. And, one of these was the case.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1950000''>Of the two, perhaps the more important was the case when
  k</span> <span m=''1954000''>was positive, and of course the other is when</span>
  <span m=''1958000''>k is negative. When k is positive,</span> <span m=''1961000''>that
  had the effect of separating that solution into</span> <span m=''1965000''>this
  part, which was a transient, and the other part,</span> <span m=''1969000''>which
  was a steady state. The steady state solution,</span> <span m=''1973000''>that was
  the yp part of it in that terminology.</span> </p><p><span m=''1977000''>And, the
  transient part, it was trangent because it went</span> <span m=''1982000''>to zero.
  If k is positive,</span> <span m=''1985000''>the exponential dies regardless of
  what c is.</span> </p><p><span m=''1989000''>So, the transient, that''s the yc part.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1992000''>It goes to zero as Ttgoes to infinity.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1996000''>The transient depends on, uses, the initial condition,</span> <span
  m=''2001000''>whatever it is, because that''s what determines</span> <span m=''2005000''>the
  value of c. On the other hand,</span> <span m=''2008000''>this initial condition
  makes no difference as t goes towards</span> <span m=''2013000''>infinity. All that''s
  left is this steady</span> <span m=''2018000''>state solution. And, all solutions
  tend to the</span> <span m=''2022000''>steady state solution. So, if k is positive,</span>
  <span m=''2026000''>one gets this analysis of the solutions into the sum of one</span>
  <span m=''2032000''>basic solution, and the others,</span> <span m=''2035000''>which
  just die away, have no influence on this,</span> <span m=''2039000''>less and less
  influence as time goes to infinity.</span> </p><p><span m=''2045000''>For k less
  than zero, this analysis does not work</span> <span m=''2049000''>because this term,
  if k is less than zero,</span> <span m=''2052000''>this term goes to infinity or
  negative infinity,</span> <span m=''2056000''>and typically tends to dominate that.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2059000''>So, it''s the start that the important one.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2063000''>It depends on the initial conditions, and the analysis is</span> <span
  m=''2068000''>meaningless. So, the above is meaningless.</span> </p><p><span m=''2073000''>And
  now, what I''d like to do is try to see what the analog of</span> <span m=''2079000''>that
  is for second order equations, and higher order</span> <span m=''2085000''>equations.
  If you understand second-order,</span> <span m=''2089000''>that''s good enough.
  Higher order goes exactly the</span> <span m=''2094000''>same way. So, the question
  is,</span> <span m=''2098000''>for second-order, let''s make it with constant</span>
  <span m=''2102000''>coefficients plus, I could call it b and k,</span> <span m=''2107000''>oh,
  no, b k, or p.</span> </p><p><span m=''2111000''>The trouble is, that wouldn''t
  take care of the</span> <span m=''2114000''>electrical circuits. So, I just want
  to use neutral</span> <span m=''2117000''>letters, which suggest nothing. And, you
  can make them turn it</span> <span m=''2122000''>into a circuit, so springs, or
  yet other</span> <span m=''2125000''>examples undreamt of. But these are constants.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2128000''>And I''m going to think of it as time.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2132000''>I think I''ll switch back to time, let x be the time.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2137000''>So, B y equals f of t. So, there is our equation.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2143000''>A and B are constants. And, the question is,</span> <span m=''2147000''>the
  question I''m asking, can think of either of these</span> <span m=''2153000''>two
  models or others, the question I''m asking is,</span> <span m=''2158000''>under
  what circumstances can I make that same type of analysis</span> <span m=''2164000''>into
  steady-state and transient? Well, what does the solution</span> <span m=''2171000''>look
  like? The solution looks like y</span> <span m=''2175000''>equals a particular solution
  plus c1 y1 plus c2 y2.</span> </p><p><span m=''2180000''>Therefore, to make that
  look</span> <span m=''2184000''>like this, the c1 and c2 contain the initial conditions.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2191000''>This part does not. Therefore, if I want to say</span>
  <span m=''2195000''>that the solutions look like a steady state solution plus</span>
  <span m=''2201000''>something that dies away, which becomes less and less</span>
  <span m=''2207000''>important as time goes on, what I''m really asking is,</span>
  <span m=''2212000''>under what circumstances is this part guaranteed to go to</span>
  <span m=''2218000''>zero? So, the question is,</span> <span m=''2221000''>when,
  in other words, under what conditions on the</span> <span m=''2226000''>equation
  A and B, in effect, is what we are</span> <span m=''2230000''>asking. When does
  c1 y1 plus c2 y2 go</span> <span m=''2234000''>to zero as t goes to infinity,</span>
  <span m=''2239000''>regardless of what c1 and c2 are for all c1 c2.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2245000''>Now, here there was no difficulty.</span> </p><p><span m=''2250000''>We
  had the thing very explicitly, and you could see k</span> <span m=''2254000''>is
  positive: this goes to zero. And if k is negative,</span> <span m=''2258000''>it
  doesn''t go to zero. It goes to infinity.</span> </p><p><span m=''2261000''>Here,
  I want to make the same kind of analysis,</span> <span m=''2264000''>except it''s
  just going to take, it''s a little more trouble.</span> </p><p><span m=''2269000''>But
  the answer, when it finally comes out is</span> <span m=''2272000''>very beautiful.
  So, when are all these guys</span> <span m=''2275000''>going to go to zero? First
  of all,</span> <span m=''2278000''>you might as well just have the definition.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2281000''>So, all the good things that this is going to imply,</span>
  <span m=''2285000''>if this is so, in other words,</span> <span m=''2287000''>if
  they all go to zero, everything in the complementary</span> <span m=''2292000''>solution,
  then the ODE is called stable.</span> </p><p><span m=''2297000''>Some people call
  it asymptotically stable.</span> </p><p><span m=''2301000''>I don''t know what to
  call it. I can make the analysis,</span> <span m=''2308000''>and then I use the
  identical terminology, c1 y1 plus c2 y2.</span> </p><p><span m=''2316000''>This
  is called the transient because it goes to zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''2320000''>This
  is called the particular solution now that we labored so</span> <span m=''2325000''>hard
  to get for the next two weeks.</span> </p><p><span m=''2327000''>It''s the important
  part. It''s the steady-state part.</span> </p><p><span m=''2332000''>It''s what
  lasts out to infinity after the other stuff has</span> <span m=''2336000''>disappeared.
  So, this is the steady-state</span> <span m=''2339000''>solution, steady-state solution,
  okay?</span> </p><p><span m=''2344000''>And, the differential equation is called
  stable.</span> </p><p><span m=''2347000''>Now, it''s of the highest interest to
  know when a</span> <span m=''2350000''>differential equation is stable, linear differential
  equation is</span> <span m=''2354000''>stable in this sense because you have a control.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2357000''>You know what its solutions look like.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2360000''>You have some feeling for how it''s behaving in the long term.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2364000''>If this is not so, each equation is a law unto</span>
  <span m=''2367000''>itself if you don''t know. So, let''s do the work.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2371000''>For the rest of the period, what I''d like to do is to find</span>
  <span m=''2376000''>out what the conditions are, which make this true.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2380000''>Those were the equations which we will have a right to call</span>
  <span m=''2385000''>stable. So, when does this happen,</span> <span m=''2388000''>and
  where is it going to happen?</span> </p><p><span m=''2390000''>I don''t know. I
  guess, here.</span> </p><p><span m=''2405000''>Now, I think the first step is fairly
  easy, and it will give</span> <span m=''2410000''>you a good review of what we''ve
  been doing up until now.</span> </p><p><span m=''2414000''>So, I''m simply going
  to make a case-by-case analysis.</span> </p><p><span m=''2419000''>Don''t worry,
  it won''t take very long.</span> </p><p><span m=''2422000''>What are the cases we''ve
  been studying?</span> </p><p><span m=''2425000''>Well, what do the characteristic
  roots look like?</span> </p><p><span m=''2429000''>The roots of the characteristic
  equation, in other words,</span> <span m=''2434000''>remember, there are cases.
  The first case is they are real</span> <span m=''2441000''>and distinct, r1 not
  equal to r2,</span> <span m=''2445000''>real and distinct. What are the other cases?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2450000''>Well, r1 equals r2. And then, there''s the case</span>
  <span m=''2456000''>where there are complex. So, I will write it r equals a</span>
  <span m=''2462000''>plus or minus b i. What do the solutions look</span> <span m=''2467000''>like?
  So, my ham-handed approach to</span> <span m=''2469000''>this problem is going to
  be, in each case,</span> <span m=''2472000''>I''ll look at the solutions, and first
  get the condition on</span> <span m=''2476000''>the roots. So, in other words,</span>
  <span m=''2478000''>I''m not going to worry right away about the a and the b.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2481000''>I''m going, instead, to worry about expressing this</span>
  <span m=''2484000''>condition of stability in terms of the characteristic roots.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2488000''>In fact, that''s the only way in which many people know
  the</span> <span m=''2492000''>conditions. You''re going to be smarter.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2495000''>Okay, what do the solutions look like?</span> </p><p><span m=''2498000''>Well,
  the general solution looks like e to the r1 t plus c2</span> <span m=''2502000''>e
  to the r2 t.</span> </p><p><span m=''2505000''>Okay, so, what''s the stability condition?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2508000''>In other words, if equation happened to have</span> <span
  m=''2511000''>its characteristic roots, real and distinct,</span> <span m=''2514000''>under
  what circumstances would it be stable?</span> </p><p><span m=''2517000''>Would it,
  in other words, all its solutions go to zero?</span> </p><p><span m=''2521000''>So,
  I''m talking about the homogeneous equation,</span> <span m=''2524000''>the reduced
  equation, the associated homogeneous</span> <span m=''2527000''>equation. Why?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2530000''>Because that''s all that''s involved in this.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2533000''>In other words, when I write that,</span> <span m=''2535000''>I
  am no longer interested in the whole equation.</span> </p><p><span m=''2539000''>All
  I''m interested in is the reduced equation,</span> <span m=''2542000''>the equation
  where you turn the f of t on the</span> <span m=''2546000''>right-hand side into
  zero. So, what''s the stability</span> <span m=''2551000''>condition? Well, let''s
  write it out.</span> </p><p><span m=''2555000''>Under what circumstances will all
  these guys go to zero?</span> </p><p><span m=''2561000''>If r1 and r2 should be
  negative, can they be zero?</span> </p><p><span m=''2566000''>No, because then it
  will be a constant and it will go to zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''2572000''>How
  about this one? Well, in this one,</span> <span m=''2576000''>it''s (c1 plus c2
  times t) multiplied by e to the r1 t.</span> </p><p><span m=''2581000''>Of course,
  both of these are</span> <span m=''2588000''>the same. I''ll just arbitrarily pick
  one</span> <span m=''2591000''>of them. What happens to this as things</span> <span
  m=''2594000''>go to zero? Well, this part is rising,</span> <span m=''2596000''>at
  least if c2 is positive. This part is either helping or</span> <span m=''2601000''>it''s
  hindering. But, I hope you know what these</span> <span m=''2604000''>functions
  look like, and you know which of them go</span> <span m=''2608000''>to zero. They
  go to zero if r1 is</span> <span m=''2611000''>negative. It might rise in the beginning,</span>
  <span m=''2615000''>but after a while they lose the energy.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2619000''>Of course, if r1 is equal to zero, what do these guys do?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2624000''>Linear, go to infinity. Well, we are doing okay.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2629000''>How about here? Well, here, it''s a little more</span> <span m=''2633000''>complicated.
  The solutions look like e to</span> <span m=''2637000''>the at times (c1 cosine
  bt plus c2 sine bt).</span> </p><p><span m=''2643000''>Now, this part is a pure</span>
  <span m=''2647000''>oscillation. You know that.</span> </p><p><span m=''2649000''>It
  might have a big amplitude, but whatever it does,</span> <span m=''2653000''>it
  does the same thing all the time.</span> </p><p><span m=''2656000''>So, whether
  this goes to zero depends entirely upon what that</span> <span m=''2660000''>exponential
  is doing. And, that exponential goes to</span> <span m=''2664000''>zero if a is
  negative. So here, the condition is</span> <span m=''2668000''>negative. And now,
  the only thing left to</span> <span m=''2673000''>do is to say it nicely. I''ve
  got three cases,</span> <span m=''2678000''>and I want to say them all in one breath.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2683000''>So, the stability condition is, the ODE is stable.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2689000''>So, this is, or f of t.</span> </p><p><span m=''2693000''>It
  doesn''t matter. But, psychologically,</span> <span m=''2697000''>you can put this
  as zero there, is stable if what?</span> </p><p><span m=''2705000''>In case one,
  this is true.</span> </p><p><span m=''2707000''>In case two, that''s true.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2710000''>In case three, that''s true.</span> </p><p><span m=''2713000''>But
  that''s ugly. Make it beautiful.</span> </p><p><span m=''2717000''>The beautiful
  way of saying it is if all the characteristic</span> <span m=''2723000''>roots have
  negative real parts. If the characteristic roots,</span> <span m=''2731000''>the
  r''s or the a plus or minus b i, have negative real part.</span> </p><p><span m=''2738000''>That''s
  the form in which the electrical engineers will nod</span> <span m=''2744000''>their
  head, tell you, yeah, that''s right,</span> <span m=''2749000''>negative real part,
  sorry.</span> </p><p><span m=''2752000''>Isn''t it right? Is that right here?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2756000''>Yeah. What''s the real part of these</span> <span m=''2759000''>guys?
  They themselves,</span> <span m=''2763000''>because they are real. What''s the real
  part of this?</span> </p><p><span m=''2769000''>Yeah. The only case in which I really</span>
  <span m=''2773000''>had to use real part is when I talk about the complex case</span>
  <span m=''2780000''>because a is just the real part of a complex number.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2786000''>It''s not the whole thing.</span> </p>'
