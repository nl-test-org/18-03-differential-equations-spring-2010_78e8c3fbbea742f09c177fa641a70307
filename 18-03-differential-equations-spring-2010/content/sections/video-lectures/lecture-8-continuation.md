transcript: '<p><span m=''1000''>I usually like to start a lecture with something
  new,</span> <span m=''4000''>but this time I''m going to make an exception,</span>
  <span m=''7000''>and start with the finishing up on Friday because it involves a</span>
  <span m=''11000''>little more practice with complex numbers.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''14000''>I think that''s what a large number of you are still fairly</span> <span
  m=''18000''>weak in. So, to briefly remind you,</span> <span m=''20000''>it will
  be sort of self-contained,</span> <span m=''23000''>but still, it will use complex
  numbers.</span> </p><p><span m=''25000''>And, I think it''s a good way to start
  today.</span> </p><p><span m=''30000''>So, remember, the basic problem was to solve</span>
  <span m=''33000''>something with, where the input was sinusoidal</span> <span m=''38000''>in
  particular. The k was on both sides,</span> <span m=''41000''>and the input looked
  like cosine omega t.</span> </p><p><span m=''46000''>And, the plan of the solution
  consisted of transporting the</span> <span m=''52000''>problem to the complex domain.
  So, you look for a complex</span> <span m=''57000''>solution, and you complexify
  the right hand side of the equation,</span> <span m=''62000''>as well. So, cosine
  omega t</span> <span m=''67000''>becomes the real part of this complex function.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''71000''>The reason for doing that, remember, was because it''s</span>
  <span m=''75000''>easier to handle when you solve linear equations.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''79000''>It''s much easier to handle exponentials on the right-hand</span> <span
  m=''83000''>side than it is to handle sines and cosines because exponentials</span>
  <span m=''88000''>are so easy to integrate when you multiply them by other</span>
  <span m=''93000''>exponentials. So, the result was,</span> <span m=''95000''>after
  doing that, y tilda turned out to be one,</span> <span m=''99000''>after I scale
  the coefficient, one over one plus omega over k</span> <span m=''104000''>And then,
  the rest was e to the</span> <span m=''111000''>i times (omega t minus phi),</span>
  <span m=''116000''>where phi had a certain meaning.</span> </p><p><span m=''120000''>It
  was the arc tangent of a, it was a phase lag.</span> </p><p><span m=''126000''>And,
  this was then, I had to take the real part of</span> <span m=''129000''>this to
  get the final answer, which came out to be something</span> <span m=''133000''>like
  one over the square root of one plus the amplitude one omega</span> <span m=''138000''>/
  k squared, and then the rest was cosine omega t plus minus</span> <span m=''142000''>phi.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''146000''>It''s easier to see that that part is the real part of
  this;</span> <span m=''150000''>the problem is, of course you have to convert</span>
  <span m=''153000''>this. Sorry, this should be i omega</span> <span m=''157000''>t,
  in which case you don''t need the parentheses,</span> <span m=''161000''>either.
  So, the problem was to use the</span> <span m=''165000''>polar representation of
  this complex number to convert it</span> <span m=''170000''>into something whose
  amplitude was this, and whose angle was</span> <span m=''175000''>minus phi. Now,
  that''s what we call the</span> <span m=''178000''>polar method, going polar.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''182000''>I''d like, now, for the first few minutes of</span> <span
  m=''184000''>the period, to talk about the other method,</span> <span m=''187000''>the
  Cartesian method. I think for a long while,</span> <span m=''190000''>many of you
  will be more comfortable with that anyway.</span> </p><p><span m=''194000''>Although,
  one of the objects of the course should be to get you</span> <span m=''198000''>equally
  comfortable with the polar representation of complex</span> <span m=''202000''>numbers.
  So, if we try to do the same</span> <span m=''205000''>thing going Cartesian, what''s
  going to happen?</span> </p><p><span m=''208000''>Well, I guess the same point here.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''212000''>So, the starting point is still y tilde equals one over,</span>
  <span m=''217000''>sorry, this should have an i here, one plus i times omega</span>
  <span m=''222000''>over k, e to the i omega t.</span> </p><p><span m=''228000''>But
  now, what you''re going to</span> <span m=''232000''>do is turn this into its Cartesian,
  turn both of these</span> <span m=''237000''>into their Cartesian representations
  as a plus ib.</span> </p><p><span m=''242000''>So, if you do that Cartesianly,</span>
  <span m=''246000''>of course, what you have to do is the standard thing about</span>
  <span m=''249000''>dividing complex numbers or taking the reciprocals that I</span>
  <span m=''253000''>told you at the very beginning of complex numbers.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''256000''>You multiply the top and bottom by the complex conjugate of this</span>
  <span m=''261000''>in order to make the bottom real.</span> </p><p><span m=''263000''>So,
  what does this become? This becomes one minus i times</span> <span m=''267000''>omega
  over k divided by the product of this in its complex</span> <span m=''270000''>conjugate,
  which is the real number, one plus omega over k</span> <span m=''274000''>squared</span>
  <span m=''279000''>So, I''ve now converted this to the a plus bi form.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''283000''>I have also to convert the right-hand side to the a plus bi</span>
  <span m=''287000''>form. So, it will look like cosine</span> <span m=''289000''>omega
  t plus i sine omega t.</span> </p><p><span m=''293000''>Having done that,</span>
  <span m=''295000''>I take the last step, which is to take the real part</span> <span
  m=''299000''>of that. Remember, the reason I want the</span> <span m=''301000''>real
  part is because this input was the real part of the complex</span> <span m=''306000''>input.
  So, once you''ve got the complex</span> <span m=''310000''>solution, you have to
  take its real part to go back into the</span> <span m=''314000''>domain you started
  with, of real numbers,</span> <span m=''317000''>from the domain of complex numbers.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''319000''>So, I want the real part is going to be, the real part
  of</span> <span m=''323000''>that is, first of all, there''s a factor out in front.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''327000''>That''s entirely real. Let''s put that out in front,</span>
  <span m=''332000''>so doesn''t bother us particularly.</span> </p><p><span m=''334000''>And
  now, I need the product of this complex number and that</span> <span m=''339000''>complex
  number. But, I only want the real part</span> <span m=''342000''>of it. So, I''m
  not going to multiply</span> <span m=''345000''>it out and get four terms. I''m
  just going to look at the</span> <span m=''349000''>two terms that I do want. I
  don''t want the others.</span> </p><p><span m=''353000''>All right, the real part
  is cosine omega t,</span> <span m=''358000''>from the product of this and that.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''362000''>And, the rest of the real part will be the product of
  the two i</span> <span m=''367000''>terms. But, it''s i times negative i,</span>
  <span m=''371000''>which makes one. And therefore,</span> <span m=''373000''>it''s
  omega over k times sine omega t.</span> </p><p><span m=''378000''>Now, that''s the
  answer.</span> </p><p><span m=''382000''>And that''s the answer, too; they must
  be equal,</span> <span m=''386000''>unless there''s a contradiction in mathematics.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''392000''>But, it''s extremely important. And that''s the other
  reason why</span> <span m=''396000''>I''m giving you this, that you learn in this
  course</span> <span m=''400000''>to be able to convert quickly and automatically
  things that</span> <span m=''404000''>look like this into things that look like
  that.</span> </p><p><span m=''407000''>And, that''s done by means of a basic formula,</span>
  <span m=''410000''>which occurs at the end of the notes for reference,</span> <span
  m=''414000''>as I optimistically say, although I think for a lot of</span> <span
  m=''418000''>you will not be referenced, stuff in the category of,</span> <span
  m=''422000''>yeah, I think I''ve vaguely seen that somewhere.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''427000''>But, well, we never used it for anything.</span> </p><p><span m=''430000''>Okay,
  you''re going to use it all term.</span> </p><p><span m=''432000''>So, the formula
  is, the famous trigonometric</span> <span m=''436000''>identity, which is, so, the
  problem is to convert</span> <span m=''439000''>this into the other guy. And, the
  thing which is going</span> <span m=''444000''>to do that, enable one to combine
  the sine and the cosine</span> <span m=''448000''>terms, is the famous formula that
  a times the cosine,</span> <span m=''452000''>I''m going to use theta to make it
  as neutral as possible,</span> <span m=''456000''>-- -- so, theta you can think
  of</span> <span m=''460000''>as being replaced by omega t in this particular application
  of</span> <span m=''464000''>the formula. But, I''ll just use a general</span> <span
  m=''467000''>angle theta, which doesn''t suggest anything in particular.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''471000''>So, the problem is, you have something which is a</span>
  <span m=''474000''>combination with real coefficients of cosine and sine,</span>
  <span m=''478000''>and the important thing is that these numbers be the same.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''483000''>In practice, that means that the omega t,</span> <span
  m=''486000''>you''re not allowed to have omega one t here,</span> <span m=''490000''>and
  some other frequency, omega two t here.</span> </p><p><span m=''494000''>That would
  correspond to using theta one here,</span> <span m=''497000''>and theta two here.
  And, though there is a formula</span> <span m=''501000''>for combining that, nobody
  remembers it,</span> <span m=''504000''>and it''s, in general, less universally
  useful than</span> <span m=''508000''>the first. If you''re going to memorize a</span>
  <span m=''512000''>formula, and learn this one, it''s best to start with the</span>
  <span m=''518000''>ones where the two are equal. That''s the basic formula.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''524000''>The others are variations of it, but there is a sizable</span>
  <span m=''529000''>variations. All right, so the answer is</span> <span m=''533000''>that
  this is equal to some other constant, real constant,</span> <span m=''539000''>times
  the cosine of theta minus phi.</span> </p><p><span m=''546000''>Of course, most
  people remember this vaguely.</span> </p><p><span m=''549000''>What they don''t
  remember is what the c and the phi are,</span> <span m=''554000''>how to calculate
  them. I don''t suggest you memorize</span> <span m=''558000''>the formulas for them.
  You can if you wish.</span> </p><p><span m=''562000''>Instead, memorize the picture,
  which is much easier.</span> </p><p><span m=''566000''>Memorize that a and b are
  the two sides of a right triangle.</span> </p><p><span m=''571000''>Phi is the angle
  opposite the b side, and c is the length of the</span> <span m=''576000''>hypotenuse.
  Okay, that''s worth putting up.</span> </p><p><span m=''582000''>I think that''s
  a pink formula. It''s even worth two of those,</span> <span m=''588000''>but I will
  thrift. Now, let''s apply it to this</span> <span m=''592000''>case to see that
  it gives the right answer.</span> </p><p><span m=''597000''>So, to use this formula,
  how I use it?</span> </p><p><span m=''602000''>Well, I should take, I will reproduce
  the left-hand</span> <span m=''607000''>side. So that part,</span> <span m=''609000''>I
  just copy. And, how about the right?</span> </p><p><span m=''613000''>Well, the
  amplitude, it''s combined into a single</span> <span m=''619000''>cosine term whose
  amplitude is, well, the two sides of the</span> <span m=''625000''>right triangle
  are one, and omega over k.</span> </p><p><span m=''633000''>The hypotenuse in that
  case is going to be, well,</span> <span m=''636000''>why don''t we write it here?
  So, we have one,</span> <span m=''639000''>and omega over k. And, here''s phi.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''643000''>So, the hypotenuse is going to be the square root of one
  plus</span> <span m=''647000''>omega over k squared.</span> </p><p><span m=''651000''>And,
  that''s going to be multiplied by the cosine of</span> <span m=''655000''>omega
  t minus this phase lag angle phi.</span> </p><p><span m=''659000''>You can write,</span>
  <span m=''662000''>if you wish, phi equals the arc tangent,</span> <span m=''665000''>but
  you are not learning a lot by that.</span> </p><p><span m=''669000''>Phi is the
  arc tangent of omega over k.</span> </p><p><span m=''675000''>That''s okay,</span>
  <span m=''676000''>but it''s true. But, notice there''s</span> <span m=''679000''>cancellation
  now. This over that is equal to</span> <span m=''683000''>what? Well, it''s equal
  to this.</span> </p><p><span m=''688000''>And, so when we get in this way, by combining
  these two</span> <span m=''691000''>factors, one gets exactly the same formula that
  we got before.</span> </p><p><span m=''696000''>So, as you can see, in some sense,</span>
  <span m=''698000''>there''s not, if you can remember this</span> <span m=''701000''>trigonometric
  identity, there''s not a lot of difference</span> <span m=''705000''>between the
  two methods except that this one requires this</span> <span m=''709000''>extra step.
  The answer will come out in</span> <span m=''711000''>this form, and you then, to
  see what it really looks</span> <span m=''715000''>like, really have to convert
  it to this form,</span> <span m=''718000''>the form in which you can see what the
  phase lag and the</span> <span m=''722000''>amplitude is. It''s amazing how many
  people</span> <span m=''727000''>who should know, this includes working</span> <span
  m=''730000''>mathematicians, theoretical mathematicians,</span> <span m=''733000''>includes
  even possibly the authors of your textbooks.</span> </p><p><span m=''737000''>I''m
  not sure, but I''ve caught them in this,</span> <span m=''740000''>too, who in this
  form, everybody remembers that it''s</span> <span m=''744000''>something like that.
  Unfortunately,</span> <span m=''747000''>when it occurs as the answer in an answer
  book,</span> <span m=''751000''>the numbers are some colossal mess here plus some
  colossal</span> <span m=''755000''>mess here. And theta is,</span> <span m=''759000''>again,
  a real mess, involving roots and some cube</span> <span m=''764000''>roots, and
  whatnot. The only thing is,</span> <span m=''768000''>these two are the same real
  mess.</span> </p><p><span m=''772000''>That amounts to just another pure oscillation
  with the same</span> <span m=''778000''>frequency as the old guy, and with the amplitude
  changed,</span> <span m=''785000''>and with a phase shift, move to the right or
  left.</span> </p><p><span m=''792000''>So, this is no more general than that.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''794000''>Notice they both have two parameters in them,</span> <span
  m=''798000''>these two coefficients. This one has the two parameters</span> <span
  m=''802000''>in an altered form. Okay, well, I wanted,</span> <span m=''806000''>because
  of the importance of this formula,</span> <span m=''809000''>I wanted to take a
  couple of minutes out for a proof of the</span> <span m=''814000''>formula, --</span>
  <span m=''822000''>-- just to give you chance to stare at it a little more now.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''826000''>There are three proofs I know. I''m sure there are 27.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''830000''>The Pythagorean theorem now has several hundred.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''833000''>But, there are three basic proofs.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''836000''>There is the one I will not give you, I''ll call the high</span> <span
  m=''840000''>school proof, which is the only one one</span> <span m=''843000''>normally
  finds in books, physics textbooks or other</span> <span m=''847000''>textbooks.
  The high school proof takes the</span> <span m=''851000''>right-hand side, applies
  the formula for the</span> <span m=''854000''>cosine of the difference of two angles,
  which it assumes you had</span> <span m=''859000''>in trigonometry, and then converts
  it into this.</span> </p><p><span m=''862000''>It shows you that once you''ve done
  that, that a turns out to</span> <span m=''867000''>be c cosine phi and b, the number
  b is c sine</span> <span m=''871000''>phi, and therefore it identifies the</span>
  <span m=''875000''>two sides. Now, the thing that''s of course</span> <span m=''879000''>correct
  and it''s the simplest possible argument,</span> <span m=''882000''>the thing that''s
  no good about it is that the direction at</span> <span m=''887000''>which it goes
  is from here to here.</span> </p><p><span m=''889000''>Well, everybody knew that.
  If I gave you this and told</span> <span m=''893000''>you, write it out in terms
  of cosine and sine,</span> <span m=''896000''>I would assume it dearly hope that
  practically all of you can</span> <span m=''901000''>do that. Unfortunately,</span>
  <span m=''903000''>when you want to use the formula, it''s this way you want</span>
  <span m=''907000''>to use it in the opposite direction.</span> </p><p><span m=''909000''>You
  are starting with this, and want to convert it to that.</span> </p><p><span m=''913000''>Now,
  the proof, therefore, will not be of much</span> <span m=''915000''>help. It requires
  you to go in the</span> <span m=''917000''>backwards direction, and match up coefficients.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''920000''>It''s much better to go forwards.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''922000''>Now, there are two proofs that go forwards.</span> </p><p><span m=''925000''>There''s
  the 18.02 proof. Since I didn''t teach most of</span> <span m=''928000''>you 18.02,
  I can''t be sure you had it.</span> </p><p><span m=''932000''>So, I''ll spend one
  minute giving it to you.</span> </p><p><span m=''936000''>What is the 18.02 proof?
  It is the following picture.</span> </p><p><span m=''942000''>I think this requires
  deep colored chalk.</span> </p><p><span m=''946000''>This is going to be pretty
  heavy.</span> </p><p><span m=''950000''>All right, first of all, the a and the b
  are the given.</span> </p><p><span m=''955000''>So, I''m going to put in that vector.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''961000''>So, there is the vector whose sides are, whose components
  are</span> <span m=''965000''>a and b. I''ll write it without the i and</span> <span
  m=''968000''>j. I hope you had from Jerison</span> <span m=''971000''>that form
  for the vector, if you don''t like that,</span> <span m=''974000''>write ai plus
  bj, okay?</span> </p><p><span m=''977000''>Now, there''s another vector lurking
  around.</span> </p><p><span m=''980000''>It''s the unit vector whose, I''ll write
  it this way,</span> <span m=''984000''>u because it''s a unit vector, and theta
  to indicate that it''s</span> <span m=''989000''>angle is theta. Now, the reason
  for doing that</span> <span m=''994000''>is because you see that the left-hand side
  is a dot product</span> <span m=''998000''>of two vectors. The left-hand side of
  the</span> <span m=''1001000''>identity is the dot product of the vector <a,</span>
  <span m=''1005000''>b> with the vector whose components are cosine theta and</span>
  <span m=''1009000''>sine theta.</span> </p><p><span m=''1012000''>That''s what I''m
  calling this unit vector.</span> </p><p><span m=''1015000''>It''s a unit vector
  because cosine squared plus sine squared</span> <span m=''1019000''>is one.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1024000''>Now, all this formula is, is saying that scalar product,</span>
  <span m=''1028000''>the dot product of those two vectors, can be evaluated if you</span>
  <span m=''1033000''>know their components by the left-hand side of the formula.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1038000''>And, if you don''t know their components, it can be evaluated</span>
  <span m=''1044000''>in another way, the geometric evaluation,</span> <span m=''1047000''>which
  goes, what is it? It''s a magnitude of one,</span> <span m=''1051000''>times the
  magnitude of the other, times the cosine of the</span> <span m=''1056000''>included
  angle. Now, what''s the included angle?</span> </p><p><span m=''1062000''>Well,
  theta is this angle from the horizontal to that unit</span> <span m=''1069000''>vector.
  The angle phi is this angle,</span> <span m=''1074000''>from this picture here.
  And therefore,</span> <span m=''1078000''>the included angle between (u)theta and
  my pink vector is</span> <span m=''1085000''>theta minus phi. That''s the formula.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1092000''>It comes from two ways of calculating the scalar product</span>
  <span m=''1096000''>of the vector whose coefficients are, and the unit vector</span>
  <span m=''1101000''>whose components are cosine theta and sine theta.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1105000''>All right, well,</span> <span m=''1108000''>you should, that was 18.02.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1115000''>There must be an 18.03 proof also. Yes.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1116000''>What''s the 18.03 proof? The 18.03 proof uses complex</span> <span
  m=''1123000''>numbers. It says, look,</span> <span m=''1126000''>take the left side.
  Instead of viewing it as the</span> <span m=''1133000''>dot product of two vectors,
  there''s another way.</span> </p><p><span m=''1142000''>You can think of it as the
  part of the products of two complex</span> <span m=''1146000''>numbers. So, the
  18.03 argument,</span> <span m=''1149000''>really, the complex number argument says,</span>
  <span m=''1152000''>look, multiply together a minus bi and the complex</span> <span
  m=''1157000''>number cosine theta plus i sine theta.</span> </p><p><span m=''1161000''>There
  are different ways of</span> <span m=''1164000''>explaining why I want to put the
  minus i there instead of i.</span> </p><p><span m=''1168000''>But, the simplest
  is because I want, when I take the real part,</span> <span m=''1173000''>to get
  the left-hand side. I will.</span> </p><p><span m=''1177000''>If I take the real
  part of this, I''m going to get a cosine</span> <span m=''1182000''>theta plus b
  sine theta</span> <span m=''1186000''>because of negative i and i make one,</span>
  <span m=''1191000''>multiplied together. All right, that''s the left-hand</span>
  <span m=''1195000''>side. And now, the right-hand side,</span> <span m=''1198000''>I''m
  going to use polar representation instead.</span> </p><p><span m=''1203000''>What''s
  the polar representation of this guy?</span> </p><p><span m=''1206000''>Well, if
  <a, b> has the angle theta,</span> <span m=''1209000''>then a negative b, a minus
  bi goes down</span> <span m=''1213000''>below. It has the angle minus phi.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1216000''>So, this is, has magnitude.</span> </p><p><span m=''1218000''>It
  is polar representation. Its magnitude is a squared plus</span> <span m=''1223000''>b
  squared, and its angle is negative phi,</span> <span m=''1227000''>not positive
  phi because this a minus bi goes below</span> <span m=''1232000''>the axis if a
  and b are positive.</span> </p><p><span m=''1236000''>So, it''s e to the minus i
  phi.</span> </p><p><span m=''1239000''>That''s the first guy. And, how about the
  second guy?</span> </p><p><span m=''1243000''>Well, the second guy is e to the i
  theta.</span> </p><p><span m=''1247000''>So, what''s the product? It is a squared
  plus b squared,</span> <span m=''1251000''>the square root, times e to the i times
  (theta</span> <span m=''1254000''>minus phi).</span> </p><p><span m=''1258000''>And
  now, what do I want? The real part of this,</span> <span m=''1261000''>and I want
  the real part of this.</span> </p><p><span m=''1265000''>So, let''s just say take
  the real parts of both sides.</span> </p><p><span m=''1268000''>If I take the real
  part of the left-hand side,</span> <span m=''1271000''>I get a cosine theta plus
  b sine theta.</span> </p><p><span m=''1274000''>If I take a real part of this</span>
  <span m=''1277000''>side, I get square root of a squared plus b squared times e,</span>
  <span m=''1281000''>times the cosine, that''s the real part,</span> <span m=''1283000''>right,
  of theta minus phi, which is just what it''s</span> <span m=''1286000''>supposed
  to be.</span> </p><p><span m=''1291000''>Well, with three different arguments, I''m
  really pounding</span> <span m=''1295000''>the table on this formula. But, I think
  there''s something</span> <span m=''1300000''>to be learned from at least two of
  them.</span> </p><p><span m=''1304000''>And, you know, I''m still, for awhile,</span>
  <span m=''1307000''>I will never miss an opportunity to bang complex</span> <span
  m=''1311000''>numbers into your head because, in some sense,</span> <span m=''1315000''>you
  have to reproduce the experience of the race.</span> </p><p><span m=''1321000''>As
  I mentioned in the notes, it took mathematicians 300 or</span> <span m=''1324000''>400
  years to get used to complex numbers.</span> </p><p><span m=''1327000''>So, if it
  takes you three or four weeks, that''s not too bad.</span> </p><p><span m=''1352000''>Now,
  for the rest of the period I''d like to go back to the</span> <span m=''1356000''>linear
  equations, and try to put into perspective</span> <span m=''1360000''>and summarize,
  and tell you a couple of things</span> <span m=''1363000''>which I had to leave
  out, but which are,</span> <span m=''1366000''>in my view, extremely important.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1368000''>And, up to now, I don''t want to leave you with</span>
  <span m=''1372000''>any misapprehensions. So, I''m going to summarize this</span>
  <span m=''1376000''>way, whereas last lecture I went from the most general equation</span>
  <span m=''1381000''>to the most special. I''d like to just write them</span> <span
  m=''1386000''>down in the reverse order, now.</span> </p><p><span m=''1389000''>So,
  we are talking about basic linear equations.</span> </p><p><span m=''1393000''>First
  order, of course, we haven''t moved as</span> <span m=''1396000''>a second order
  yet. So, the most special one,</span> <span m=''1400000''>and the one we talked
  about essentially all of the previous</span> <span m=''1405000''>two times, or last
  Friday, anyway, was the equation where</span> <span m=''1410000''>the k, the coefficient
  of y, is constant,</span> <span m=''1414000''>and where you also get it on the right-hand
  side quite</span> <span m=''1419000''>providentially. So, this is the most special</span>
  <span m=''1424000''>form, and it''s the one which governed what I will call the</span>
  <span m=''1428000''>temperature-concentration model, or if you want to be grown
  up,</span> <span m=''1433000''>the conduction-diffusion model, conduction-diffusion
  which</span> <span m=''1437000''>describes the processes, which the equation is
  modeling,</span> <span m=''1441000''>whereas these simply described the variables
  of things,</span> <span m=''1445000''>which you usually are trying to calculate
  when you use the</span> <span m=''1450000''>equation. Now, there are a class of</span>
  <span m=''1453000''>things where the thing is constant, but where the k does</span>
  <span m=''1457000''>not appear naturally on the right hand side.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1460000''>And, you''re going to encounter them pretty quickly in physics,</span>
  <span m=''1464000''>for one place. So, I better not try to sweep</span> <span m=''1467000''>those
  under the rug. Let''s just call that q of t.</span> </p><p><span m=''1472000''>And
  finally, there is the most general case,</span> <span m=''1476000''>where you allow
  k to be non-constant.</span> </p><p><span m=''1480000''>That''s the one we began,
  when we talked about the linear</span> <span m=''1485000''>equation. And you know
  how to solve it in</span> <span m=''1489000''>general by a definite or an indefinite
  integral.</span> </p><p><span m=''1494000''>Now, there''s one other thing, which
  I want to talk about.</span> </p><p><span m=''1501000''>I will do all these in a
  certain order.</span> </p><p><span m=''1503000''>But, from the beginning, you should
  keep in mind that</span> <span m=''1507000''>there''s another between the first
  two cases.</span> </p><p><span m=''1510000''>Between the first two cases, there''s
  another extremely</span> <span m=''1514000''>important distinction, and that is
  as to whether k is</span> <span m=''1518000''>positive or not. Up to now, we''ve
  always had k</span> <span m=''1521000''>positive. So, I''m going to put that here.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1524000''>So, it''s understood when I write these, that k is positive.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1530000''>I want to talk about that, too.</span> </p><p><span m=''1532000''>But,
  first things first. The first thing I wanted to do</span> <span m=''1536000''>was
  to show you that this, the first case,</span> <span m=''1539000''>the most special
  case, does not just apply to this.</span> </p><p><span m=''1543000''>It applies
  to other things, too.</span> </p><p><span m=''1545000''>Let me give you a mixing
  problem.</span> </p><p><span m=''1548000''>The typical mixing problem gives another
  example.</span> </p><p><span m=''1551000''>You''ve already done in recitation, and
  you did one for</span> <span m=''1555000''>the problem set, the problem of the two
  rooms</span> <span m=''1559000''>filled with smoke. But, let me do it just using</span>
  <span m=''1564000''>letters, so that the ideas stand out a little more clearly,</span>
  <span m=''1568000''>and you are not preoccupied with the numbers,</span> <span m=''1571000''>and
  calculating with the numbers, and trying to get</span> <span m=''1575000''>numerical
  examples. So, it''s as simple as k sub</span> <span m=''1579000''>mixing. It looks
  like this.</span> </p><p><span m=''1581000''>You have a tank, a room, I don''t know,</span>
  <span m=''1583000''>where everything''s getting mixed in.</span> </p><p><span m=''1586000''>It
  has a certain volume, which I will call v.</span> </p><p><span m=''1591000''>Something
  is flowing in, a gas or a liquid.</span> </p><p><span m=''1594000''>And, r will
  be the flow rate, in some units.</span> </p><p><span m=''1598000''>Now, since it
  can''t pile up inside this sealed container,</span> <span m=''1604000''>which I''m
  sure is full, the flow rate out must also be</span> <span m=''1609000''>r. And,
  what we''re interested in</span> <span m=''1611000''>is the amount of salt. So,
  x, let''s suppose these are</span> <span m=''1616000''>fluid flows, and the dissolved
  substance that I''m talking about</span> <span m=''1622000''>is not carbon monoxide,
  it''s salt, any dissolved</span> <span m=''1626000''>substance, some pollutant or
  whatever the problem calls for.</span> </p><p><span m=''1634000''>Let''s use salt.
  So, it''s the amount of salt in</span> <span m=''1640000''>the tank at time t. I''m
  interested in knowing how</span> <span m=''1648000''>that varies with time. Now,
  there''s nothing to be said</span> <span m=''1654000''>about how it flows out. What
  flows out,</span> <span m=''1656000''>of course, is what happens to be in the tank.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1659000''>But, I do have to say what flows in.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1661000''>Now, the only convenient way to describe the in-flow is in terms</span>
  <span m=''1666000''>of its concentration. The salt will be dissolved in</span> <span
  m=''1669000''>the in-flowing water, and so there will be a certain</span> <span
  m=''1672000''>concentration. And, as you will see,</span> <span m=''1675000''>for
  a secret reason, I''m going to give that the</span> <span m=''1678000''>subscript
  e. So, e is the concentration of</span> <span m=''1682000''>the incoming salt, in
  other words,</span> <span m=''1685000''>in the fluid, how many grams are there per</span>
  <span m=''1689000''>liter in the incoming fluid. That''s the data.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1693000''>So, this is the data. r is part of the data.</span> </p><p><span m=''1697000''>r
  is the flow rate. v is the volume.</span> </p><p><span m=''1700000''>I think I won''t
  bother writing that down, and the problem is to</span> <span m=''1705000''>determine
  what happens to x of t.</span> </p><p><span m=''1710000''>Now, I strongly recommend
  you not attempt to work directly</span> <span m=''1714000''>with the concentrations
  unless you feel you have a really good</span> <span m=''1719000''>physical feeling
  for concentrations.</span> </p><p><span m=''1722000''>I strongly recommend you work
  with a variable that you are</span> <span m=''1726000''>given, namely, the dependent
  variable,</span> <span m=''1729000''>which is the amount of salt, grams.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1732000''>Well, because it''s something you can physically think
  about.</span> </p><p><span m=''1737000''>It''s coming in, it''s getting mixed up,</span>
  <span m=''1740000''>and some of it is going out. So, the basic equation is going</span>
  <span m=''1748000''>to be that the rate of change of salt in the tank is the rate
  of</span> <span m=''1758000''>salt inflow, let me write salt inflow, minus the rate
  of salt</span> <span m=''1767000''>outflow. Okay, at what rate is salt</span> <span
  m=''1773000''>flowing in? Well, the flow rate is the flow</span> <span m=''1779000''>rate
  of the liquid. I multiply the flow rate,</span> <span m=''1783000''>1 L per minute
  times the concentration,</span> <span m=''1787000''>3 g per liter. That means 3
  g per minute.</span> </p><p><span m=''1791000''>It''s going to be, therefore, the
  product of the</span> <span m=''1796000''>flow rate and the concentration, incoming
  concentration.</span> </p><p><span m=''1803000''>How about the rate of the salt
  outflow?</span> </p><p><span m=''1805000''>Well, again, the rate of the liquid outflow</span>
  <span m=''1808000''>is r. And, what is the concentration</span> <span m=''1811000''>of
  salt in the outflow? I must use, when you talk flow</span> <span m=''1815000''>rates,
  the other factor must be the concentration,</span> <span m=''1818000''>not the amount.
  So, what is the concentration</span> <span m=''1822000''>in the outflow? Well, it''s
  the amount of salt</span> <span m=''1825000''>in the tank divided by its volume.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1829000''>So, the analog, the concentration here is x</span> <span
  m=''1832000''>divided by v. Now, here''s a typical messy</span> <span m=''1836000''>equation,
  dx / dt, let''s write it in the standard,</span> <span m=''1840000''>linear form,
  plus r times x over v equals r</span> <span m=''1844000''>times the given concentration,
  which is a function of time.</span> </p><p><span m=''1850000''>Now, this is going
  to be some given function,</span> <span m=''1854000''>and there will be no reason
  whatsoever why you can''t solve</span> <span m=''1859000''>it in that form. And,
  that''s normally what you</span> <span m=''1864000''>will do. Nonetheless,</span>
  <span m=''1865000''>in trying to understand how it fits into this paradigm,</span>
  <span m=''1869000''>which kind of equation is it? Well, clearly there''s an</span>
  <span m=''1872000''>awkwardness in that on the right-hand side,</span> <span m=''1875000''>we
  have concentration, and on the left-hand side,</span> <span m=''1879000''>we seem
  to have amounts. Now, the way to understand the</span> <span m=''1882000''>equation
  as opposed to the way to solve it, well,</span> <span m=''1886000''>it''s a step
  on the way to solving it.</span> </p><p><span m=''1888000''>But, I emphasize, you
  can and normally will solve</span> <span m=''1892000''>it in exactly that form.
  But, to understand what''s</span> <span m=''1896000''>happening, it''s better to
  express it in terms of</span> <span m=''1900000''>concentration entirely, and that''s
  why it''s called the</span> <span m=''1903000''>concentration, or the diffusion,</span>
  <span m=''1905000''>concentration-diffusion equation.</span> </p><p><span m=''1908000''>So,
  I''m going to convert this to concentrations.</span> </p><p><span m=''1911000''>Now,
  there''s no problem here. x over v is the concentration</span> <span m=''1915000''>in
  the tank. And now, immediately,</span> <span m=''1917000''>you see, hey, it looks
  like it''s going to</span> <span m=''1920000''>come out just in the first form.
  But, wait a minute.</span> </p><p><span m=''1926000''>How about the x? How do I
  convert that?</span> </p><p><span m=''1930000''>Well, what''s the relation between
  x?</span> </p><p><span m=''1933000''>So, if the concentration in the tank is equal
  to x over v,</span> <span m=''1939000''>so the tank concentration, then x is equal
  to C times the</span> <span m=''1945000''>constant, V, and dx / dt, therefore, will
  be c times dC /</span> <span m=''1951000''>dt. You see that?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1954000''>Now, that''s not in standard form.</span> </p><p><span m=''1958000''>Let''s
  put it in standard form. To put it in standard form,</span> <span m=''1964000''>I
  see, now, that it''s not r that''s the critical quantity.</span> </p><p><span m=''1971000''>It''s
  r divided by v. So, it''s dC / dt,</span> <span m=''1975000''>C prime, plus r divided
  by v, --</span> <span m=''1980000''>-- I''m going to call that k, k C, no let''s
  not,</span> <span m=''1984000''>r divided by v is equal to r divided by v times
  Ce.</span> </p><p><span m=''1989000''>That''s the equation expressed</span> <span
  m=''1994000''>in a form where the concentration is the dependent</span> <span m=''1998000''>variable,
  rather than the amount of salt itself.</span> </p><p><span m=''2003000''>And, you
  can see it falls exactly in this category.</span> </p><p><span m=''2007000''>That
  means that I can talk about it.</span> </p><p><span m=''2011000''>The natural way
  to talk about this equation is in terms of,</span> <span m=''2016000''>the same
  way we talked about the temperature equation.</span> </p><p><span m=''2023000''>I
  said concentration. I mean, that concentration has</span> <span m=''2027000''>nothing
  to do with this concentration.</span> </p><p><span m=''2030000''>This is the diffusion
  model, where salt solution outside,</span> <span m=''2034000''>cell in the middle,
  salt diffusing through a</span> <span m=''2038000''>semi-permeable membrane into
  that, uses Newton''s law of</span> <span m=''2043000''>diffusion, except he didn''t
  do a law of diffusion.</span> </p><p><span m=''2048000''>But, he is sticky. His
  name is attached to</span> <span m=''2050000''>everything. So, that''s this concentration</span>
  <span m=''2053000''>model. It''s the one entirely analogous</span> <span m=''2055000''>to
  the temperature. And the physical setup is the</span> <span m=''2058000''>same.
  This one is entirely different.</span> </p><p><span m=''2061000''>Mixing in this
  form of this problem has really nothing to do</span> <span m=''2064000''>with this
  model whatsoever. But, nor does that</span> <span m=''2067000''>concentration had
  anything to do with this concentration,</span> <span m=''2071000''>which refers
  to the result of the mixing in the tank.</span> </p><p><span m=''2076000''>But,
  what happens is the differential equation is the</span> <span m=''2080000''>same.
  The language of input and</span> <span m=''2083000''>response that we talked about
  is also available here.</span> </p><p><span m=''2087000''>So, everything is the
  same. And, the most interesting thing</span> <span m=''2092000''>is that it shows
  that the analog of the conductivity,</span> <span m=''2097000''>the k, the analog
  of conductivity and diffusivity is</span> <span m=''2101000''>this quantity. I should
  not be considering r</span> <span m=''2106000''>and v by themselves. I should be
  considering as the</span> <span m=''2111000''>basic quantity, the ratio of those
  two.</span> </p><p><span m=''2115000''>Now, why is that, is the basic parameter.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2119000''>What is this? Well, r is the rate of outflow,</span>
  <span m=''2123000''>and the rate of inflow, what''s r over v?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2127000''>r over v is the fractional rate of outflow.</span> </p><p><span m=''2131000''>In
  other words, if r over v is one tenth,</span> <span m=''2135000''>it means that
  1/10 of the tank will be emptied in a minute,</span> <span m=''2140000''>say. In
  other words,</span> <span m=''2144000''>we lumped these two constants into a single
  k,</span> <span m=''2149000''>and at the same time have simplified the units.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2153000''>What are the units? This is volume per minute.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2158000''>This is volume. So, it''s simply reciprocal</span> <span
  m=''2162000''>minutes, reciprocal time, which was the same units of</span> <span
  m=''2167000''>that diffusivity and conductivity had,</span> <span m=''2171000''>reciprocal
  time. The space variables have</span> <span m=''2176000''>entirely disappeared.
  So, it that way,</span> <span m=''2179000''>it''s simplified. It''s simplified conceptually,</span>
  <span m=''2182000''>and now, you can answer the same type of questions we asked</span>
  <span m=''2187000''>before about this. I think it would be better for</span> <span
  m=''2192000''>us to move on, though.</span> </p><p><span m=''2193000''>Well, just
  an example, one really simple thing,</span> <span m=''2197000''>so, suppose since
  we spent so much time worrying about what</span> <span m=''2201000''>was happening
  with sinusoid inputs, I mean,</span> <span m=''2205000''>when could Ce be sinusoidal,
  for example?</span> </p><p><span m=''2208000''>Well, roughly sinusoidal if, for
  example,</span> <span m=''2211000''>some factory were polluting. If this were a
  lake,</span> <span m=''2215000''>and some factory were polluting it, but in the
  beginning,</span> <span m=''2219000''>at the beginning of the day, they produced
  a lot of the</span> <span m=''2223000''>pollutant, and by the end of the day when
  it wound down,</span> <span m=''2227000''>it might well happen that the concentration
  of pollutants in</span> <span m=''2232000''>the incoming stream would vary sinusoidally
  with a 24 hour</span> <span m=''2236000''>cycle. And then, we would be asking,</span>
  <span m=''2242000''>so, suppose this varies sinusoidally.</span> </p><p><span m=''2246000''>In
  other words, it''s like cosine omega t.</span> </p><p><span m=''2251000''>I''m asking,
  how closely does</span> <span m=''2256000''>the concentration in the tank follow
  C sub e?</span> </p><p><span m=''2264000''>Now, what would that depend upon?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2268000''>Think about it. Well, the answer,</span> <span m=''2272000''>suppose
  k is large. Closely, let''s just analyze one</span> <span m=''2278000''>case, if
  k is big. Now, what would make k big?</span> </p><p><span m=''2283000''>We know
  that from the temperature thing.</span> </p><p><span m=''2286000''>If the conductivity
  is high, then the inner temperature will</span> <span m=''2290000''>follow the outer
  temperature closely, and the same thing with</span> <span m=''2295000''>the diffusion
  model. But we, of course,</span> <span m=''2297000''>therefore, since the equation
  is the same, we must get the</span> <span m=''2301000''>same result here. Now, what
  would make k big?</span> </p><p><span m=''2305000''>If r is big, if the flow rate
  is very fast,</span> <span m=''2308000''>we will expect the concentration of the
  inside of</span> <span m=''2311000''>that tank to match fairly closely the concentration
  of the</span> <span m=''2315000''>pollutant, of the incoming salt solution, or,</span>
  <span m=''2318000''>if the tank is very small. For fixed flow rates,</span> <span
  m=''2323000''>if the tank is very small, well, then it gets emptied</span> <span
  m=''2327000''>quickly. So, both of these are,</span> <span m=''2329000''>I think,
  intuitive results. And, of course,</span> <span m=''2332000''>as before, we got
  them from that, by trying to analyze the</span> <span m=''2336000''>final form of
  the solution. In other words,</span> <span m=''2339000''>we got them by looking
  at that form of the solution up there,</span> <span m=''2343000''>and seeing if
  k is big. As k increases,</span> <span m=''2347000''>what happens to the amplitude,
  and what happens to the phase</span> <span m=''2352000''>lag? But, that summarizes
  the two.</span> </p><p><span m=''2354000''>So, this means, closely means,</span>
  <span m=''2357000''>that the phase lag is, big or small?</span> </p><p><span m=''2360000''>The
  lag is small. And, the amplitude is,</span> <span m=''2363000''>well, the amplitude,
  the biggest the amplitude could</span> <span m=''2367000''>ever be is one because
  that''s the amplitude of this.</span> </p><p><span m=''2373000''>So, the amplitude
  is near one, one because that''s the</span> <span m=''2378000''>amplitude of the
  incoming signal, input,</span> <span m=''2381000''>whatever you want to call it.
  Okay, now, I''d like to spend</span> <span m=''2387000''>the rest of the time talking
  about the failures of number</span> <span m=''2392000''>one, and when you have to
  use number two, and when even number</span> <span m=''2398000''>two is no good.
  So, let me end first-order</span> <span m=''2403000''>equations by putting my worst
  foot forward.</span> </p><p><span m=''2408000''>Well, I''m just trying to avoid
  disappointment at</span> <span m=''2413000''>misapprehensions from you. I''ll watch
  you leave this room</span> <span m=''2419000''>and say, well, he said that,</span>
  <span m=''2422000''>okay. So, the first one you''re going</span> <span m=''2426000''>to
  encounter very shortly where one is not satisfied,</span> <span m=''2432000''>but
  two is, so on some examples where you need two,</span> <span m=''2438000''>well,
  it''s going to happen right here.</span> </p><p><span m=''2444000''>Somebody, sooner
  or later, it''s going to draw on that</span> <span m=''2447000''>loathsome orange
  chalk, which is unerasable,</span> <span m=''2450000''>something which looks like
  that.</span> </p><p><span m=''2452000''>Remember, you saw it here first.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2454000''>r, yeah, we had that. Okay, see, I had it in high</span>
  <span m=''2458000''>school too. That''s the capacitance.</span> </p><p><span m=''2460000''>This
  is the resistance. That''s the electromotive force:</span> <span m=''2464000''>battery,
  or a source of alternating current,</span> <span m=''2467000''>something like that.
  Now, of course,</span> <span m=''2471000''>what you''re interested in is how the
  current flows in the</span> <span m=''2475000''>circuit. Since current across the</span>
  <span m=''2478000''>capacitance doesn''t make sense, you have to talk about the</span>
  <span m=''2483000''>charge on the capacitance. So, q, it''s customary in a</span>
  <span m=''2487000''>circle this simple to use as the variable not current,</span>
  <span m=''2492000''>but the charge on the capacitance.</span> </p><p><span m=''2496000''>And
  then Kirchhoff''s, you are also supposed to know</span> <span m=''2500000''>that
  the derivative, that the time derivative of q</span> <span m=''2505000''>is what''s
  called the current in the circuit.</span> </p><p><span m=''2509000''>That sort of
  intuitive. But, i in a physics class,</span> <span m=''2513000''>j in an electrical
  engineering class, and why,</span> <span m=''2517000''>not the letter Y, but why
  is that?</span> </p><p><span m=''2522000''>That''s because of electrical engineers
  use lots of lots of</span> <span m=''2526000''>complex numbers and therefore, you
  have to call current j,</span> <span m=''2531000''>I guess. I think they do j in
  physics,</span> <span m=''2535000''>too, now. No, no they don''t.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2537000''>I don''t know. So, i is ambiguous if you are</span> <span m=''2541000''>in
  that particular subject. And it''s customary to use,</span> <span m=''2545000''>I
  don''t know. Now it''s completely safe.</span> </p><p><span m=''2549000''>Okay,
  where are we? Well, the law is,</span> <span m=''2552000''>the basic differential
  equation is Kirchhoff''s voltage law,</span> <span m=''2556000''>but the sum of
  the voltage drops across these three has to</span> <span m=''2560000''>be zero.
  So, it''s R times i,</span> <span m=''2562000''>which is dq / dt. That''s Ohm''s
  law.</span> </p><p><span m=''2564000''>That''s the voltage drop across resistance.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2567000''>The voltage drop across the capacitance is Coulomb''s
  law,</span> <span m=''2571000''>one form of Coulomb''s law. It''s q divided by C.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2575000''>And, that has to be the voltage drop.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2577000''>And then, there is some sign convention.</span> </p><p><span m=''2582000''>So,
  this is either plus or minus, depending on your sign</span> <span m=''2586000''>conventions,
  but it''s E of t. Now, if I put that in standard</span> <span m=''2591000''>form,
  in standard form I probably should say q prime plus</span> <span m=''2595000''>q
  over RC equals, well, I suppose,</span> <span m=''2598000''>E over R. And, this
  is what would appear</span> <span m=''2603000''>in the equation. But, it''s not
  the natural</span> <span m=''2606000''>thing. The k is one over RC.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2610000''>And, that''s the reciprocal.</span> </p><p><span m=''2612000''>The
  RC constant is what everybody knows is important</span> <span m=''2615000''>when
  you talk about a little circuit of that form.</span> </p><p><span m=''2619000''>On
  the other hand, the right-hand side,</span> <span m=''2621000''>it''s quite unnatural
  to try to stick in the right-hand side</span> <span m=''2626000''>that same RC.
  Call this EC over RC.</span> </p><p><span m=''2628000''>People don''t do that, and
  therefore,</span> <span m=''2630000''>it doesn''t really fall into the paradigm
  of that first equation.</span> </p><p><span m=''2635000''>It''s the second equation
  that really falls into the category.</span> </p><p><span m=''2639000''>Another simple
  example of this is chained to k,</span> <span m=''2642000''>radioactively changed
  to k. Well, let''s say the radioactive</span> <span m=''2648000''>substance, A,
  decays into,</span> <span m=''2650000''>let''s say, one atom of this produces one
  atom of that for</span> <span m=''2654000''>simplicity. So, it decays into B,</span>
  <span m=''2657000''>which then still is radioactive and decays further.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2661000''>Okay, what''s the differential equation, which is going to be,</span>
  <span m=''2666000''>it''s going to govern this situation?</span> </p><p><span m=''2669000''>What
  I want to know is how much B there is at any given time.</span> </p><p><span m=''2675000''>So,
  I want a differential equation for the quantity of the</span> <span m=''2679000''>radioactive
  product at any given time.</span> </p><p><span m=''2681000''>Well, what''s it going
  to look like?</span> </p><p><span m=''2684000''>Well, it''s the amount coming in
  minus the amount going out,</span> <span m=''2688000''>so to speak. The rate of
  inflow minus the</span> <span m=''2691000''>rate of outflow, except it''s not the
  same type</span> <span m=''2695000''>of physical flow we had before. How fast is
  it coming in?</span> </p><p><span m=''2699000''>Well, A is decaying at a certain
  rate,</span> <span m=''2701000''>and so the rate at which A decays is by the basic</span>
  <span m=''2705000''>radioactive law. It''s k1, it''s constant,</span> <span m=''2709000''>decay
  constant, times the amount of A present.</span> </p><p><span m=''2712000''>If I
  used the differential</span> <span m=''2715000''>equation with A here, I''d have
  to put a negative sign</span> <span m=''2718000''>because it''s the rate at which
  that stuff is leaving A.</span> </p><p><span m=''2722000''>But, I''m interested
  in the rate at which it''s coming in to B.</span> </p><p><span m=''2726000''>So,
  it has a positive sign. And then, the rate at which B</span> <span m=''2730000''>is
  decaying, and therefore the quantity of good B is gone,</span> <span m=''2734000''>--
  -- that will have some other</span> <span m=''2738000''>constant, B. So, that will
  be the equation,</span> <span m=''2741000''>and to avoid having two dependent variables
  in there,</span> <span m=''2746000''>we know how A is decaying. So, it''s k1,</span>
  <span m=''2749000''>some constant times A, sorry, A will be e to the</span> <span
  m=''2753000''>negative, you know, the decay law,</span> <span m=''2756000''>so,
  times the initial amount that was there times e to the</span> <span m=''2761000''>negative
  k1 t. That''s how much A there is at</span> <span m=''2767000''>any given time.
  It''s decaying by the</span> <span m=''2770000''>radioactive decay law, minus k2
  B.</span> </p><p><span m=''2774000''>Okay, so how does the differential equation
  look like?</span> </p><p><span m=''2778000''>It looks like B prime plus k2 B equals
  an exponential,</span> <span m=''2783000''>k1 A zero e to the negative k1 t.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2788000''>But, there''s no reason to</span> <span m=''2791000''>expect
  that that constant really has anything to do with k2.</span> </p><p><span m=''2796000''>It''s
  unnatural to put it in that form, which is the correct</span> <span m=''2801000''>one.
  Now, in the last two minutes,</span> <span m=''2809000''>I wish to alienate half
  the class by pointing out that if k</span> <span m=''2822000''>is less than zero,
  none of the terminology of</span> <span m=''2833000''>transient, steady-state input
  response applies.</span> </p><p><span m=''2845000''>The technique of solving the
  equation is identical.</span> </p><p><span m=''2848000''>But, you cannot interpret.
  So, the technique is the same,</span> <span m=''2853000''>and therefore it''s worth
  learning.</span> </p><p><span m=''2857000''>The technique is the same. In other
  words,</span> <span m=''2861000''>the solution will be still e to the negative kt
  integral q of t</span> <span m=''2868000''>e to the kt dt plus</span> <span m=''2874000''>a
  constant times e to the k, oh, this is terrible,</span> <span m=''2880000''>no.
  dy / dt, let''s give an example.</span> </p><p><span m=''2884000''>The equation
  I''m going to look at is something that looks like</span> <span m=''2890000''>this:
  y equals q of t, let''s say, okay,</span> <span m=''2893000''>a constant, but the
  constant a is positive.</span> </p><p><span m=''2897000''>So, the constant here
  is negative.</span> </p><p><span m=''2899000''>Then, when I solve, my k, in other
  words,</span> <span m=''2903000''>is now properly written as negative a.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2906000''>And therefore, this formula should now become</span>
  <span m=''2910000''>not this, but the negative k is a t.</span> </p><p><span m=''2916000''>And,
  here it''s negative a t. And, here it is positive a t.</span> </p><p><span m=''2921000''>Now,
  why is it, if this is going to be the</span> <span m=''2924000''>solution, why are
  all those things totally irrelevant?</span> </p><p><span m=''2929000''>This is not
  a transient any longer because if a is positive,</span> <span m=''2934000''>this
  goes to infinity. Or, if I go to minus infinity,</span> <span m=''2939000''>then
  C is negative. So, it''s not transient.</span> </p><p><span m=''2943000''>It''s
  not going to zero, and it depends heavily on the</span> <span m=''2947000''>initial
  conditions. That means that of these two</span> <span m=''2950000''>functions, this
  is the important guy.</span> </p><p><span m=''2952000''>This is just fixed, some
  fixed function.</span> </p><p><span m=''2955000''>Everything, in other words, is
  going to depend upon the</span> <span m=''2958000''>initial conditions, whereas
  in the other cases we</span> <span m=''2961000''>have been studying, the initial
  conditions after a</span> <span m=''2965000''>while don''t matter anymore. Now,
  why did I say I would</span> <span m=''2970000''>alienate half of you? Well, because
  in what subjects</span> <span m=''2975000''>will a be positive? In what subjects
  will k be</span> <span m=''2979000''>negative? k is typically negative in</span>
  <span m=''2983000''>biology, economics, Sloan.</span> </p><p><span m=''2985000''>In
  other words, the simple thing is think of it</span> <span m=''2990000''>in biology.
  What''s the simplest equation</span> <span m=''2993000''>for population growth?
  Well, it is dP / dt equals</span> <span m=''2998000''>some, if the population is
  growing, a times P,</span> <span m=''3002000''>and a is a positive number. That
  means P prime minus a P is</span> <span m=''3009000''>zero. So, the thing I want
  to leave</span> <span m=''3013000''>you with is this. If life is involved,</span>
  <span m=''3016000''>k is likely to be negative. k is positive when inanimate</span>
  <span m=''3022000''>things are involved; I won''t say dead,</span> <span m=''3025000''>inanimate.</span>
