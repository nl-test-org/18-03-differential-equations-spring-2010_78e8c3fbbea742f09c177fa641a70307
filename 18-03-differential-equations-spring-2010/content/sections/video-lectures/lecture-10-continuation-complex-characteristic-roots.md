transcript: '<p><span m=''26000''>This is a brief, so, the equation,</span> <span
  m=''29000''>and we got the characteristic equation from the last time.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''35000''>The general topic for today is going to be oscillations,</span> <span
  m=''41000''>which are extremely important in the applications and in</span> <span
  m=''47000''>everyday life. But, the oscillations,</span> <span m=''50000''>we know,
  are associated with a complex root.</span> </p><p><span m=''55000''>So, they correspond
  to complex roots of the characteristic</span> <span m=''61000''>equation. r squared
  plus br plus k equals</span> <span m=''66000''>zero. I''d like to begin.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''69000''>Most of the lecture will be about discussing the relations</span>
  <span m=''73000''>between these numbers, these constants,</span> <span m=''76000''>and
  the various properties that the solutions,</span> <span m=''79000''>oscillatory
  solutions, have.</span> </p><p><span m=''81000''>But, before that, I''d like to
  begin by clearing</span> <span m=''84000''>up a couple of questions almost everybody
  has at some point or</span> <span m=''89000''>other when they study the case of
  complex roots.</span> </p><p><span m=''94000''>Complex roots are the case which
  produce oscillations in</span> <span m=''98000''>the solutions. That''s the relation,</span>
  <span m=''100000''>and that''s why I''m talking about this for the first few</span>
  <span m=''104000''>minutes. Now, what is the problem?</span> </p><p><span m=''107000''>The
  complex roots, of course, there will be two</span> <span m=''110000''>roots, and
  they occur at the complex conjugates of each</span> <span m=''114000''>other. So,
  they will be of the form a</span> <span m=''117000''>plus or minus bi. Last time,
  I showed you,</span> <span m=''122000''>I took the root r equals a plus bi,</span>
  <span m=''128000''>which leads to the solution. The corresponding solution is a</span>
  <span m=''134000''>complex solution which is e to the at, (a plus i b)t.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''141000''>And, what we did was the</span> <span m=''144000''>problem
  was to get real solutions out of that.</span> </p><p><span m=''149000''>We needed
  two real solutions, and the way I got them was by</span> <span m=''156000''>separating
  this into its real part and its imaginary part.</span> </p><p><span m=''164000''>And,
  I proved a little theorem for you that said both of those</span> <span m=''167000''>give
  solutions. So, the real part was e to the</span> <span m=''169000''>a t times cosine
  b t, and the imaginary</span> <span m=''172000''>part was e to the at sine b t.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''175000''>And, those were the two solutions.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''177000''>So, here was y1. And, the point was those,</span> <span m=''179000''>out
  of the complex solutions, we got real solutions.</span> </p><p><span m=''183000''>We
  have to have real solutions because we live in the real</span> <span m=''187000''>world.
  The equation is real.</span> </p><p><span m=''189000''>Its coefficients are real.
  They represent real quantities.</span> </p><p><span m=''193000''>That''s the way
  the solutions, therefore, have to be.</span> </p><p><span m=''197000''>So, these,
  the point is, these are now real solutions,</span> <span m=''201000''>these two
  guys, y1 and y2.</span> </p><p><span m=''203000''>Now, the first question almost
  everybody has,</span> <span m=''206000''>and I was pleased to see at the end of
  the lecture,</span> <span m=''209000''>a few people came up and asked me, yeah,
  well,</span> <span m=''213000''>you took a plus bi, but there was another root,</span>
  <span m=''216000''>a minus bi. You didn''t use that one.</span> </p><p><span m=''220000''>That
  would give two more solutions, right?</span> </p><p><span m=''223000''>Of course,
  they didn''t say that.</span> </p><p><span m=''225000''>They were too smart. They
  just said,</span> <span m=''227000''>what about that other root? Well, what about
  it?</span> </p><p><span m=''230000''>The reason I don''t have to talk about the
  other root is because</span> <span m=''234000''>although it does give to solutions,
  it doesn''t give two</span> <span m=''238000''>new ones. Maybe I can indicate that
  most</span> <span m=''242000''>clearly here even though you won''t be able to take
  notes by</span> <span m=''247000''>just using colored chalk. Suppose, instead of
  plus bi,</span> <span m=''252000''>I used a minus bi.</span> </p><p><span m=''256000''>What
  would have changed? Well, this would now become</span> <span m=''260000''>minus
  here. Would this change?</span> </p><p><span m=''263000''>No, because e to the minus
  ibt is the cosine of</span> <span m=''268000''>minus b, but that''s the same as
  the cosine of b.</span> </p><p><span m=''274000''>How about here? This would become
  the sine of</span> <span m=''277000''>minus bt. But that''s simply the negative</span>
  <span m=''282000''>of the sine of bt. So, the only change would have</span> <span
  m=''287000''>been to put a minus sign there. Now, I don''t care if I get y2</span>
  <span m=''292000''>or negative y2 because what am I going to do with it?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''297000''>When I get it, I''m going to write y,</span> <span m=''300000''>the
  general solution, as c1 y1 plus c2 y2.</span> </p><p><span m=''305000''>So, if I
  get negative y2, that just changes that</span> <span m=''309000''>arbitrary constant
  from c2 to minus c2, which is just as</span> <span m=''313000''>arbitrary a constant.
  So, in other words,</span> <span m=''317000''>there''s no reason to use the other
  root because it doesn''t</span> <span m=''322000''>give anything new. Now, there
  the story could</span> <span m=''325000''>stop. And, I would like it to stop,</span>
  <span m=''328000''>frankly, but I don''t dare because there''s a second</span> <span
  m=''333000''>question. And, I''m visiting recitations</span> <span m=''337000''>not
  this semester, but in previous semesters.</span> </p><p><span m=''340000''>In 18.03,
  so many recitations do this.</span> </p><p><span m=''342000''>I have to partly inoculate
  you against it, and partly tell you</span> <span m=''346000''>that some of the engineering
  courses do do it,</span> <span m=''350000''>and therefore you probably should learn
  it also.</span> </p><p><span m=''353000''>So, there is another way of proceeding,
  which is what you</span> <span m=''357000''>might have thought. Hey, look, we got
  two complex</span> <span m=''360000''>roots. That gives us two solutions,</span>
  <span m=''364000''>which are different. Neither one is a constant</span> <span m=''368000''>multiple
  of the other. So, the other approach is,</span> <span m=''372000''>use, as a general
  solution, y equals, now,</span> <span m=''376000''>I''m going to put a capital C
  here.</span> </p><p><span m=''379000''>You will see why in just a second, times
  e to the (a plus b</span> <span m=''384000''>i) times t.</span> </p><p><span m=''387000''>And
  then, I will use the other solution: C2 times e to the (a</span> <span m=''392000''>minus
  b i) t.</span> </p><p><span m=''397000''>These are two independent solutions.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''399000''>And therefore, can''t I get the general</span> <span m=''402000''>solution
  in that form? Now, in a sense,</span> <span m=''405000''>you can. The whole problem
  is the</span> <span m=''407000''>following, of course, that I''m only interested
  in</span> <span m=''411000''>real solutions. This is a complex function.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''414000''>This is another complex function.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''416000''>It''s got an i in it, in other words,</span> <span m=''419000''>when
  I write it out as u plus iv.</span> </p><p><span m=''424000''>If I expect to be
  able to get a real solution out of that,</span> <span m=''428000''>that means I
  have to make, allow these coefficients to be</span> <span m=''433000''>complex numbers,
  and not real numbers.</span> </p><p><span m=''436000''>So, in other words, what
  I''m saying is that an</span> <span m=''440000''>expression like this, where the
  a plus bi and a minus</span> <span m=''444000''>bi are complex roots of that characteristic
  equation,</span> <span m=''448000''>is formally a very general, complex solution
  to the</span> <span m=''453000''>equation. And therefore,</span> <span m=''456000''>the
  problem becomes, how, from this expression,</span> <span m=''461000''>do I get the
  real solutions? So, the problem is,</span> <span m=''467000''>I accept these as
  the complex solutions.</span> </p><p><span m=''471000''>My problem is, to find among
  all these guys</span> <span m=''476000''>where C1 and C2 are allowed to be complex,
  the problem is,</span> <span m=''483000''>which of the green solutions are real?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''489000''>Now, there are many ways of getting the answer.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''492000''>There is a super hack way. The super hack way is to say,</span>
  <span m=''497000''>well, this one is C1 plus i d1.</span> </p><p><span m=''500000''>This
  is C2 plus i d2.</span> </p><p><span m=''503000''>And, I''ll write all this out
  in terms of what it is,</span> <span m=''507000''>you know, cosine plus i sine,
  and don''t forget the e to the</span> <span m=''511000''>at. And, I will write it
  all out,</span> <span m=''514000''>and it will take an entire board.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''516000''>And then, I will just see what the condition is.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''519000''>I''ll write its real part, and its imaginary part.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''522000''>And then, I will say the imaginary part has got to be</span> <span
  m=''526000''>zero. And, then I will see what it''s</span> <span m=''528000''>like.
  That works fine.</span> </p><p><span m=''529000''>It just takes too much space.
  And also, it doesn''t teach you</span> <span m=''533000''>a few things that I think
  you should know.</span> </p><p><span m=''536000''>So, I''m going to give another.
  So, let''s say we can answer</span> <span m=''539000''>this two ways: by hack, in
  other words,</span> <span m=''542000''>multiply everything out. Multiply all out,</span>
  <span m=''547000''>make the imaginary part equal zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''551000''>Now,
  here''s a better way, in my opinion.</span> </p><p><span m=''556000''>What I''m
  trying to do is, this is some complex function,</span> <span m=''563000''>u plus
  iv. How do I know when a complex</span> <span m=''567000''>function is real? I want
  this to be real.</span> </p><p><span m=''574000''>Well, the hack method corresponds
  to,</span> <span m=''578000''>say, v must be equal to zero. It''s real if v is zero.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''584000''>So, expand it out, and see why v is zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''589000''>There''s a slightly more subtle method, which is to change i to</span>
  <span m=''596000''>minus i. And, what?</span> </p><p><span m=''600000''>And, see
  if it stays the same because if I change i to minus i</span> <span m=''610000''>and
  it turns out, the expression doesn''t change,</span> <span m=''617000''>then it
  must have been real, if the expression doesn''t</span> <span m=''626000''>change
  when I change I to minus I.</span> </p><p><span m=''633000''>Well, sure. But you
  will see it works.</span> </p><p><span m=''636000''>Now, that''s what I''m going
  to apply to this.</span> </p><p><span m=''641000''>If I want this to be real, I
  phrase the question,</span> <span m=''646000''>I rephrase the question for the green
  solution as change,</span> <span m=''652000''>so I''m going to change i to minus
  i in the green thing,</span> <span m=''658000''>and that''s going to give me what
  conditions,</span> <span m=''663000''>and that will give conditions on the C''s.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''669000''>Well, let''s do it. In fact, it''s easier done than</span>
  <span m=''672000''>talked about. Let''s change,</span> <span m=''674000''>take the
  green solution, and change.</span> </p><p><span m=''676000''>Well, I better recopy
  it, C1.</span> </p><p><span m=''678000''>So, these are complex numbers. That''s
  why I wrote them as</span> <span m=''682000''>capital letters because little letters
  you tend to interpret as</span> <span m=''687000''>real numbers. So, C1 e to the
  (a plus b i)t,</span> <span m=''690000''>I''ll recopy it quickly, plus C2 e to the
  (a minus b i).</span> </p><p><span m=''698000''>Okay, we''re going to change i to
  negative i.</span> </p><p><span m=''701000''>Now, here''s a complex number. What
  happens to it when you</span> <span m=''706000''>change i to negative i? You change
  it into its-- Class?</span> </p><p><span m=''711000''>What do we change it to? Its
  complex conjugate.</span> </p><p><span m=''715000''>And, the notation for complex
  conjugate is you put a bar over</span> <span m=''720000''>it. So, in other words,</span>
  <span m=''723000''>when I do that, the C1 changes to C1 bar,</span> <span m=''727000''>complex
  conjugate, the complex conjugate of C1.</span> </p><p><span m=''731000''>What happens
  to this guy? This guy changes to e to the (a</span> <span m=''737000''>minus b i)
  t. This changes to the complex</span> <span m=''742000''>conjugate of C2 now, times
  e to the (a plus b i) t.</span> </p><p><span m=''747000''>Well, I want these two
  to be</span> <span m=''752000''>the same. I want the two expressions the</span>
  <span m=''756000''>same. Why do I want them the same?</span> </p><p><span m=''760000''>Because,
  if there''s no change, that will mean that it''s real.</span> </p><p><span m=''766000''>Now,
  when is that going to happen?</span> </p><p><span m=''769000''>That happens if,
  well, here is this,</span> <span m=''773000''>that. If C2 should be equal to C1</span>
  <span m=''776000''>bar, that''s only one condition. There''s another condition.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''782000''>C2 bar should equal C1. So, I get two conditions,</span>
  <span m=''786000''>but there''s really only one condition there because if this</span>
  <span m=''790000''>is true, that''s true too. I simply put bars over both</span>
  <span m=''794000''>things, and two bars cancel each other out.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''798000''>If you take the complex conjugate and do it again,</span> <span m=''801000''>you
  get back where you started. Change i to minus i,</span> <span m=''805000''>and then
  i to minus i again. Well, never mind.</span> </p><p><span m=''810000''>Anyway, these
  are the same. This equation doesn''t say</span> <span m=''816000''>anything that
  the first one didn''t say already.</span> </p><p><span m=''821000''>So, this one
  is redundant. And, our conclusion is that the</span> <span m=''828000''>real solutions
  to the equation are, in their entirety,</span> <span m=''835000''>I now don''t need
  both C2 and C1.</span> </p><p><span m=''840000''>One of them will do, and since
  I''m going to write it</span> <span m=''843000''>out as a complex number, I will
  write it out in terms of</span> <span m=''847000''>its coefficient. So, it''s C1.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''849000''>Let''s just simply write it. C plus i times d,</span>
  <span m=''854000''>that''s the coefficient. That''s what I called C1 before.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''858000''>And, that''s times e to the (a plus b i) t.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''862000''>There''s no reason why I put bi here and id there,</span> <span m=''865000''>in
  case you''re wondering, sheer caprice.</span> </p><p><span m=''870000''>And what''s
  the other term? Now, the other term is</span> <span m=''874000''>completely determined.
  Its coefficient must be C minus</span> <span m=''878000''>i d times e to the (a
  minus b i) t.</span> </p><p><span m=''883000''>In other words, this thing is perfectly</span>
  <span m=''886000''>general. Any complex number times that</span> <span m=''889000''>first
  root you use, exponentiated,</span> <span m=''892000''>and the second term can be
  described as the complex</span> <span m=''896000''>conjugate of the first. The coefficient
  is the complex</span> <span m=''903000''>conjugate, and this part is the complex
  conjugate of that.</span> </p><p><span m=''910000''>Now, it''s in this form, many
  engineers write the</span> <span m=''915000''>solution this way, and physicists,</span>
  <span m=''919000''>too, so, scientists and engineers we will include.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''925000''>Write the solution this way. Write the real solutions this</span> <span
  m=''932000''>way in that complex form. Well, why do they do something</span> <span
  m=''935000''>so perverse? You will have to ask them.</span> </p><p><span m=''938000''>But,
  in fact, when we studied Fourier series,</span> <span m=''941000''>we will probably
  have to do something, have to do that at</span> <span m=''945000''>one point. If
  you work a lot with complex</span> <span m=''948000''>numbers, it turns out to be,
  in some ways,</span> <span m=''951000''>a more convenient representation than the
  one I''ve</span> <span m=''955000''>given you in terms of sines and cosines.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''959000''>Well, from this, how would I get,</span> <span m=''961000''>suppose
  I insisted, well, if someone gave it to me</span> <span m=''965000''>in that form,
  I don''t see how I would convert</span> <span m=''968000''>it back into sines and
  cosines. And, I''d like to show you how</span> <span m=''973000''>to do that efficiently,
  too, because,</span> <span m=''976000''>again, it''s one of the fundamental techniques
  that I</span> <span m=''980000''>think you should know. And, I didn''t get a chance
  to</span> <span m=''984000''>say it when we studied complex numbers that first lecture.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''988000''>It''s in the notes, but it doesn''t prove anything</span>
  <span m=''992000''>since I don''t think it made you use it in an example.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''998000''>So, the problem is, now, by way of finishing this</span>
  <span m=''1003000''>up, too, to change this to the old form, I mean the form</span>
  <span m=''1010000''>involving sines and cosines. Now, again, there are two ways</span>
  <span m=''1016000''>of doing it. The hack way is you write it</span> <span m=''1021000''>all
  out. Well, e to the (a plus b i)t</span> <span m=''1023000''>turns into e to the
  a t times</span> <span m=''1028000''>cosine this plus i sine that. And, the other
  term does,</span> <span m=''1032000''>too. And then you''ve got stuff out</span>
  <span m=''1034000''>front. And, the thing stretches over</span> <span m=''1037000''>two
  boards. But you group all the terms</span> <span m=''1040000''>together. You finally
  get it.</span> </p><p><span m=''1042000''>By the way, when you do it, you''ll find
  that the imaginary</span> <span m=''1046000''>part disappears completely. It has
  to because that''s the</span> <span m=''1051000''>way we chose the coefficients.
  So, here''s the hack method.</span> </p><p><span m=''1057000''>Write it all out:
  blah, blah, blah,</span> <span m=''1060000''>blah, blah, blah, blah, and nicer.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1062000''>Nicer, and teach you something you''re supposed to know.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1067000''>Write it this way. First of all,</span> <span m=''1070000''>you
  notice that both terms have an e to the a t</span> <span m=''1075000''>factor. Let''s
  get rid of that right</span> <span m=''1078000''>away. I''m pulling it out front</span>
  <span m=''1082000''>because that''s automatically real, and therefore,</span> <span
  m=''1086000''>isn''t going to affect the rest of the answer at all.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1090000''>So, let''s pull out that, and what''s left?</span> </p><p><span m=''1094000''>Well,
  what''s left, you see, involves just the two</span> <span m=''1098000''>parameters,
  C and d, so I''m going to have a C term.</span> </p><p><span m=''1102000''>And,
  I''m going to have a d term.</span> </p><p><span m=''1105000''>What multiplies the
  arbitrary constant, C?</span> </p><p><span m=''1110000''>Answer: after I remove
  the e to the a t,</span> <span m=''1114000''>what multiplies it is, e to the b i
  t plus e to the --</span> <span m=''1119000''>e to the b i t. Let''s write it i
  b t.</span> </p><p><span m=''1123000''>And, the other term is plus e to the negative
  i b t.</span> </p><p><span m=''1128000''>See how I got that,</span> <span m=''1131000''>pulled
  it out? And, how about the d?</span> </p><p><span m=''1134000''>What goes with d?
  d goes with,</span> <span m=''1137000''>well, first of all, there''s an I in front
  that i</span> <span m=''1141000''>better not forget. And then, the rest of it is
  i.</span> </p><p><span m=''1147000''>So, it''s i d times, it''s e to the b i t,</span>
  <span m=''1151000''>e to the i b t minus, now, e to the minus i b t.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1156000''>So, that''s the way the solution</span> <span m=''1162000''>looks.
  It doesn''t look a lot better,</span> <span m=''1165000''>but now you must use the
  magic formulas, which,</span> <span m=''1170000''>I want you to know as well as
  you know Euler''s formula,</span> <span m=''1175000''>even better than you know
  Euler''s formula.</span> </p><p><span m=''1181000''>They''re a consequence of Euler''s
  formula.</span> </p><p><span m=''1183000''>They''re Euler''s formula read backwards.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1185000''>Euler''s formula says you''ve got a complex exponential
  here.</span> </p><p><span m=''1189000''>Here''s how to write it in terms of sines
  and cosines.</span> </p><p><span m=''1192000''>The backwards thing says you''ve
  got a sine or a cosine.</span> </p><p><span m=''1195000''>Here is the way to write
  it in terms of complex exponentials.</span> </p><p><span m=''1200000''>And, remember,
  the way to do it is,</span> <span m=''1204000''>cosine a is equal to e to the i
  a t, i a, plus e to the negative</span> <span m=''1211000''>i a divided by two.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1217000''>And, sine of a is almost the same thing, except you use
  a</span> <span m=''1224000''>minus sign. And, what everybody forgets,</span> <span
  m=''1228000''>you have to divide by i. So, this is a backwards version</span> <span
  m=''1235000''>of Euler''s formula. The two of them taken together</span> <span m=''1238000''>are
  equivalent to Euler''s formula.</span> </p><p><span m=''1240000''>If I took cosine
  a, multiply this through by i,</span> <span m=''1244000''>and added them up, on
  the right-hand side I''d get</span> <span m=''1247000''>exactly e to the ia. I''d
  get Euler''s formula,</span> <span m=''1251000''>in other words. All right, so,</span>
  <span m=''1253000''>what does this come out to be, finally?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1255000''>This particular sum of exponentials,</span> <span m=''1258000''>you
  should always recognize as real.</span> </p><p><span m=''1262000''>You know it''s
  real because when you change i to minus i,</span> <span m=''1267000''>the two terms
  switch. And therefore,</span> <span m=''1270000''>the expression doesn''t change.
  What is it?</span> </p><p><span m=''1274000''>This part is twice the cosine of bt.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1278000''>What''s this part? This part is 2 i times the sine</span>
  <span m=''1282000''>of bt. And so, what does the whole</span> <span m=''1287000''>thing
  come to be? It is e to the a t times 2C</span> <span m=''1293000''>cosine bt plus
  i times, did I lose possibly a,</span> <span m=''1298000''>no it''s okay, minus
  i times i is minus,</span> <span m=''1303000''>so, minus 2d times the sine of bt.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1310000''>Shall I write that out?</span> </p><p><span m=''1315000''>So,
  in other words, it''s e to the a t times 2C</span> <span m=''1318000''>cosine b
  t minus 2d times the sine of b t,</span> <span m=''1323000''>which is, since 2C
  and negative</span> <span m=''1327000''>2d are just arbitrary constants, just as
  arbitrary as the</span> <span m=''1332000''>constants of C and d themselves are.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1335000''>This is our old form of writing the real solution.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1339000''>Here''s the way using science and cosines, and there''s
  the way</span> <span m=''1344000''>that uses complex numbers and complex functions
  throughout.</span> </p><p><span m=''1350000''>Notice they both have two arbitrary
  constants in them,</span> <span m=''1353000''>C and d, two arbitrary constants.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1356000''>That, you expect. But that has two arbitrary</span> <span
  m=''1359000''>constants in it, too, just the real and</span> <span m=''1362000''>imaginary
  parts of that complex coefficient, C plus i d.</span> </p><p><span m=''1366000''>Well,
  that took half the</span> <span m=''1368000''>period, and it was a long, I don''t
  consider it a</span> <span m=''1372000''>digression because learning those ways
  of dealing with</span> <span m=''1376000''>complex numbers of complex functions
  is a fairly important</span> <span m=''1380000''>goal in this course, actually.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1384000''>But let''s get back now to studying what the oscillations</span>
  <span m=''1387000''>actually look like.</span> </p><p><span m=''1407000''>Okay,
  well, I''d like to save a little time, but very quickly,</span> <span m=''1414000''>you
  don''t have to reproduce this sketch.</span> </p><p><span m=''1419000''>I remember
  very well from Friday to Monday,</span> <span m=''1425000''>but I can''t expect
  you to for a variety of reasons.</span> </p><p><span m=''1431000''>I mean, I have
  to think about this stuff all weekend.</span> </p><p><span m=''1438000''>And you,
  God forbid. So, here''s the picture,</span> <span m=''1443000''>and I won''t explain
  anymore what''s in it,</span> <span m=''1446000''>except there''s the mass. Here
  is the spring constant,</span> <span m=''1449000''>the spring with its constant
  here.</span> </p><p><span m=''1451000''>Here''s the dashpot with its constant.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1453000''>The equation is from Newton''s law: m x double,</span>
  <span m=''1456000''>so this will be x, and here''s, let''s say,</span> <span m=''1459000''>the
  equilibrium point is over here.</span> </p><p><span m=''1461000''>It looks like
  m x double prime; we derived this last time,</span> <span m=''1465000''>plus c x
  prime plus k x equals zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''1470000''>And now, if I put
  that in standard form,</span> <span m=''1473000''>it''s going to look like x double
  prime plus c over m x</span> <span m=''1479000''>prime plus k over m times x equals
  zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''1485000''>And, finally,</span> <span m=''1487000''>the
  standard form in which your book writes it,</span> <span m=''1492000''>which is
  good, it''s a standard form in general</span> <span m=''1496000''>that is used in
  the science and engineering courses.</span> </p><p><span m=''1502000''>One writes
  this as, just to be perverse,</span> <span m=''1505000''>I''m going to change x
  back to y, okay, mostly just to be</span> <span m=''1511000''>eclectic, to get you
  used to every conceivable notation.</span> </p><p><span m=''1519000''>So, I''m going
  to write this to change x to y.</span> </p><p><span m=''1522000''>So, that''s going
  to become y double prime.</span> </p><p><span m=''1526000''>And now, this is given
  a new name, p, except to get rid of</span> <span m=''1530000''>lots of twos, which
  would really screw up the</span> <span m=''1533000''>formulas, make it 2p. You will
  see why in a minute.</span> </p><p><span m=''1538000''>So, there''s 2p times y prime,
  and this thing we</span> <span m=''1542000''>are going to call omega nought squared.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1546000''>Now, that''s okay. It''s a positive number.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1549000''>Any positive number is the square of some other positive</span> <span
  m=''1553000''>number. Take a square root.</span> </p><p><span m=''1555000''>You
  will see why, it makes the formulas much</span> <span m=''1559000''>pretty to call
  it that. And, it makes also a lot of</span> <span m=''1564000''>things much easier
  to remember. So, all I''m doing is changing</span> <span m=''1568000''>the names
  of the constants that way in order to get better</span> <span m=''1573000''>formulas,
  easier to remember formulas at the end.</span> </p><p><span m=''1576000''>Now, we
  are interested in the case where there is</span> <span m=''1580000''>oscillations.
  In other words,</span> <span m=''1582000''>I only care about the case in which this
  has complex roots,</span> <span m=''1587000''>because if it has just real roots,
  that''s the over-damped</span> <span m=''1591000''>case. I don''t get any oscillations.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1595000''>By far, oscillations are by far the more important of
  the cases,</span> <span m=''1600000''>I mean, just because, I don''t know,</span>
  <span m=''1603000''>I could go on for five minutes listing things that oscillate,</span>
  <span m=''1608000''>oscillations, you know, like this.</span> </p><p><span m=''1611000''>So
  they can oscillate by going to sleep, and waking up,</span> <span m=''1616000''>and
  going to sleep, and waking up.</span> </p><p><span m=''1619000''>They could oscillate.
  So, that means we''re going to</span> <span m=''1623000''>get complex roots. The
  characteristic equation is</span> <span m=''1627000''>going to be r squared plus
  2p. So, p is a constant,</span> <span m=''1630000''>now, right? Often, p I use in
  this position</span> <span m=''1633000''>to indicate a function of t. But here,
  p is a constant.</span> </p><p><span m=''1636000''>So, r squared plus 2p times r
  plus omega nought squared is</span> <span m=''1640000''>equal to zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1643000''>Now, what are its roots? Well, you see right away the</span> <span
  m=''1647000''>first advantage in putting in the two there.</span> </p><p><span m=''1651000''>When
  I use the quadratic formula, it''s negative 2p over</span> <span m=''1654000''>two.
  Remember that two in the</span> <span m=''1657000''>denominator. So, that''s simply
  negative p.</span> </p><p><span m=''1660000''>And, how about the rest? Plus or minus
  the square root</span> <span m=''1664000''>of, now do it in your head. 4p squared
  minus 4 omega nought</span> <span m=''1668000''>squared. So, there''s a four in
  both of</span> <span m=''1673000''>those terms. When I pull it outside becomes</span>
  <span m=''1676000''>two. And, the two in the denominator</span> <span m=''1679000''>is
  lurking, waiting to annihilate it.</span> </p><p><span m=''1683000''>So, that two
  disappears entirely, and it will we are</span> <span m=''1686000''>left with is,
  simply, p squared minus omega</span> <span m=''1689000''>nought squared.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1691000''>Now, whenever people write quadratic equations,</span>
  <span m=''1694000''>and arbitrarily put a two in there, it''s because they were</span>
  <span m=''1698000''>going to want to solve the quadratic equation using the</span>
  <span m=''1701000''>quadratic formula, and they don''t want all those</span> <span
  m=''1704000''>twos and fours to be cluttering up the formula.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1709000''>That''s what we are doing here. Okay, now, the first case is</span>
  <span m=''1713000''>where p is equal to zero. This is going to explain</span> <span
  m=''1717000''>immediately why I wrote that omega nought squared,</span> <span m=''1721000''>as
  you probably already know from physics.</span> </p><p><span m=''1724000''>If p is
  equal to zero, the mass isn''t zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''1728000''>Otherwise,
  nothing good would be happening here.</span> </p><p><span m=''1732000''>It must
  be that the damping is zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''1735000''>So, p is equal to
  zero corresponds to undamped.</span> </p><p><span m=''1740000''>There is no dashpot.
  The oscillations are undamped.</span> </p><p><span m=''1743000''>And, the equation,
  then, becomes the solutions,</span> <span m=''1746000''>then, are, well, the equation
  becomes the</span> <span m=''1749000''>equation of simple harmonic motion, which,</span>
  <span m=''1752000''>I think you already are used to writing in this form.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1755000''>And, the reason you''re writing in this form because
  you know</span> <span m=''1759000''>when you do that, this becomes the circular</span>
  <span m=''1762000''>frequency of the oscillations. The solutions are pure</span>
  <span m=''1766000''>oscillations, and omega nought is</span> <span m=''1769000''>the
  circular frequency. So, right away from the</span> <span m=''1773000''>equation
  itself, if you write it in this form,</span> <span m=''1777000''>you can read off
  what the frequency of the solutions is</span> <span m=''1781000''>going to be, the
  circular frequency of the solutions.</span> </p><p><span m=''1785000''>Now, the
  solutions themselves, of course, look like,</span> <span m=''1789000''>the general
  solutions look like y equal, in this particular</span> <span m=''1794000''>case,
  the p part is zero. This is zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''1797000''>It''s simply,
  so, in this case,</span> <span m=''1799000''>r is equal to omega nought i times
  omega naught plus or</span> <span m=''1803000''>minus, but as before we don''t bother
  with the minus sign since</span> <span m=''1808000''>one of those roots is good
  enough.</span> </p><p><span m=''1813000''>And then, the solutions are simply c1
  cosine omega nought t</span> <span m=''1816000''>plus c2 sine omega nought t.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1820000''>That''s if you write it out in</span> <span m=''1823000''>the
  sign, and if you write it using the trigonometric</span> <span m=''1826000''>identity,
  then the other way of writing it is a times the cosine</span> <span m=''1830000''>of
  omega nought t.</span> </p><p><span m=''1834000''>But now you will have to put it
  a phase lag.</span> </p><p><span m=''1837000''>So, you have those two forms of writing
  it.</span> </p><p><span m=''1841000''>And, I assume you remember writing the little
  triangle,</span> <span m=''1845000''>which converts one into the other.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1848000''>Okay, so this justifies calling this omega nought squared</span> <span
  m=''1853000''>rather than k over m.</span> </p><p><span m=''1856000''>And now, the
  question is what does the damp case look like?</span> </p><p><span m=''1861000''>It
  requires a somewhat closer analysis, and it requires a</span> <span m=''1866000''>certain
  amount of thinking. So, let''s begin with an epsilon</span> <span m=''1873000''>bit
  of thinking. So, here''s my question.</span> </p><p><span m=''1878000''>So, in the
  damped case, I want to be sure that I''m</span> <span m=''1884000''>getting oscillations.
  When do I get oscillations if,</span> <span m=''1890000''>well, we get oscillations
  if those roots are really complex,</span> <span m=''1897000''>and not masquerading.
  Now, when are the roots going</span> <span m=''1903000''>to be really complex? This
  has to be,</span> <span m=''1906000''>the inside has to be negative. p squared minus
  omega squared</span> <span m=''1912000''>must be negative.</span> </p><p><span m=''1916000''>p
  squared minus omega nought squared must be less than zero</span> <span m=''1921000''>so
  that we are taking a square root of negative number,</span> <span m=''1926000''>and
  we are getting a real complex roots,</span> <span m=''1929000''>really complex roots.
  In other words,</span> <span m=''1934000''>now, this says, remember these numbers
  are all</span> <span m=''1937000''>positive, p and omega nought are positive.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1941000''>So, the condition is that p should be</span> <span m=''1945000''>less
  than omega nought. In other words,</span> <span m=''1948000''>the damping should
  be less than the circular frequency,</span> <span m=''1952000''>except p is not
  the damping. It''s half the damping,</span> <span m=''1958000''>and it''s not really
  the damping either because it involved the</span> <span m=''1963000''>m, too. You''d
  better just call it p.</span> </p><p><span m=''1967000''>Naturally, I could write
  the condition out in terms of c,</span> <span m=''1972000''>m, and k. So, your book
  does that,</span> <span m=''1975000''>but I''m not going to. It gives it in terms
  of c,</span> <span m=''1979000''>m, and k, which somebody might want to know.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1983000''>But, you know, we don''t have to do everything</span>
  <span m=''1988000''>here. Okay, so let''s assume that this</span> <span m=''1992000''>is
  true. What is the solution look like?</span> </p><p><span m=''1995000''>Well, we
  already experimented with that last time.</span> </p><p><span m=''1999000''>Remember,
  there was some guiding thing which was an</span> <span m=''2003000''>exponential.
  And then, down here,</span> <span m=''2006000''>we wrote the negative. So, this
  was an exponential.</span> </p><p><span m=''2011000''>In fact, it was the exponential,
  e to the negative</span> <span m=''2015000''>pt. And, in between that,</span> <span
  m=''2018000''>the curve tried to do its thing.</span> </p><p><span m=''2021000''>So,
  the solution looks sort of like this.</span> </p><p><span m=''2025000''>It oscillated,
  but it had to use that</span> <span m=''2028000''>exponential function as its guidelines,
  as its amplitude,</span> <span m=''2033000''>in other words. Now, this is a truly
  terrible</span> <span m=''2037000''>picture. It''s so terrible,</span> <span m=''2041000''>it''s
  unusable. Okay, this picture never</span> <span m=''2045000''>happened. Unfortunately,</span>
  <span m=''2047000''>this is not my forte along with a lot of other things.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2052000''>All right, let''s try it better. Here''s our better picture.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2058000''>Okay, there''s the exponential. At this point,</span>
  <span m=''2062000''>I''m supposed to have a lecture demonstration.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2066000''>It''s supposed to go up on the thing, so you can all see it.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2074000''>But then, you wouldn''t be able to copy it.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2077000''>So, at least we are on even terms now.</span> </p><p><span m=''2080000''>Okay,
  how does the actual curve look?</span> </p><p><span m=''2083000''>Well, I''m just
  trying to be fair.</span> </p><p><span m=''2085000''>That''s all. Okay, after a
  while,</span> <span m=''2088000''>the point is, just so we have something to</span>
  <span m=''2091000''>aim at, let''s say, okay, here we are going to go,</span> <span
  m=''2095000''>we''re going to get down through there.</span> </p><p><span m=''2100000''>Okay
  then, this is our better curve.</span> </p><p><span m=''2103000''>Okay, so I am
  a solution, a particular solution</span> <span m=''2108000''>satisfying this initial
  condition.</span> </p><p><span m=''2112000''>I started here, and that was my initial</span>
  <span m=''2116000''>velocity. The slope of that thing gave me</span> <span m=''2120000''>the
  initial velocity. Now, the interesting question</span> <span m=''2126000''>is, the
  first, in some ways,</span> <span m=''2128000''>the most interesting question, though
  there will be others,</span> <span m=''2135000''>too, is what is this spacing? Well,
  that''s a period.</span> </p><p><span m=''2142000''>And now, it''s half a period.
  I clearly ought to think of</span> <span m=''2147000''>this as the whole period.
  So, let''s call that,</span> <span m=''2151000''>I''m going to call this pi over,
  so this spacing here,</span> <span m=''2156000''>from there to there, I will call
  that pi divided by</span> <span m=''2161000''>omega one because this, from here
  to here,</span> <span m=''2165000''>should be, I hope, twice that, two pi over omega</span>
  <span m=''2170000''>one. Now, my question is,</span> <span m=''2174000''>so this,
  for a solution, it''s, in fact,</span> <span m=''2178000''>is going to cross the
  axis regularly in that way.</span> </p><p><span m=''2184000''>My question is, how
  does this period,</span> <span m=''2188000''>so this is going to be its half period.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2194000''>I will put period in quotation marks because this isn''t
  really</span> <span m=''2199000''>a periodic function because it''s decreasing all
  the time in</span> <span m=''2203000''>amplitude. But, it''s trying to be</span>
  <span m=''2206000''>periodic. At lease it''s doing something</span> <span m=''2209000''>periodically.
  It''s crossing the axis</span> <span m=''2212000''>periodically. So, this is the
  half period.</span> </p><p><span m=''2215000''>Two pi over omega one would be its
  full</span> <span m=''2220000''>period. What I want to know is,</span> <span m=''2222000''>how
  does that half period, or how does-- omega one is</span> <span m=''2227000''>called
  its pseudo-frequency. This should really be called</span> <span m=''2233000''>its
  pseudo-period. Everything is pseudo.</span> </p><p><span m=''2236000''>Everything
  is fake here. Like, the amoeba has its fake</span> <span m=''2241000''>foot and
  stuff like that. Okay, so this is its</span> <span m=''2244000''>pseudo-period,
  pseudo-frequency,</span> <span m=''2247000''>pseudo-circular frequency, but that''s
  hopeless.</span> </p><p><span m=''2251000''>I guess it should be circular pseudo-frequency,</span>
  <span m=''2255000''>or I don''t know how you say that.</span> </p><p><span m=''2259000''>I
  don''t think pseudo is a word all by itself,</span> <span m=''2266000''>not even
  in 18.03, circular.</span> </p><p><span m=''2270000''>Okay, here''s my question.
  If the damping goes up,</span> <span m=''2278000''>this is the damping term. If
  the damping goes up,</span> <span m=''2286000''>what happens to the pseudo-frequency?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2291000''>The frequency is how often the curve, this is high-frequency,</span>
  <span m=''2299000''>and this is low-frequency, okay?</span> </p><p><span m=''2303000''>So,
  my question is, which way does the frequency</span> <span m=''2309000''>go? If the
  damping goes up,</span> <span m=''2313000''>does the frequency go up or down?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2318000''>Down. I mean, I''m just asking you to</span> <span m=''2322000''>answer
  intuitively on the basis of your intuition about how this</span> <span m=''2330000''>thing
  explains, how this thing goes,</span> <span m=''2335000''>and now let''s get the
  formula. What, in fact,</span> <span m=''2341000''>is omega one? What is omega one?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2345000''>The answer is when I solve the equation, so,</span> <span
  m=''2349000''>r is now, so in other words, if omega one is,</span> <span m=''2353000''>sorry,
  if I have p, if p is no longer zero as it</span> <span m=''2358000''>was in the
  undamped case, what is the root,</span> <span m=''2362000''>now? Okay, well, the
  root is minus p</span> <span m=''2365000''>plus or minus the square root of p squared,
  --</span> <span m=''2371000''>-- now I''m going to write it this way, minus,</span>
  <span m=''2374000''>to indicate that it''s really a negative number,</span> <span
  m=''2378000''>omega squared minus p squared.</span> </p><p><span m=''2382000''>Now,
  I''m going to call this, because you see when I change</span> <span m=''2387000''>this
  to sines and cosines, the square root of this number</span> <span m=''2392000''>is
  what''s going to become that new frequency.</span> </p><p><span m=''2395000''>I''m
  going to call that minus p plus or minus the square root of</span> <span m=''2400000''>minus
  omega one squared. That''s going to be the new</span> <span m=''2406000''>frequency.
  And therefore,</span> <span m=''2408000''>the root is going to change so that the
  corresponding solution</span> <span m=''2413000''>is going to look, how?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2415000''>Well, it''s going to be e to the negative pt times,</span>
  <span m=''2420000''>let''s write it out first in terms of sines and cosines,</span>
  <span m=''2425000''>times the cosine of, well, the square root of omega</span> <span
  m=''2429000''>one squared is omega one.</span> </p><p><span m=''2435000''>But, there''s
  an i out front because of the negative sign in</span> <span m=''2439000''>front
  of that. So, it''s going to be the cosine</span> <span m=''2442000''>of omega one
  t plus c2 times the sine of omega</span> <span m=''2447000''>one t. Or, if you prefer
  to write it</span> <span m=''2451000''>out in the other form, it''s e to the minus
  p t times</span> <span m=''2454000''>some amplitude, which depends on c1 and c2,</span>
  <span m=''2457000''>times the cosine of omega one t minus the phase lag.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2462000''>Now, when I do that,</span> <span m=''2467000''>you see
  omega one is this pseudo-frequency.</span> </p><p><span m=''2473000''>In other words,
  this number omega one is the</span> <span m=''2477000''>same one that I identified
  here. And, why is that?</span> </p><p><span m=''2483000''>Well, because, what are
  two successive times?</span> </p><p><span m=''2487000''>Suppose it crosses, suppose
  the solution crosses</span> <span m=''2493000''>the x-axis, sorry, y-- the t-axis.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2498000''>For the first time, at the point t1,</span> <span m=''2502000''>what''s
  the next time it crosses t2?</span> </p><p><span m=''2506000''>Let''s jump to the
  two times across it.</span> </p><p><span m=''2511000''>So, I want this to be a whole
  period, not a half period.</span> </p><p><span m=''2517000''>What''s t2? Well, I
  say that t2 is nothing</span> <span m=''2522000''>but 2 pi divided by omega one.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2527000''>And, you can see that because when I plug in,</span>
  <span m=''2530000''>if it''s zero, if I have a point where it''s</span> <span m=''2534000''>zero,
  so, omega one t minus phi,</span> <span m=''2538000''>when will it be zero for the
  first time?</span> </p><p><span m=''2542000''>Well, that will be when the cosine
  has to be zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''2546000''>So, it will be some multiple of,
  it will be,</span> <span m=''2550000''>say, pi over two. Then, the next time this</span>
  <span m=''2555000''>happens will be, if that happens at t1,</span> <span m=''2559000''>then
  the next time it happens will be at t1 plus 2 pi divided</span> <span m=''2565000''>by
  omega one.</span> </p><p><span m=''2569000''>That will also be pi over two plus
  how much?</span> </p><p><span m=''2574000''>Plus 2 pi, which is the next time the
  cosine gets around and</span> <span m=''2580000''>is doing its thing, becoming zero
  as it goes down,</span> <span m=''2585000''>not as it''s coming up again. In other
  words,</span> <span m=''2591000''>this is what you should add to the first time
  to get this</span> <span m=''2597000''>second time that the cosine becomes zero
  coming in the</span> <span m=''2603000''>direction from top to the bottom.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2606000''>So, this is, in fact, the frequency with</span> <span
  m=''2610000''>which it''s crossing the axis. Now, notice,</span> <span m=''2616000''>I''m
  running out of boards. What a disaster!</span> </p><p><span m=''2621000''>In that
  expression, take a look at it.</span> </p><p><span m=''2626000''>I want to know
  what depends on what.</span> </p><p><span m=''2630000''>So, p, in that, we got constants.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2634000''>We got p. We got phi.</span> </p><p><span m=''2637000''>We
  got A. What else we got?</span> </p><p><span m=''2640000''>Omega one. What do these
  things depend</span> <span m=''2647000''>upon? You''ve got to keep it firmly in</span>
  <span m=''2651000''>mind. This depends only on the ODE.</span> </p><p><span m=''2654000''>It''s
  basically the damping. It depends on c and m.</span> </p><p><span m=''2659000''>Essentially,
  it''s c over 2m</span> <span m=''2663000''>actually. How about phi?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2665000''>Well, phi, what else depends only on the ODE?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2670000''>Omega one depends only on the ODE.</span> </p><p><span m=''2676000''>What''s
  the formula for omega one?</span> </p><p><span m=''2678000''>Omega one squared.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2680000''>Where do we have it? Omega one squared,</span> <span
  m=''2683000''>I never wrote the formula for you.</span> </p><p><span m=''2686000''>So,
  we have omega nought squared minus p squared equals</span> <span m=''2690000''>omega
  one squared.</span> </p><p><span m=''2693000''>What''s the relation between them?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2696000''>That''s the Pythagorean theorem. If this is omega nought,</span>
  <span m=''2700000''>then this omega one, this is p.</span> </p><p><span m=''2704000''>They
  make a little, right triangle in other words.</span> </p><p><span m=''2709000''>The
  omega one depends on the spring.</span> </p><p><span m=''2713000''>So, it''s equal
  to, well, it''s equal to that thing.</span> </p><p><span m=''2719000''>So, it depends
  on the damping. It depends upon the damping,</span> <span m=''2725000''>and it depends
  on the spring constant.</span> </p><p><span m=''2730000''>How about the phi and
  the A? What do they depend on?</span> </p><p><span m=''2736000''>They depend upon
  the initial conditions.</span> </p><p><span m=''2742000''>So, the mass of constants,
  they have different functions.</span> </p><p><span m=''2747000''>What''s making
  this complicated is that our answer needs four</span> <span m=''2753000''>parameters
  to describe it. This tells you how fast it''s</span> <span m=''2759000''>coming
  down. This tells you the phase lag.</span> </p><p><span m=''2763000''>This amplitude
  modifies, it tells you whether the</span> <span m=''2768000''>exponential curve
  starts going, is like that or goes like this.</span> </p><p><span m=''2775000''>And,
  finally, the omega one is this</span> <span m=''2778000''>pseudo-frequency, which
  tells you how it''s</span> <span m=''2782000''>bobbing up and down.</span> </p>'
