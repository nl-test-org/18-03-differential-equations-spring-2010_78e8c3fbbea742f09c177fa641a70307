transcript: '<p><span m=''10000''>I''d like to talk. Thank you.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''15000''>One of the things I''d like to give a little insight into today</span>
  <span m=''28000''>is the mathematical basis for hearing.</span> </p><p><span m=''38000''>For
  example, if a musical tone,</span> <span m=''41000''>a pure musical tone would consist
  of a pure oscillation in</span> <span m=''49000''>terms of the vibration of the
  air.</span> </p><p><span m=''53000''>It would be a pure oscillation. So, [SINGS],</span>
  <span m=''59000''>and if you superimpose upon that, suppose you sing a triad,</span>
  <span m=''66000''>[SINGS], those are three tones. Each has its own period of</span>
  <span m=''74000''>oscillation, and then another one, which is the top one,</span>
  <span m=''79000''>which is even faster. The higher it is,</span> <span m=''82000''>the
  faster the thing. Anyway, what you hear,</span> <span m=''86000''>then, is the sum
  of those things.</span> </p><p><span m=''89000''>So, C plus E plus G, let''s say,
  what you hear is the</span> <span m=''94000''>wave form. It''s periodics,</span>
  <span m=''97000''>still, but it''s a mess. I don''t know,</span> <span m=''100000''>I
  can''t draw it. So, this is periodic,</span> <span m=''103000''>but a mess, some
  sort of mess. Now, of course,</span> <span m=''107000''>if you hear the three tones
  together, most people,</span> <span m=''112000''>if they are not tone deaf, anyway,
  can hear the three</span> <span m=''116000''>tones that make up that. So, in other
  words,</span> <span m=''121000''>if this is the function which is the sum of those
  three,</span> <span m=''125000''>some sort of messy function, f of t,</span> <span
  m=''129000''>you''re able to do Fourier analysis on it,</span> <span m=''132000''>and
  break it up. You''re able to take that f of</span> <span m=''135000''>t, and somehow
  mentally express it as the sum of three pure</span> <span m=''140000''>oscillations.
  That''s Fourier analysis.</span> </p><p><span m=''142000''>We''ve been doing it
  with an infinite series,</span> <span m=''146000''>but it''s okay. It''s still Fourier
  analysis if</span> <span m=''149000''>you do it with just three. So, in other words,</span>
  <span m=''154000''>the f of t is going to be the sum of,</span> <span m=''158000''>let''s
  say, sine, I don''t know,</span> <span m=''161000''>it''s going to be the sign of
  one frequency plus the sine of</span> <span m=''166000''>another frequency plus
  the sine of a third, maybe with</span> <span m=''171000''>coefficients here. So,
  somehow,</span> <span m=''173000''>since you were born, you have been able to take
  the</span> <span m=''178000''>f of t, and express it as the sum of</span> <span
  m=''182000''>the three signs. And, here, therefore,</span> <span m=''187000''>the
  three tones that make up the triad.</span> </p><p><span m=''191000''>Now, the question
  is, how did you do that Fourier</span> <span m=''195000''>analysis? In other words,</span>
  <span m=''198000''>does your brain have a little integrator in it,</span> <span
  m=''203000''>which calculates the coefficients of that series?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''208000''>Of course, the answer is no. It has to do something else.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''214000''>So, one of the things I''d like to aim at in this lecture is</span>
  <span m=''219000''>just briefly explaining what, in fact, actually happens to do</span>
  <span m=''224000''>that. Now, to do that,</span> <span m=''226000''>we''ll have
  to make some little detours, as always.</span> </p><p><span m=''230000''>So, first
  I''m going to, throughout the lecture,</span> <span m=''234000''>in fact, I gave
  you last time a couple of shortcuts for</span> <span m=''239000''>calculating Fourier
  series based on evenness and oddness,</span> <span m=''244000''>and also some expansion
  of the idea of Fourier series where we</span> <span m=''249000''>use the different,
  but things didn''t have to be</span> <span m=''253000''>periodic or period two pi,
  but it can have an arbitrary</span> <span m=''257000''>period, 2L, and we could
  still get a Fourier expansion for it.</span> </p><p><span m=''265000''>Let me, therefore,
  begin just as a problem,</span> <span m=''268000''>another type of shortcut exercise,
  to do a Fourier</span> <span m=''273000''>calculation, which we are going to be
  later in the period to</span> <span m=''278000''>explain the music problem. So,
  let''s suppose we''re</span> <span m=''283000''>starting with the function, f of
  t,</span> <span m=''288000''>which is a real square wave, and I''ll make its period</span>
  <span m=''295000''>different from the one, not two pi.</span> </p><p><span m=''300000''>So,
  suppose we had a function like this.</span> </p><p><span m=''302000''>So, this is
  one, and this is one.</span> </p><p><span m=''304000''>So, the height is one, and
  this point is one as well.</span> </p><p><span m=''308000''>And then, it''s periodic
  ever after that.</span> </p><p><span m=''310000''>I''ll tell you what, let''s do
  like the electrical</span> <span m=''313000''>engineers do and put these vertical
  lines there even though</span> <span m=''317000''>they don''t exist. Okay, so the
  height is one and</span> <span m=''320000''>it goes over. The half period is one.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''323000''>This really is a square wave. I mean, it''s really a square,</span>
  <span m=''327000''>not what they usually call a square wave.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''331000''>So, my question is, what''s its Fourier series?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''336000''>Well, it''s neither even nor odd.</span> </p><p><span m=''340000''>That''s
  a little dismaying. It sounds like we''re going to</span> <span m=''347000''>have
  to calculate an''s and bn''s. So, the shortcuts I gave you</span> <span m=''354000''>last
  time don''t seem to be applicable.</span> </p><p><span m=''360000''>Now, of course,
  nor is the period two pi,</span> <span m=''363000''>but that shouldn''t be too bad.
  In fact, you ought to look for</span> <span m=''367000''>an expansion in terms of
  things that look like sine of n,</span> <span m=''371000''>well, what should it
  be?</span> </p><p><span m=''374000''>Since L is equal to one, the half period is
  equal to</span> <span m=''378000''>one. Remember, the period is 2L,</span> <span
  m=''380000''>not L. It''s n pi over L,</span> <span m=''382000''>but if L is one,
  we should be looking for an</span> <span m=''386000''>expansion in terms of functions
  that look like this.</span> </p><p><span m=''390000''>Now, since we''ve already
  done the work for the official square</span> <span m=''394000''>way, which looks
  something like this, what you always try to do</span> <span m=''399000''>is reduce
  these things to problems that you''ve already</span> <span m=''403000''>solved.
  This is a legitimate one,</span> <span m=''408000''>since I solved it in lecture
  for you.</span> </p><p><span m=''412000''>So, we can consider it as something we
  know.</span> </p><p><span m=''416000''>So, I observed that since I am very lazy,
  that if I lower this</span> <span m=''422000''>function by one half, it will become
  an odd function.</span> </p><p><span m=''429000''>Now it''s an odd function. Okay,
  I just cut the work in</span> <span m=''437000''>half. So, let''s call this function,</span>
  <span m=''442000''>let''s call this, I don''t know,</span> <span m=''446000''>S
  of t. The green one is the one we</span> <span m=''452000''>wanted to start with.
  So, f of t is a green</span> <span m=''457000''>function. But, I can improve things
  even</span> <span m=''460000''>more because the function that we calculated in the
  lecture is</span> <span m=''466000''>a lot like this salmon function. That''s why
  I called it S.</span> </p><p><span m=''471000''>But, the difference is that the
  function we calculated with this</span> <span m=''476000''>one. In the first place,</span>
  <span m=''478000''>it went down further. It went not to negative one</span> <span
  m=''484000''>half, which is where that one goes.</span> </p><p><span m=''488000''>But,
  it went down to negative one, and then went up here to</span> <span m=''495000''>plus
  one. And, it went over to pi.</span> </p><p><span m=''498000''>So, it came down
  again, but not, but at the point,</span> <span m=''503000''>pi. And here, negative
  pi went up</span> <span m=''507000''>again. Okay, let me remind you what</span>
  <span m=''511000''>this one was. Suppose we call it,</span> <span m=''514000''>O
  doesn''t look good, I don''t know,</span> <span m=''518000''>how about g of u? Let''s,
  for a secret reason,</span> <span m=''524000''>call the variable u this time, okay?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''527000''>So, the previous knowledge that I''m relying on was that
  I</span> <span m=''530000''>derived the Fourier series for you by an orthodox calculation.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''534000''>And, it''s not too hard to do because this is an odd function.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''538000''>And therefore, you only have to calculate the</span> <span
  m=''541000''>bn''s. And, half of them turn out to</span> <span m=''545000''>be zero,
  although you don''t know that in advance.</span> </p><p><span m=''549000''>But anyway,
  the answer was four over pi times the sum</span> <span m=''554000''>of just the
  odd ones, the sine of n u,</span> <span m=''557000''>and that you had to divide
  by n.</span> </p><p><span m=''561000''>So, this is the expansion of g, this function,</span>
  <span m=''565000''>g of u, the Fourier expansion of this function.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''570000''>Since it''s an odd function, it only involves the signs.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''574000''>There''s no funny stuff here because the period is now two</span> <span
  m=''579000''>pi. And, this came from the first</span> <span m=''581000''>lecture
  on Fourier series, or from the book,</span> <span m=''585000''>wherever you want
  it, or solutions to the notes.</span> </p><p><span m=''589000''>There are lots of
  sources for that.</span> </p><p><span m=''591000''>The solution''s in the notes.
  Okay, now, that looks so much</span> <span m=''596000''>like the salmon function,
  ---</span> <span m=''600000''>-- I ought to be able to convert one into the other.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''604000''>Now, I will do that by shrinking the axis.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''607000''>But, since this can get rather confusing, what I''ll do is</span> <span
  m=''611000''>overlay this. What I prefer to do is I think</span> <span m=''615000''>u,
  okay, I''m changing, I''m keeping the thing the same.</span> </p><p><span m=''619000''>But,
  I''m going to change the name of the variable,</span> <span m=''623000''>the t,
  in such a way that on the t-axis, this becomes the</span> <span m=''627000''>point,
  one. If I do that,</span> <span m=''630000''>then this function will turn exactly
  into that one,</span> <span m=''634000''>except it will go not from minus a half
  to a half,</span> <span m=''637000''>but it will go from negative one to one, since
  I haven''t done</span> <span m=''641000''>anything to the vertical axis. So, how
  I do that?</span> </p><p><span m=''645000''>What''s the relation between u and t?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''647000''>Well, u is equal to pi times t, or the other way around.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''651000''>You know that it''s going to be approximately this.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''654000''>Try one, and then check that it works.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''657000''>When t is equal to one, u is pi, which is what it''s</span> <span m=''660000''>supposed
  to be. So, this is the relation</span> <span m=''664000''>between the two. And therefore,</span>
  <span m=''666000''>without further ado, I can say that,</span> <span m=''669000''>let''s
  write the relation between them.</span> </p><p><span m=''671000''>f of t is what
  I want. Well, what''s f of t if I</span> <span m=''675000''>subtract one half of
  that? So, that''s going to be equal to</span> <span m=''679000''>the salmon function
  plus one half, right, or the salmon</span> <span m=''683000''>function is f of t
  lowered by one half.</span> </p><p><span m=''686000''>One thing is the same as the
  other.</span> </p><p><span m=''690000''>And, what''s the relation between this salmon
  function and</span> <span m=''695000''>the orange function? Well, the salmon function
  is,</span> <span m=''700000''>so, let''s convert, so, S of t -- it''s more</span>
  <span m=''705000''>convenient, as I wrote the formula g of u.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''709000''>Let''s start it from that end. If I start from g of u,</span> <span
  m=''714000''>what do I have to do to convert it into S of-- into the salmon</span>
  <span m=''720000''>function? Well, take one half of it.</span> </p><p><span m=''725000''>So,
  if I put them all together, the conclusion is that f of t</span> <span m=''732000''>is
  equal to one half plus S of t,</span> <span m=''738000''>which is one half of g
  of u,</span> <span m=''742000''>but u is pi t. So, it''s four pi,</span> <span m=''745000''>four
  over pi times the sum of the sine of n.</span> </p><p><span m=''751000''>And, for
  u, I will write pi t</span> <span m=''756000''>divided by n. And, sorry, I forgot
  to say</span> <span m=''760000''>that sum is only over the odd values of n, not
  all values of</span> <span m=''764000''>n. So, the sum over n odd of that,</span>
  <span m=''767000''>and, of course, the two will cancel that.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''770000''>So, here we have, in other words,</span> <span m=''773000''>just by
  this business of shrinking or just stretching or</span> <span m=''777000''>shrinking
  the axis, lowering it and squishing it</span> <span m=''781000''>that way a little
  bit. We get from this Fourier</span> <span m=''786000''>series, we get that one
  just by this geometric procedure.</span> </p><p><span m=''791000''>I''d like you
  to be able to do that because it saves a lot of</span> <span m=''796000''>time.
  Okay, so let''s put this answer</span> <span m=''799000''>up in, I''m going to need
  it in a minute, but I don''t really want</span> <span m=''805000''>to recopy it.
  So, let me handle it by</span> <span m=''808000''>erasing. So, let''s call that
  plus two</span> <span m=''812000''>over pi, and there is our formula for</span>
  <span m=''816000''>that green function that we wrote before.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''819000''>So, I''ll put that in green. So, we''ll have a color-coded</span> <span
  m=''823000''>lecture again. Now, what we''re going to be</span> <span m=''826000''>doing
  ultimately, to getting at the music problem</span> <span m=''830000''>that I posed
  at the beginning of the lecture, is we want to</span> <span m=''835000''>solve,
  and this is what a study of Fourier series has been</span> <span m=''839000''>aiming
  at, to solve second-order linear equations with constant</span> <span m=''844000''>coefficients
  were the right-hand side was a more general function</span> <span m=''849000''>than
  the kind we''ve been handling.</span> </p><p><span m=''854000''>So, now, in order
  to simplify, and we don''t have a lot of time</span> <span m=''857000''>in the course,
  I''d have to take another day to</span> <span m=''860000''>make more complicated
  calculations,</span> <span m=''863000''>which I don''t want to do since you will
  learn a lot from them,</span> <span m=''867000''>anyway. I think you will find you''ve</span>
  <span m=''869000''>had enough calculation by the time Friday morning rolls</span>
  <span m=''872000''>around. So, let''s look at the undamped</span> <span m=''876000''>case,
  which is simpler, or undamped spring,</span> <span m=''879000''>or undamped anything
  because it doesn''t have that extra term,</span> <span m=''884000''>which requires
  extra calculations.</span> </p><p><span m=''886000''>So, I''ll follow the book now
  and some of the notes and the</span> <span m=''891000''>visuals, and called the
  independent variable-- the</span> <span m=''894000''>dependent variable I''m going
  to call x now.</span> </p><p><span m=''898000''>And, the independent variable is,
  as usual,</span> <span m=''901000''>time. So, this is going to be,</span> <span
  m=''904000''>in general, f of t, and I''m going to use it by</span> <span m=''908000''>calculating
  example, this is the actual f of t I''m</span> <span m=''912000''>going to be using.
  But, the general problem for a</span> <span m=''916000''>general f of t is to solve
  this, or at least to find a</span> <span m=''920000''>particular solution. That''s
  what most of the work</span> <span m=''923000''>is, because we already know how
  from that to get the general</span> <span m=''928000''>solution by adding the solution
  to the reduced equation,</span> <span m=''932000''>the associated homogeneous equation.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''936000''>So, all our work has been, this past couple of weeks,</span>
  <span m=''940000''>in how you find a particular solution.</span> </p><p><span m=''944000''>Now,
  the case in which we know what to do is,</span> <span m=''948000''>so we can find
  our particular solution.</span> </p><p><span m=''952000''>Let''s call that x sub
  p.</span> </p><p><span m=''955000''>We could find x sub p if the right hand side
  is cosine omega,</span> <span m=''961000''>well, in general, an exponential,</span>
  <span m=''964000''>but since we are not going to use complex exponentials today,</span>
  <span m=''969000''>all these things are real. And I''d like to keep them real.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''976000''>If it''s either cosine omega t or sine omega t,</span>
  <span m=''980000''>or some multiple of that by</span> <span m=''982000''>linearity,
  it''s just as good. We already know how to find the</span> <span m=''986000''>thing,
  and to find a particular solution.</span> </p><p><span m=''990000''>So, the procedure
  is use complex exponentials,</span> <span m=''993000''>and that magic formula I
  gave you.</span> </p><p><span m=''996000''>But, right now, just to save a little
  time,</span> <span m=''999000''>since I already did that on the lecture on resonance,</span>
  <span m=''1003000''>I solved it explicitly for that, and you''ve had adequate</span>
  <span m=''1008000''>practice I think in the problem sets.</span> </p><p><span m=''1010000''>Let''s
  simply write down the answer that comes out of that.</span> </p><p><span m=''1015000''>The
  answer for the particular solution is cosine omega t</span> <span m=''1019000''>or
  sine omega t.</span> </p><p><span m=''1025000''>That''s the top. And, it''s over
  a constant.</span> </p><p><span m=''1028000''>And, the constant is omega naught
  squared.</span> </p><p><span m=''1033000''>That''s the natural frequency which comes
  from the system,</span> <span m=''1039000''>minus the imposed frequency, the driving
  frequency that the</span> <span m=''1044000''>system, the spring or whatever it
  is, undamped spring,</span> <span m=''1049000''>is being driven with. Okay, understand
  the notation.</span> </p><p><span m=''1054000''>Cosine this over that, or sine,
  depending on whether</span> <span m=''1059000''>you started driving it with cosine
  or sine.</span> </p><p><span m=''1063000''>So, this is from the lecture, if you
  like,</span> <span m=''1066000''>from the lecture on resonance, but again it''s,</span>
  <span m=''1070000''>I hope by now, a familiar fact.</span> </p><p><span m=''1073000''>Let
  me remind you what this had to do with resonance.</span> </p><p><span m=''1078000''>Then,
  the observation was that if omega, the driving frequency</span> <span m=''1083000''>is
  very close to the natural frequency, then this is close to</span> <span m=''1089000''>that.
  The denominator is almost zero,</span> <span m=''1093000''>and that makes the amplitude
  of the response very,</span> <span m=''1097000''>very large. And, that was the phenomenon
  of</span> <span m=''1100000''>resonance. Okay, now what I''d like to do</span> <span
  m=''1103000''>is apply those formulas to finding out what happens for a</span> <span
  m=''1108000''>general f(t), or in particular this one.</span> </p><p><span m=''1112000''>So,
  in general, I''ll keep using the notation,</span> <span m=''1116000''>f of t, even
  though I''ve sorted used it</span> <span m=''1121000''>for that. But in general,</span>
  <span m=''1124000''>what''s the situation? If f of t is a sine series,</span> <span
  m=''1129000''>cosine series, all right, let''s do everything.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1133000''>Suppose it''s, in other words,</span> <span m=''1136000''>the procedure
  is, take your f of t,</span> <span m=''1140000''>expand it in a Fourier series.
  Well, doesn''t that assume it''s</span> <span m=''1147000''>periodic? Yes, sort
  of.</span> </p><p><span m=''1149000''>So, suppose it''s a Fourier series.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1152000''>I''ll make a very general Fourier series,</span> <span
  m=''1155000''>write it this way: cosine (omega)n t,</span> <span m=''1158000''>and
  then the sine terms,</span> <span m=''1162000''>sine (omega)n t from one to infinity
  where</span> <span m=''1167000''>the omegas are, omega n is short for that.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1172000''>Well, it''s going to have the n in it, of course,</span>
  <span m=''1175000''>but I want, now, to make the general period to</span> <span
  m=''1179000''>be 2L. So, it would be n pi over L.</span> </p><p><span m=''1182000''>Of
  course, if L is equal to</span> <span m=''1185000''>one, then it''s n pi. Or, if
  L equals pi,</span> <span m=''1188000''>those are the two most popular cases, by
  far.</span> </p><p><span m=''1192000''>Then, it''s simply n itself, the driving
  frequency.</span> </p><p><span m=''1196000''>But, this would be the general case,
  n pi over L</span> <span m=''1201000''>if the period is the period of f of t is
  2L.</span> </p><p><span m=''1207000''>So, that''s what the Fourier series looks
  like.</span> </p><p><span m=''1210000''>Okay, then the particular solution will
  be what?</span> </p><p><span m=''1214000''>Well, I got these formulas. In other
  words,</span> <span m=''1218000''>what I''m using is superposition principle.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1221000''>If it''s just this, then I know what the answer is</span>
  <span m=''1225000''>for the particular solution, the response.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1230000''>So, if you make a sum of these things, a sum of these inputs,</span>
  <span m=''1234000''>you are going to get a sum of the responses by superposition.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1239000''>So, let''s write out the ones we are absolutely certain
  of.</span> </p><p><span m=''1243000''>What''s the response to here? Well, it''s
  (a)n cosine omega n</span> <span m=''1247000''>t. The only thing is,</span> <span
  m=''1251000''>now it''s divided by omega naught squared.</span> </p><p><span m=''1255000''>This
  constant has changed, and the same thing here.</span> </p><p><span m=''1260000''>Of
  course, by linearity, if this is multiplied by a,</span> <span m=''1263000''>then
  the answer is multiplied by, the response is also</span> <span m=''1266000''>multiplied
  by a. So, the same thing happens</span> <span m=''1269000''>here. Here, it''s (b)n
  and over,</span> <span m=''1271000''>again, omega naught squared minus omega times
  the sine of</span> <span m=''1274000''>omega t.</span> </p><p><span m=''1277000''>So,
  in other words, as soon as you have the Fourier</span> <span m=''1280000''>expansion,
  the Fourier series for the input,</span> <span m=''1283000''>you automatically get
  this by just writing it down the Fourier</span> <span m=''1287000''>series for the
  response. That''s the fundamental idea of</span> <span m=''1292000''>Fourier series,
  at least applied in this</span> <span m=''1295000''>context. They have many other
  contexts,</span> <span m=''1298000''>approximations, so on and so forth.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1301000''>But, that''s the idea here. All right, what about that</span>
  <span m=''1305000''>constant term? Well, this formula still works</span> <span m=''1309000''>if
  omega equals zero. If omega equals zero,</span> <span m=''1312000''>then this is
  the constant, one.</span> </p><p><span m=''1314000''>The formula is still correct.
  Omega is zero here.</span> </p><p><span m=''1320000''>The only thing you have to
  remember is that the original</span> <span m=''1323000''>thing is written in this
  form. So, the response will be,</span> <span m=''1327000''>what will it be? Well,
  it''s one divided by omega</span> <span m=''1330000''>naught squared, if I''m in
  the case omega zero</span> <span m=''1332000''>is equal to zero. So, it''s a zero
  divided by two</span> <span m=''1336000''>omega naught squared. And, as you will
  see,</span> <span m=''1339000''>it looks just like the others. You''re just taking
  omega,</span> <span m=''1343000''>and making it equal to zero for that particular
  case.</span> </p><p><span m=''1346000''>Sorry, this should be omega n''s all the
  way through here.</span> </p><p><span m=''1360000''>All right, well, let''s apply
  this to the green</span> <span m=''1365000''>function. So, what have we got?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1369000''>We have its Fourier series. So, if the green function
  is,</span> <span m=''1376000''>if the input in other words is this square wave,</span>
  <span m=''1382000''>the green square wave, so in your notes,</span> <span m=''1386000''>this
  guy, this particular f of t is the input.</span> </p><p><span m=''1395000''>And,
  the equation is x double prime plus omega naught squared</span> <span m=''1400000''>x
  equals f of t.</span> </p><p><span m=''1403000''>Then, the response is, well, I
  can''t draw you a</span> <span m=''1407000''>picture of the response because I don''t
  know what the Fourier</span> <span m=''1412000''>series actually looks like. But,
  let''s at least write down</span> <span m=''1417000''>what the Fourier series is.
  The Fourier series will be,</span> <span m=''1423000''>well, what is it? It''s one
  half.</span> </p><p><span m=''1425000''>The constant out front is one half, except
  it''s one over two</span> <span m=''1430000''>omega naught squared.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1433000''>So, this is my function, f of t.</span> </p><p><span m=''1436000''>That''s
  the general formula for how the input is related to the</span> <span m=''1441000''>response.
  And, I''m applying it to this</span> <span m=''1446000''>particular function, f
  of t.</span> </p><p><span m=''1450000''>And, the answer is plus. Well, my Fourier
  series</span> <span m=''1455000''>involves only odd sums, only the summation over
  odd,</span> <span m=''1461000''>and only of the sign. So, it is going to be two
  over</span> <span m=''1466000''>pi, sorry, so it''s going to be two</span> <span
  m=''1471000''>over pi out front. That constant will carry along</span> <span m=''1477000''>by
  linearity. And, I''m going to sum over odd,</span> <span m=''1479000''>n odd values
  only. The basic thing in the upstairs</span> <span m=''1483000''>is going to be
  the sine of omega n t.</span> </p><p><span m=''1487000''>But, what is (omega)n?
  Well, (omega)n is n pi.</span> </p><p><span m=''1490000''>So, it''s n pi t. And,
  how about the bottom?</span> </p><p><span m=''1493000''>The bottom is going to be
  omega naught squared minus omega n</span> <span m=''1497000''>squared.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1501000''>And, this is my (omega)n, minus n pi squared.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1505000''>What''s that?</span> </p><p><span m=''1507000''>Well, I don''t know.
  All I could do would be to</span> <span m=''1512000''>calculate it. You could put
  it on MATLAB and</span> <span m=''1516000''>ask MATLAB to calculate and plot for
  you the first few terms,</span> <span m=''1522000''>and get some vague idea of what
  it looks like.</span> </p><p><span m=''1526000''>That''s nice, but it''s not what''s
  interesting</span> <span m=''1531000''>to do. What''s interesting to do is to</span>
  <span m=''1535000''>look at the size of the coefficients.</span> </p><p><span m=''1538000''>And,
  again, rather than do it in the abstract,</span> <span m=''1542000''>let''s take
  a specific value. Let''s suppose that the natural</span> <span m=''1546000''>frequency
  of the system, in other words,</span> <span m=''1550000''>the frequency at which
  that little spring wants to go</span> <span m=''1554000''>vibrate back and forth,
  whatever you got vibrating.</span> </p><p><span m=''1558000''>Let''s suppose the
  natural frequency that''s omega naught is</span> <span m=''1563000''>ten for the
  sake of definiteness,</span> <span m=''1565000''>as they say. Okay, if that''s ten,</span>
  <span m=''1569000''>all I want to do is calculate in the crudest possible way what</span>
  <span m=''1575000''>a few of these terms are. So, the response is,</span> <span
  m=''1579000''>so let''s see, we''ve got to give that a name.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1583000''>The response is (x)p of t.</span> </p><p><span m=''1586000''>What''s
  (x)p of t? I''m just going to calculate it</span> <span m=''1591000''>very approximately.
  This means, you know,</span> <span m=''1595000''>throwing caution to the winds because
  I don''t have a</span> <span m=''1599000''>calculator with me. And, I want you to
  look at this</span> <span m=''1603000''>thing without a calculator. The first term
  is one over 200.</span> </p><p><span m=''1607000''>Okay, that''s the only term I</span>
  <span m=''1610000''>can get exactly right. [LAUGHTER] Or,</span> <span m=''1612000''>I
  could if I could calculate. I suppose it''s 0.005,</span> <span m=''1616000''>right?
  That''s the constant term.</span> </p><p><span m=''1620000''>Okay, so the next term,
  let''s see, two over pi is two</span> <span m=''1624000''>thirds. I''ll keep that
  in mind,</span> <span m=''1627000''>right? Plus two thirds,</span> <span m=''1629000''>0.6,
  let''s say, that''s an indication of the</span> <span m=''1633000''>accuracy with
  which these things are going to be performed.</span> </p><p><span m=''1639000''>I
  think in Texas for a long while, the legislature declared</span> <span m=''1644000''>pi
  to be three, anyways.</span> </p><p><span m=''1647000''>One of those states did
  it to save calculation time.</span> </p><p><span m=''1651000''>I''m not kidding,
  by the way.</span> </p><p><span m=''1656000''>All right, so what''s the first term?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1658000''>If n equals one, I have the sine of pi t.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1662000''>That''s the n equals one term.</span> </p><p><span m=''1666000''>What''s
  the denominator like? That''s about 100 minus 9</span> <span m=''1670000''>squared.
  Let''s say it''s 91,</span> <span m=''1673000''>sine t over 91. What''s the next
  term?</span> </p><p><span m=''1676000''>Sine of three pi t, remember,</span> <span
  m=''1680000''>I am omitting, I''m only using the odd values</span> <span m=''1684000''>of
  n because those are the only ones that enter into the Fourier</span> <span m=''1689000''>expansion
  for this function, which is at the bottom of</span> <span m=''1694000''>everything.
  All right, what''s the sine</span> <span m=''1699000''>three pi t? Well, now, I''ve
  got 100 minus</span> <span m=''1706000''>three pi, -- -- that''s 9 squared is 81.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1712000''>So, no, what am I doing? So, we have 100 minus three</span>
  <span m=''1722000''>times pi is 9, squared.</span> </p><p><span m=''1726000''>Well,
  let''s say a little more. Let''s say 85.</span> </p><p><span m=''1733000''>So, that''s
  15. How bout the next one?</span> </p><p><span m=''1742000''>Well, it''s sine 5
  pi t.</span> </p><p><span m=''1745000''>I think I''ll stop here as soon as we do
  this one because at</span> <span m=''1749000''>this point it''s clear what''s happening.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1752000''>This is 100 squared minus, that''s 15 squared is 225,</span>
  <span m=''1756000''>so that''s about 125 with a negative sign.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1759000''>So, minus this divided by 125. And, after this they are going</span>
  <span m=''1764000''>to get really quite small because the next one will be</span>
  <span m=''1768000''>seven pi squared. That''s 400, and this is</span> <span m=''1773000''>becoming
  negligible. So, what''s happening?</span> </p><p><span m=''1778000''>So, it''s approximately,
  in other words,</span> <span m=''1782000''>0.005 plus the next coefficient is, let''s
  see,</span> <span m=''1788000''>6/10, let''s say 100, sine pi t.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1791000''>And, what comes next? Well, it''s now 1/20th.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1796000''>It''s about a 20th. Let''s call that 0.005 sine</span> <span m=''1803000''>three
  pi t, and now so small,</span> <span m=''1808000''>minus 0.01, let''s say times
  this last one,</span> <span m=''1813000''>sine 5 pi t. What you find,</span> <span
  m=''1816000''>in other words, is that the frequencies which</span> <span m=''1822000''>make
  up the response do not occur with the same amplitude.</span> </p><p><span m=''1830000''>What
  happens is that this amplitude is roughly five times</span> <span m=''1835000''>larger
  than any of the neighboring ones.</span> </p><p><span m=''1838000''>And after that,
  it''s a lot larger than the ones</span> <span m=''1843000''>that come later. In
  other words,</span> <span m=''1846000''>the main frequency which occurs in the response
  is the frequency</span> <span m=''1852000''>three pi. What''s happened is,</span>
  <span m=''1854000''>in other words, near resonance has occurred.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1860000''>So, if omega is ten, very near resonance,</span> <span m=''1864000''>that
  is, it''s not too close, but it''s not too far away</span> <span m=''1870000''>either,
  occurs for the frequency three pi in the input.</span> </p><p><span m=''1876000''>Now,
  where''s the frequency three pi in the input?</span> </p><p><span m=''1882000''>It
  isn''t there. It''s just that green thing.</span> </p><p><span m=''1887000''>Where
  in that is the frequency three pi?</span> </p><p><span m=''1893000''>I can''t answer
  that for you, but that''s the function of</span> <span m=''1897000''>Fourier series,
  to say that you can decompose</span> <span m=''1901000''>that green function into
  a sum of frequencies,</span> <span m=''1905000''>as it were, and the Fourier coefficients
  tell you how much</span> <span m=''1910000''>frequency goes into each of those f
  of t''s.</span> </p><p><span m=''1914000''>Now, so, f of t is decomposed into the
  sum of frequencies by</span> <span m=''1919000''>the Fourier analysis. But, the
  system isn''t going to</span> <span m=''1924000''>respond equally to all those frequencies.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1927000''>It''s going to pick out and favor the one which is closest</span>
  <span m=''1932000''>to its natural frequency. So, what''s happened,</span> <span
  m=''1935000''>these frequencies, the frequencies and their</span> <span m=''1939000''>relative
  importance in f of t are hidden,</span> <span m=''1943000''>as it were. They''re
  hidden because we can''t</span> <span m=''1946000''>see them unless you do the Fourier
  analysis,</span> <span m=''1950000''>and look at the size of the coefficients.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1955000''>But, the system can pick out. The system picks out and</span>
  <span m=''1964000''>favors, picks out for resonance, or resonates with,</span> <span
  m=''1974000''>resonates with the frequencies closest to its natural</span> <span
  m=''1984000''>frequency. Well, suppose the system had</span> <span m=''1989000''>natural
  frequency, not ten.</span> </p><p><span m=''1991000''>This is a put up job. Suppose
  it had natural</span> <span m=''1994000''>frequency five. Well, in that case,</span>
  <span m=''1997000''>none of them are close to the hidden frequencies in f of t,</span>
  <span m=''2001000''>and there would be no resonance.</span> </p><p><span m=''2005000''>But,
  because of the particular value I gave here,</span> <span m=''2009000''>I gave the
  value ten, it''s able to pick out n equals</span> <span m=''2013000''>three as the
  most important, the corresponding three pi as</span> <span m=''2017000''>the most
  important frequency in the input, and respond to that.</span> </p><p><span m=''2024000''>Okay,
  so this is the way we hear, give or take a few</span> <span m=''2028000''>thousand
  pages. So, what does the ear do?</span> </p><p><span m=''2031000''>How does the
  ear, so, it''s got that thing,</span> <span m=''2035000''>messy curve, which I erased,</span>
  <span m=''2037000''>which has a secret, which just has three hidden</span> <span
  m=''2041000''>frequencies. Okay, from now on I hand wave,</span> <span m=''2045000''>right,
  like they do in other subjects.</span> </p><p><span m=''2047000''>So, we got our
  frequency. So, it''s got a [SINGS].</span> </p><p><span m=''2051000''>That''s one
  frequency. [SINGS] And,</span> <span m=''2053000''>what goes in there is the sum
  of those three,</span> <span m=''2056000''>and the ear has to do something to say
  out of all the</span> <span m=''2060000''>frequencies in the world, I''m going to
  respond to that</span> <span m=''2064000''>one, that one, and that one,</span> <span
  m=''2066000''>and send a signal to the brain, which the brain,</span> <span m=''2069000''>then,
  will interpret as a beautiful triad.</span> </p><p><span m=''2074000''>Okay, so
  what happens is that the ear, I don''t talk</span> <span m=''2077000''>physiology,
  and I never will again.</span> </p><p><span m=''2079000''>I know nothing about it,
  but anyway, the ear,</span> <span m=''2083000''>when you get far enough in there,
  there are little three</span> <span m=''2086000''>bones, bang, bang, bang; this
  is the eardrum,</span> <span m=''2090000''>and then there''s the part which has
  wax.</span> </p><p><span m=''2092000''>Then, there''s the eardrum which vibrates,
  at least if there is</span> <span m=''2097000''>not too much wax in your ear. And
  then, the vibrations go</span> <span m=''2101000''>through three little bones which
  send the vibrations to the inner</span> <span m=''2105000''>ear, which nobody ever
  sees. And, the inner ear,</span> <span m=''2110000''>then, is filled with thick
  fluid and a membrane,</span> <span m=''2113000''>and the last bone hits up against
  the membrane,</span> <span m=''2116000''>and the membrane vibrates. And, that makes
  the fluid</span> <span m=''2120000''>vibrate. Okay, good.</span> </p><p><span m=''2121000''>So,
  it''s vibrating according to the function f of t.</span> </p><p><span m=''2125000''>Well,
  what then? Well, that''s the marvelous</span> <span m=''2128000''>part. It''s almost
  impossible to</span> <span m=''2131000''>believe, but there is this, sort of like
  a snail thing</span> <span m=''2136000''>inside. I''ve forgotten the name.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2138000''>It''s cochlea. And, it has these hairs.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2141000''>They are not hairs really. I don''t know what else to call</span>
  <span m=''2145000''>them. They''re not hairs.</span> </p><p><span m=''2147000''>But,
  there are things so long, you know, they stick up.</span> </p><p><span m=''2152000''>And,
  there are 20,000 of them. And, they are of different</span> <span m=''2156000''>lengths.
  And, each one is tuned to a</span> <span m=''2159000''>certain frequency. Each one
  has a certain natural</span> <span m=''2165000''>frequency, and they are all different,
  and they are all</span> <span m=''2171000''>graded, just like a bunch of organ pipes.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2176000''>And, when that complicated wave hits, the complicated
  wave hits,</span> <span m=''2183000''>each one resonates to a hidden frequency in
  the wave,</span> <span m=''2189000''>which is closest to its natural frequency.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2195000''>Now, most of them won''t be resonating at all.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2197000''>Only the ones close to the frequency [SINGS],</span>
  <span m=''2200000''>they''ll resonate, and the nearby guys will</span> <span m=''2203000''>resonate,
  too, because they will be nearby,</span> <span m=''2205000''>almost have the same
  natural frequency.</span> </p><p><span m=''2208000''>And, over here, there will
  be a few which</span> <span m=''2210000''>resonate to [SINGS], and finally over
  here a few</span> <span m=''2213000''>which go [SINGS], and each of those little
  hairs,</span> <span m=''2216000''>little groups of hairs will signal, send that
  signal to the</span> <span m=''2220000''>auditory nerve somehow or other, which
  will then carry these</span> <span m=''2223000''>three inputs to the brain, and
  the brain,</span> <span m=''2226000''>then, will interpret that as you are hearing
  [SINGS].</span> </p><p><span m=''2231000''>So, the Fourier analysis is done by resonance.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2235000''>You here resonance because each of these things has a
  certain</span> <span m=''2241000''>natural frequency which is able, then, to pick
  out a resonant</span> <span m=''2247000''>frequency in the input. I''d like to finish
  our work on</span> <span m=''2252000''>Fourier series. So, for homework I''m asking
  you</span> <span m=''2255000''>to do something similar. Taken an input.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2258000''>I gave you a frequency here, a different omega naught,</span> <span
  m=''2262000''>a different input, as you by means of this Fourier</span> <span m=''2266000''>analysis
  to find out which it will resonate,</span> <span m=''2270000''>which of the hidden
  frequencies in the input the system will</span> <span m=''2274000''>resonate to,
  just so you can work it out yourself and do it.</span> </p><p><span m=''2280000''>Now,
  I''d like to first try to match up what I just did by this</span> <span m=''2285000''>formula
  with what''s in your book, since your book handles</span> <span m=''2290000''>the
  identical problem but a little differently,</span> <span m=''2294000''>and it''s
  essentially the same. But I think I''d better say</span> <span m=''2299000''>something
  about it. So, the book''s method,</span> <span m=''2302000''>and to the extent which
  any of these problems are worked out in</span> <span m=''2308000''>the notes, the
  notes do this, too.</span> </p><p><span m=''2312000''>Use substitution. Base uses
  differentiation of</span> <span m=''2316000''>Fourier series term by term. The work
  is almost exactly the</span> <span m=''2322000''>same as here. And, it has a slight
  advantage,</span> <span m=''2326000''>that it allows you, the book''s method has
  a slight</span> <span m=''2331000''>advantage that it allows you to forget this
  formula.</span> </p><p><span m=''2336000''>You don''t have to know this formula.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2341000''>It will come out in the wash. Now, for some of you,</span>
  <span m=''2344000''>that may be of colossal importance, in which case,</span> <span
  m=''2348000''>by all means, use the book''s method,</span> <span m=''2350000''>term
  by term. So, it requires no knowledge of</span> <span m=''2354000''>this formula
  because after all, I base this solution,</span> <span m=''2357000''>I simply wrote
  down the solution and I based it on the</span> <span m=''2361000''>fact that I was
  able to write down immediately the solution to</span> <span m=''2366000''>this and
  put as being that response.</span> </p><p><span m=''2370000''>And for that, I had
  to remember it,</span> <span m=''2372000''>or be willing to use complex exponentials
  quickly to remind</span> <span m=''2376000''>myself. There''s very,</span> <span
  m=''2378000''>very little difference between the two.</span> </p><p><span m=''2381000''>Even
  if you have to re-derive that formula,</span> <span m=''2384000''>the two take almost
  about the same length of time.</span> </p><p><span m=''2388000''>But anyway, the
  idea is simply this.</span> </p><p><span m=''2390000''>With the book, you assume.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2392000''>In other words, you take your function,</span> <span
  m=''2395000''>f of t. You expand it in a Fourier</span> <span m=''2398000''>series.
  Of course, which signs and</span> <span m=''2401000''>cosines you use will depend
  upon what the period is.</span> </p><p><span m=''2407000''>So, you assume the solution
  of the form-- Well,</span> <span m=''2410000''>if I, for example, carried out in
  this particular</span> <span m=''2414000''>case, I don''t know if I will do all
  the work,</span> <span m=''2418000''>but it would be natural to assume a solution
  of the form,</span> <span m=''2422000''>since the input looks like the green guy.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2426000''>Assume a solution which looks the same.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2430000''>In other words, it will have a constant term</span> <span m=''2433000''>because
  the input does. But all the rest of the terms</span> <span m=''2438000''>will be
  sines. So, it will be something like</span> <span m=''2442000''>(c)n times the sine
  of n pi t.</span> </p><p><span m=''2446000''>The only question is, what are the
  (c)n''s?</span> </p><p><span m=''2450000''>Well, I found one method up there.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2453000''>But, the general method is just plug-in.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2456000''>Substitute into the ODE. Substitute into the ODE.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2462000''>You differentiate this twice to do it.</span> </p><p><span m=''2464000''>So,
  I''ll do the double differentiation and I won''t stop</span> <span m=''2468000''>the
  lecture there, but I will stop the calculation</span> <span m=''2472000''>there
  because it has nothing new to offer.</span> </p><p><span m=''2475000''>And, this
  is the way all the calculations in the books and</span> <span m=''2479000''>the
  solutions and the notes are carried out.</span> </p><p><span m=''2482000''>So, I
  don''t think you''ll have any trouble.</span> </p><p><span m=''2485000''>Well, this
  term vanishes. This term becomes what?</span> </p><p><span m=''2490000''>If I differentiate
  this twice, I get summation,</span> <span m=''2493000''>so, this is one to infinity
  because I don''t know which of</span> <span m=''2497000''>these are actually going
  to appear.</span> </p><p><span m=''2500000''>Summation one to infinity, (c)n times,
  well,</span> <span m=''2503000''>if you differentiate the sine twice, you get negative
  sine,</span> <span m=''2508000''>right? Do it once: you get cosine.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2510000''>Second time: you get negative sine.</span> </p><p><span m=''2513000''>But,
  each time you will get this extra factor n pi from the</span> <span m=''2517000''>chain
  rule. And so, the answer will be</span> <span m=''2520000''>negative (c)n times
  n pi squared times the sine of n pi t.</span> </p><p><span m=''2525000''>And so,
  the procedure is,</span> <span m=''2530000''>very simply, you substitute (x)p double</span>
  <span m=''2533000''>prime into the differential equation.</span> </p><p><span m=''2536000''>In
  other words, if you do it,</span> <span m=''2537000''>we will multiply this by omega
  naught squared.</span> </p><p><span m=''2542000''>And, you add them. And then, on
  the left-hand</span> <span m=''2545000''>side, you are going to get a sum of terms,
  sine n pi t</span> <span m=''2549000''>times coefficients involving the (c)n''s.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2554000''>And, on the right, so, you''re going to get a sum</span>
  <span m=''2557000''>involving the (c)n''s, and the sines n pi t,</span> <span m=''2561000''>and
  on the right, you''re going to get the Fourier</span> <span m=''2564000''>series
  for f of t, which is exactly the same kind</span> <span m=''2569000''>of expression.
  The only difference is,</span> <span m=''2572000''>now the sines have come with
  definite coefficients.</span> </p><p><span m=''2576000''>And then, you simply click
  the coefficients on the left and the</span> <span m=''2581000''>coefficients on
  the right, and figure out what the (c)n''s</span> <span m=''2585000''>are. So, by
  equating coefficients,</span> <span m=''2590000''>you get the (c)n''s. Would you
  like me to carry it</span> <span m=''2595000''>out? Yeah, okay, I was going to do</span>
  <span m=''2599000''>something else, but I wouldn''t have time to do</span> <span
  m=''2604000''>it anyway. So, why don''t I take two</span> <span m=''2608000''>minutes
  to complete the calculation just so you can see</span> <span m=''2614000''>you get
  the same answer? All right, what do we get?</span> </p><p><span m=''2620000''>If
  you add them up, you get c naught,</span> <span m=''2623000''>out front, plus (c)n
  is multiplied by what?</span> </p><p><span m=''2627000''>Well, from the top it''s
  multiplied by omega naught</span> <span m=''2632000''>squared. On the bottom,</span>
  <span m=''2635000''>it''s multiplied by n pi squared.</span> </p><p><span m=''2640000''>Ah-ha,
  where have I seen that combination?</span> </p><p><span m=''2645000''>The sum is
  equal to, sorry, one half plus what is</span> <span m=''2655000''>it, sum over n
  odd of sine n pi t over n.</span> </p><p><span m=''2669000''>So, the conclusion
  is that-- I''m sorry, it should be c naught</span> <span m=''2674000''>times omega
  naught squared.</span> </p><p><span m=''2678000''>So, what''s the conclusion? If
  c zero is one over two omega</span> <span m=''2684000''>naught squared,</span> <span
  m=''2688000''>and that (c)n, only for n odd,</span> <span m=''2691000''>the others
  will be even. The others will be zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''2695000''>The (c)n
  is going to be equal to two over pi here.</span> </p><p><span m=''2701000''>So,
  it''s going to be two pi,</span> <span m=''2704000''>two over pi times one over
  n times one over omega naught</span> <span m=''2710000''>squared minus n over pi
  squared.</span> </p><p><span m=''2715000''>This is terrible,</span> <span m=''2720000''>which
  is the same answer we got before, I hope.</span> </p><p><span m=''2726000''>Did
  I cover it up? Same answer.</span> </p><p><span m=''2730000''>So, that answer at
  the left-hand end of the board is</span> <span m=''2735000''>the same one. I''ve
  calculated,</span> <span m=''2738000''>in other words, what the c zeros are.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2742000''>And, I got the same answer as before.</span> </p>'
