transcript: '<p><span m=''40000''>This is also written in the form, it''s the k that''s
  on the</span> <span m=''45000''>right hand side. Actually, I found that source</span>
  <span m=''49000''>is of considerable difficulty. And, in general,</span> <span m=''53000''>it
  is. For these, the temperature</span> <span m=''56000''>concentration model, it''s
  natural to have the k on</span> <span m=''61000''>the right-hand side, and to separate
  out the (q)e as</span> <span m=''65000''>part of it. Another model for which that''s</span>
  <span m=''70000''>true is mixing, as I think I will show you on</span> <span m=''74000''>Monday.
  On the other hand,</span> <span m=''76000''>there are some common first-order models
  for which</span> <span m=''81000''>it''s not a natural way to separate things out.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''85000''>Examples would be the RC circuit, radioactive decay,</span>
  <span m=''89000''>stuff like that. So, this is not a universal</span> <span m=''94000''>utility.
  But I thought that that form of</span> <span m=''98000''>writing it was a sufficient
  utility to make a special case,</span> <span m=''103000''>and I emphasize it very
  heavily in the nodes.</span> </p><p><span m=''107000''>Let''s look at the equation.
  And, this form will be good</span> <span m=''112000''>enough, the y prime. When
  you solve it,</span> <span m=''116000''>let me remind you how the solutions look,</span>
  <span m=''120000''>because that explains the terminology.</span> </p><p><span m=''125000''>The
  solution looks like, after you have done the</span> <span m=''128000''>integrating
  factor and multiplied through,</span> <span m=''131000''>and integrated both sides,
  in short, what you''re supposed</span> <span m=''136000''>to do, the solution looks
  like y equals, there''s the term e to</span> <span m=''140000''>the negative k out
  front times an integral which</span> <span m=''145000''>you can either make definite
  or indefinite, according to your</span> <span m=''150000''>preference. q of t times
  e to the kt inside</span> <span m=''154000''>dt, it will help you to remember</span>
  <span m=''157000''>the opposite signs if you think that when q is a constant,</span>
  <span m=''161000''>one, for example, you want these two guys to</span> <span m=''164000''>cancel
  out and produce a constant solution.</span> </p><p><span m=''167000''>That''s a
  good way to remember that the signs have to be</span> <span m=''170000''>opposite.
  But, I don''t encourage you to</span> <span m=''173000''>remember the formula at
  all. It''s just a convenient thing</span> <span m=''176000''>for me to be able to
  use right now.</span> </p><p><span m=''180000''>And then, there''s the other term,
  which comes by putting up</span> <span m=''184000''>the arbitrary constant explicitly,
  c e to the negative</span> <span m=''189000''>kt. So, you could either write it</span>
  <span m=''192000''>this way, where this is somewhat vague, or you could make it</span>
  <span m=''197000''>definite by putting a zero here and a t there,</span> <span m=''201000''>and
  change the dummy variable inside according to the way the</span> <span m=''206000''>notes
  tell you to do it. Now, when you do this,</span> <span m=''211000''>and if k is
  positive, that''s absolutely essential,</span> <span m=''215000''>only when that
  is so, then this term,</span> <span m=''219000''>as I told you a week or so ago,
  this term goes to zero because</span> <span m=''225000''>k is positive as t goes
  to infinity.</span> </p><p><span m=''228000''>So, this goes to zero as t goes, and
  it doesn''t matter what</span> <span m=''233000''>c is, as t goes to infinity. This
  term stays some sort of</span> <span m=''239000''>function. And so, this term is
  called the</span> <span m=''243000''>steady-state or long-term solution, or it''s
  called both,</span> <span m=''248000''>a long-term solution. And this, which disappears,</span>
  <span m=''254000''>gets smaller and smaller as time goes on,</span> <span m=''257000''>is
  therefore called the transient because it disappears</span> <span m=''261000''>at
  the time increases to infinity.</span> </p><p><span m=''264000''>So, this part uses
  the initial condition, uses the initial</span> <span m=''268000''>value. Let''s
  call it y of zero,</span> <span m=''271000''>assuming that you started the initial
  value,</span> <span m=''275000''>t, when t was equal to zero, which is a common
  thing to do,</span> <span m=''280000''>although of course not necessary.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''284000''>The starting value appears in this term.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''287000''>This one is just some function. Now, the general picture or the</span>
  <span m=''293000''>way that looks is, the steady-state solution will</span> <span
  m=''297000''>be some solution like, I don''t know,</span> <span m=''301000''>like
  that, let''s say. So, that''s a steady-state</span> <span m=''305000''>solution,
  the SSS. Well, what do the other guys</span> <span m=''309000''>look like? Well,
  the steady-state solution</span> <span m=''312000''>has this starting point. Other
  solutions can have any of</span> <span m=''316000''>these other starting points.
  So, in the beginning,</span> <span m=''320000''>they won''t look like the steady-state
  solution.</span> </p><p><span m=''323000''>But, we know that as time goes on, they
  must approach it</span> <span m=''327000''>because this term represents the difference
  between the solution</span> <span m=''331000''>and the steady-state solution. So,
  this term is going to zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''337000''>And therefore, whatever
  these guys do to start</span> <span m=''341000''>out with, after a while they must
  follow the steady-state</span> <span m=''345000''>solution more and more closely.
  They must, in short,</span> <span m=''349000''>be asymptotic to it. So, the solutions
  to any</span> <span m=''353000''>equation of that form will look like this.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''356000''>Up here, maybe it started at 127.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''358000''>That''s okay. After a while,</span> <span m=''360000''>it''s going
  to start approaching that green curve.</span> </p><p><span m=''366000''>Of course,
  they won''t cross each other.</span> </p><p><span m=''369000''>That''s the rock
  star, and these are the groupies</span> <span m=''373000''>trying to get close to
  it. Now, but something follows from</span> <span m=''378000''>that picture. Which
  is the steady-state</span> <span m=''382000''>solution? What, in short,</span> <span
  m=''384000''>is so special about this green curve?</span> </p><p><span m=''387000''>All
  these other white solution curves have that same property,</span> <span m=''393000''>the
  same property that all the other white curves and the green</span> <span m=''398000''>curve,
  too, are trying to get close to them.</span> </p><p><span m=''404000''>In other
  words, there is nothing special about</span> <span m=''407000''>the green curve.
  It''s just that they all want to</span> <span m=''411000''>get close to each other.
  And therefore,</span> <span m=''414000''>though you can write a formula like this,
  there isn''t one</span> <span m=''418000''>steady-state solution. There are many.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''421000''>Now, this produces vagueness. You talk about the steady-state</span>
  <span m=''427000''>solution; which one are you talking about?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''429000''>I have no answer to that; the usual answer is whichever</span> <span
  m=''433000''>one looks simplest. Normally, the one that will</span> <span m=''436000''>look
  simplest is the one where c is zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''439000''>But, if this
  is a peculiar function, it might be that for</span> <span m=''443000''>some other
  value of c, you get an even simpler</span> <span m=''446000''>expression. So, the
  steady-state solution:</span> <span m=''449000''>about the best I can see, either
  you integrate that,</span> <span m=''452000''>don''t use an arbitrary constant,
  and use what you get,</span> <span m=''456000''>or pick the simplest. Pick the value
  of c,</span> <span m=''461000''>which gives you the simplest answer.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''466000''>Pick the simplest function, and that''s what usually called</span>
  <span m=''473000''>the steady-state solution. Now, from that point of view,</span>
  <span m=''480000''>what I''m calling the input in this input response point of</span>
  <span m=''485000''>view, which we are going to be using, by the way,</span> <span
  m=''488000''>constantly, well, pretty much all term long,</span> <span m=''492000''>but
  certainly for the next month or so, I''m constantly</span> <span m=''496000''>going
  to be coming back to it. The input is the q of t.</span> </p><p><span m=''501000''>In
  other words,</span> <span m=''503000''>it seems rather peculiar. But the input is
  the right-hand</span> <span m=''507000''>side of the equation of the differential
  equation.</span> </p><p><span m=''511000''>And the reason is because I''m always
  thinking of the</span> <span m=''515000''>temperature model. The external water
  bath at</span> <span m=''521000''>temperature T external, the internal thing here,</span>
  <span m=''524000''>the problem is, given this function,</span> <span m=''527000''>the
  external water bath temperature is driving,</span> <span m=''531000''>so to speak,
  the temperature of the inside.</span> </p><p><span m=''534000''>And therefore, the
  input is the temperature of</span> <span m=''537000''>the water bath. I don''t like
  the word output,</span> <span m=''541000''>although it would be the natural thing
  because this</span> <span m=''545000''>temperature doesn''t look like an output.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''547000''>Anyone might be willing to say, yeah, you are inputting
  the</span> <span m=''551000''>value of the temperature here. This, it''s more likely,</span>
  <span m=''555000''>the normal term is response. This thing, this plus the water</span>
  <span m=''559000''>bath, is a little system. And the response of the system,</span>
  <span m=''562000''>i.e. the change in the internal</span> <span m=''564000''>temperature
  is governed by the driving external temperature.</span> </p><p><span m=''568000''>So,
  the input is q of t, and the response of</span> <span m=''572000''>the system is
  the solution to the differential equation.</span> </p><p><span m=''585000''>Now,
  if the thing is special, as it''s going to be for most of</span> <span m=''589000''>this
  period, it has that special form, then I''m going to,</span> <span m=''594000''>I
  really want to call q sub e the input.</span> </p><p><span m=''598000''>I want to
  call q sub e the input, and there is no standard</span> <span m=''602000''>way of
  doing that, although there''s a most common</span> <span m=''606000''>way. So, I''m
  just calling it the</span> <span m=''610000''>physical input, in other words,</span>
  <span m=''612000''>the temperature input, or the concentration input.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''616000''>And, that will be my (q)e of t, and by the</span> <span m=''621000''>subscript
  e, you will understand that I''m writing it in that form</span> <span m=''626000''>and
  thinking of this model, or concentration model,</span> <span m=''630000''>or mixing
  model as I will show you on Monday.</span> </p><p><span m=''635000''>By the way,
  this is often handled, I mean,</span> <span m=''637000''>how would you handle this
  to get rid of a k?</span> </p><p><span m=''641000''>Well, divide through by k. So,
  this equation is often,</span> <span m=''645000''>in the literature, written this
  way:</span> <span m=''647000''>one over k times y prime plus y is equal to, well,</span>
  <span m=''651000''>now they call it q of t, not (q)e of t because they''ve</span>
  <span m=''655000''>gotten rid of this funny factor. But</span> <span m=''659000''>I
  will continue to call it (q)e. So, in other words,</span> <span m=''664000''>and
  this part this is just, frankly, called the input.</span> </p><p><span m=''669000''>It
  doesn''t say physical or anything.</span> </p><p><span m=''671000''>And, this is
  the solution, it''s then the response,</span> <span m=''676000''>and this funny
  coefficient of y prime,</span> <span m=''679000''>that''s not in standard linear
  form, is it, anymore?</span> </p><p><span m=''683000''>But, it''s a standard form
  if you want to do this input</span> <span m=''688000''>response analysis. So, this
  is also a way of</span> <span m=''691000''>writing the equation. I''m not going
  to use it because</span> <span m=''698000''>how many standard forms could this poor
  little course absorb?</span> </p><p><span m=''703000''>I''ll stick to that one.
  Okay, you have,</span> <span m=''707000''>then, the superposition principle, which
  I don''t think</span> <span m=''712000''>I''m going to-- the solution, which solution?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''717000''>Well, normally it means any solution, or in other words,</span>
  <span m=''722000''>the steady-state solution. Now, notice that terminology</span>
  <span m=''727000''>only makes sense if k is positive.</span> </p><p><span m=''730000''>And,
  in fact, there is nothing like the</span> <span m=''733000''>picture, the picture
  doesn''t look at all like this if k is</span> <span m=''737000''>negative, and therefore,
  the terms would steady state,</span> <span m=''740000''>transient would be totally
  inappropriate if k were</span> <span m=''744000''>negative. So, this assumes definitely</span>
  <span m=''746000''>that k has to be greater than zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''750000''>Otherwise,
  no. So, I''ll call this the physical</span> <span m=''753000''>input. And then,
  you have the</span> <span m=''755000''>superposition principle, which I really can''t
  improve</span> <span m=''760000''>upon what''s written in the notes, this superposition
  of</span> <span m=''764000''>inputs. Whether they are physical</span> <span m=''767000''>inputs
  or nonphysical inputs, if the input q of t produces</span> <span m=''771000''>the
  response, y of t,</span> <span m=''774000''>and q two of t produces the response,
  y two of t,</span> <span m=''782000''>-- then a simple calculation with the differential
  equation</span> <span m=''787000''>shows you that by, so to speak,</span> <span
  m=''790000''>adding, that the sum of these two, I stated it very generally</span>
  <span m=''795000''>in the notes but it corresponds, we will have as the response</span>
  <span m=''801000''>y1, the steady-state response y1 plus y2,</span> <span m=''805000''>and
  a constant times y1. That''s an expression,</span> <span m=''810000''>essentially,
  of the linear,</span> <span m=''812000''>it uses the fact that the special form
  of the equation,</span> <span m=''815000''>and we will have a very efficient and
  elegant way of</span> <span m=''818000''>seeing this when we study higher order
  equations.</span> </p><p><span m=''821000''>For now, I will just, the little calculation
  that''s</span> <span m=''825000''>done in the notes will suffice for first-order
  equations.</span> </p><p><span m=''828000''>If you don''t have a complicated equation,
  there''s no point in</span> <span m=''832000''>making a fuss over proofs using it.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''834000''>But essentially, it uses the fact that the</span> <span
  m=''837000''>equation is linear. Or, that''s bad,</span> <span m=''841000''>so linearity
  of the ODE. In other words,</span> <span m=''844000''>it''s a consequence of the
  fact that the equation looks the way</span> <span m=''849000''>it does. And, something
  like this would</span> <span m=''852000''>not, in any sense, be true if the equation,</span>
  <span m=''855000''>for example, had here a y squared</span> <span m=''858000''>instead
  of t. Everything I''m saying this</span> <span m=''861000''>period would be total
  nonsense and totally inapplicable.</span> </p><p><span m=''867000''>Now, today,
  what I wanted to discuss was, what''s in the notes</span> <span m=''872000''>that
  I gave you today, which is, what happens when the</span> <span m=''876000''>physical
  input is trigonometric? For certain reasons,</span> <span m=''881000''>that''s the
  most important case there is.</span> </p><p><span m=''884000''>It''s because of
  the existence of what are called Fourier</span> <span m=''889000''>series, and there
  are a couple of words about them.</span> </p><p><span m=''893000''>That''s something
  we will be studying in about three weeks or</span> <span m=''898000''>so. What''s
  going on,</span> <span m=''901000''>roughly, is that, so I''m going to take the</span>
  <span m=''906000''>equation in the form y prime plus ky equals k times</span> <span
  m=''912000''>(q)e of t, and the input that I''m</span> <span m=''917000''>interested
  in is when this is a simple one that you use on the</span> <span m=''923000''>visual
  that you did about two points worth of work for handing</span> <span m=''930000''>in
  today, cosine omega t.</span> </p><p><span m=''936000''>So, if you like, k here.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''937000''>So, the (q)e is cosine omega t. That was the physical
  input.</span> </p><p><span m=''941000''>And, omega, as you know, is, you have to
  be careful when</span> <span m=''944000''>you use the word frequency. I assume you
  got this from</span> <span m=''948000''>physics class all last semester. But anyway,
  just to remind you,</span> <span m=''952000''>there''s a whole yoga of five or six
  terms that go whenever</span> <span m=''956000''>you''re talking about trigonometric
  functions.</span> </p><p><span m=''960000''>Instead of giving a long explanation,
  the end of the</span> <span m=''963000''>second page of the notes just gives you
  a reference list of</span> <span m=''968000''>what you are expected to know for
  18.03 and physics as well,</span> <span m=''972000''>with a brief one or two line
  description of what each of</span> <span m=''977000''>those means. So, think of
  it as something to</span> <span m=''980000''>refer back to if you have forgotten.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''983000''>But, omega is what''s called the angular frequency or
  the</span> <span m=''987000''>circular frequency. It''s somewhat misleading to</span>
  <span m=''991000''>call it the frequency, although I probably will.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''996000''>It''s the angular frequency. It''s, in other words,</span> <span m=''999000''>it''s
  the number of complete oscillations.</span> </p><p><span m=''1002000''>This cosine
  omega t is going up and down right?</span> </p><p><span m=''1007000''>So, a complete
  oscillation as it goes down and then returns to</span> <span m=''1011000''>where
  it started. That''s a complete oscillation.</span> </p><p><span m=''1015000''>This
  is only half an oscillation because you didn''t</span> <span m=''1018000''>give
  it a chance to get back. Okay, so the number of complete</span> <span m=''1023000''>oscillations
  in how much time, well, in two pi,</span> <span m=''1026000''>in the distance, two
  pi on the t-axis in the</span> <span m=''1029000''>interval of length two pi because,
  for example,</span> <span m=''1033000''>if omega is one, cosine t takes two</span>
  <span m=''1036000''>pi to repeat itself, right?</span> </p><p><span m=''1040000''>If
  omega were two, it would repeat itself.</span> </p><p><span m=''1043000''>It would
  make two complete oscillations in the interval,</span> <span m=''1048000''>two pi.
  So, it''s what happens to the</span> <span m=''1051000''>interval, two pi, not what
  happens in the time</span> <span m=''1055000''>interval, one, which is the natural
  meaning of</span> <span m=''1059000''>the word frequency. There''s always this factor
  of</span> <span m=''1063000''>two pi that floats around to make all of your formulas
  and</span> <span m=''1068000''>solutions incorrect. Okay, now, so,</span> <span
  m=''1071000''>what I''m out to do is, the problem is for the physical</span> <span
  m=''1075000''>input, (q)e cosine omega t,</span> <span m=''1079000''>find the response.
  In other words,</span> <span m=''1082000''>solve the differential equation.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1087000''>In short, for the visual that you looked at,</span> <span
  m=''1091000''>I think I''ve forgot the colors now.</span> </p><p><span m=''1094000''>The
  input was in green, maybe, but I do remember that</span> <span m=''1099000''>the
  response was in yellow. I think I remember that.</span> </p><p><span m=''1104000''>So,
  find the response, yellow, and the input was,</span> <span m=''1108000''>what color
  was it, green?</span> </p><p><span m=''1110000''>Blue, blue. Light blue.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1114000''>Okay, so we''ve got to solve the differential equation.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1119000''>Now, it''s a question of how I''m going to solve the
  differential</span> <span m=''1126000''>equation. I''m going to use complex</span>
  <span m=''1129000''>numbers throughout, A because that''s the way it''s</span> <span
  m=''1134000''>usually done. B, to give you practice using</span> <span m=''1139000''>complex
  numbers, and I don''t think I need any</span> <span m=''1144000''>other reasons.
  So, I''m going to use complex</span> <span m=''1149000''>numbers. I''m going to
  complexify.</span> </p><p><span m=''1153000''>To use complex numbers, what you do
  is complexification</span> <span m=''1158000''>of the problem. So, I''m going to
  complexify the</span> <span m=''1163000''>problem, turn it into the domain of complex
  numbers.</span> </p><p><span m=''1169000''>So, take the differential equation, turn
  it into a</span> <span m=''1173000''>differential equation involving complex numbers,</span>
  <span m=''1177000''>solve that, and then go back to the real domain to get the</span>
  <span m=''1182000''>answer, since it''s easier to integrate exponentials.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1186000''>And therefore, try to introduce,</span> <span m=''1189000''>try
  to change the trigonometric functions into complex</span> <span m=''1193000''>exponentials,
  simply because the work will be</span> <span m=''1197000''>easier to do. All right,
  so let''s do it.</span> </p><p><span m=''1202000''>To change this differential equation,
  remember,</span> <span m=''1205000''>I''ve got cosine omega t here.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1209000''>I''m going to use the fact that e to the i omega t,</span> <span m=''1214000''>Euler''s
  formula, that the real part of it is</span> <span m=''1217000''>cosine omega t.
  So, I''m going to view this as</span> <span m=''1222000''>the real part of this
  complex function.</span> </p><p><span m=''1225000''>But, I will throw at the imaginary
  part,</span> <span m=''1228000''>too, since at one point we will need it.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1231000''>Now, what is the equation, then, that it''s going to
  turn</span> <span m=''1236000''>into? The complexified equation is</span> <span
  m=''1241000''>going to be y prime plus ky equals, and now,</span> <span m=''1246000''>instead
  of the right hand side, k times cosine omega t,</span> <span m=''1253000''>I''ll
  use the whole complex exponential, e i omega t.</span> </p><p><span m=''1260000''>Now,
  I have a problem because</span> <span m=''1266000''>y, here, in this equation, y
  means the real function which</span> <span m=''1269000''>solves that problem. I
  therefore cannot continue to</span> <span m=''1273000''>call this y because I want
  y to be a real function.</span> </p><p><span m=''1276000''>I have to change its
  name. Since this is complex function</span> <span m=''1280000''>on the right-hand
  side, I will have to expect a complex</span> <span m=''1284000''>solution to the
  differential equation.</span> </p><p><span m=''1288000''>I''m going to call that
  complex solution y tilda.</span> </p><p><span m=''1292000''>Now, that''s what I
  would also use as the designation for the</span> <span m=''1298000''>variable. So,
  y tilda is the complex</span> <span m=''1302000''>solution. And, it''s going to
  have the</span> <span m=''1306000''>form y1 plus i times y2.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1309000''>It''s going to be the complex solution.</span> </p><p><span m=''1313000''>And
  now, what I say is, so, solve it.</span> </p><p><span m=''1317000''>Find this complex
  solution. So, find the program is to find</span> <span m=''1323000''>y tilde, --
  -- that''s the complex solution.</span> </p><p><span m=''1328000''>And then I say,
  all you have to do is take the</span> <span m=''1332000''>real part of that, and
  that will answer the</span> <span m=''1336000''>original problem. Then, y1, that''s
  the real part</span> <span m=''1340000''>of it, right? It''s a function,</span>
  <span m=''1343000''>you know, like this is cosine plus sine, as it was over here,</span>
  <span m=''1348000''>it will naturally be something different.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1351000''>It will be something different, but that part of it,</span> <span
  m=''1356000''>the real part will solve the original problem,</span> <span m=''1360000''>the
  original, real, ODE.</span> </p><p><span m=''1364000''>Now, you will say, you expect
  us to believe that?</span> </p><p><span m=''1367000''>Well, yes, in fact. I think
  we''ve got a lot to do,</span> <span m=''1371000''>so since the argument for this
  is given in the nodes,</span> <span m=''1374000''>so, read this in the notes. It
  only takes a line or two of</span> <span m=''1378000''>standard work with differentiation.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1382000''>So, read in the notes the argument for that,</span> <span
  m=''1385000''>why that''s so. It just amounts to separating</span> <span m=''1389000''>real
  and imaginary parts. Okay, so let''s,</span> <span m=''1393000''>now, solve this.
  Since that''s our program,</span> <span m=''1397000''>all we have to find is the
  solution.</span> </p><p><span m=''1400000''>Well, just use integrating factors and
  just do it.</span> </p><p><span m=''1405000''>So, the integrating factor will be,
  what, e to the,</span> <span m=''1409000''>I don''t want to use that formula.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1414000''>So, the integrating factor will be e to the kt is the</span>
  <span m=''1418000''>integrating factor. If I multiply through both</span> <span
  m=''1422000''>sides by the integrating factor, then the left-hand side will</span>
  <span m=''1426000''>become y e to the kt, the way it always does,</span> <span m=''1430000''>prime,
  Y tilde, sorry,</span> <span m=''1433000''>and the right-hand side will be, now
  I''m going to start</span> <span m=''1437000''>combining exponentials. It will be
  k times e to the</span> <span m=''1443000''>power i times omega t plus k.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1451000''>I''m going to write that k plus omega t.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1471000''>i omega t plus k.</span> </p><p><span m=''1476000''>Thank you. i omega
  t plus k,</span> <span m=''1480000''>or k plus i omega t.</span> </p><p><span m=''1487000''>kt?
  Sorry.</span> </p><p><span m=''1488000''>So, it''s k times e to the i omega t times
  e to the kt.</span> </p><p><span m=''1497000''>So, that''s (k plus i omega)</span>
  <span m=''1506000''>times t. Sorry.</span> </p><p><span m=''1510000''>So, y tilda
  e to the kt is k divided by,</span> <span m=''1517000''>now I integrate this, so
  it essentially reproduces</span> <span m=''1523000''>itself, except you have to
  put down on the bottom k plus i</span> <span m=''1530000''>omega. I''ll take the
  final step.</span> </p><p><span m=''1535000''>What''s y tilda equals, see, when
  you do it this way,</span> <span m=''1538000''>then you don''t get a messy looking
  formula that you</span> <span m=''1542000''>substitute into and that is scary looking.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1544000''>This is never scary. Now, I''m going to do two things</span>
  <span m=''1548000''>simultaneously. First of all,</span> <span m=''1549000''>here,
  if I multiply, after I get the answer,</span> <span m=''1552000''>I''m going to
  want to multiply it by e to the negative kt,</span> <span m=''1556000''>right, to
  solve for y tilda.</span> </p><p><span m=''1560000''>If I multiply this by e to
  the negative kt, then that just gets</span> <span m=''1564000''>rid of the k that
  I put in, and left back with e to the i</span> <span m=''1568000''>omega t. So,
  that side is easy.</span> </p><p><span m=''1570000''>All that is left is e to the
  i omega t.</span> </p><p><span m=''1574000''>Now, what''s interesting is this thing
  out here,</span> <span m=''1578000''>k plus i omega. I''m going to take a typical</span>
  <span m=''1582000''>step of scaling it. And you scale it.</span> </p><p><span m=''1584000''>I''m
  going to divide the top and bottom by k.</span> </p><p><span m=''1589000''>And,
  what does that produce? One divided by one plus i times</span> <span m=''1595000''>omega
  over k.</span> </p><p><span m=''1600000''>What I''ve done is take these two separate
  constants,</span> <span m=''1605000''>and shown that the critical thing is their
  ratio.</span> </p><p><span m=''1611000''>Okay, now, what I have to do now is take
  the real part.</span> </p><p><span m=''1617000''>Now, there are two ways to do this.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1621000''>There are two ways to do this. Both are instructive.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1628000''>So, there are two methods. I have a multiplication.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1633000''>The problem is, of course, that these two</span> <span
  m=''1637000''>things are multiplied together. And, one of them is,</span> <span
  m=''1643000''>essentially, in Cartesian form,</span> <span m=''1646000''>and the
  other is, essentially,</span> <span m=''1649000''>in polar form. You have to make
  a decision.</span> </p><p><span m=''1655000''>Either go polar, it sounds like go
  postal,</span> <span m=''1660000''>doesn''t it, or worse, like a bear,</span> <span
  m=''1665000''>savage, attack it savagely, which that''s a very good,</span> <span
  m=''1672000''>aggressive attitude to have when doing a problem,</span> <span m=''1678000''>or
  we can go Cartesian. Going polar is a little faster,</span> <span m=''1685000''>and
  I think it''s what''s done in the nodes.</span> </p><p><span m=''1688000''>The notes
  to do both of these. They just do the first.</span> </p><p><span m=''1691000''>On
  the other hand, they give you a formula,</span> <span m=''1694000''>which is the
  critical thing that you will need to go</span> <span m=''1698000''>Cartesian. I
  hope I can do both of them if</span> <span m=''1701000''>we sort of hurry along.
  How do I go polar?</span> </p><p><span m=''1704000''>To go polar, what you want
  to do is express</span> <span m=''1707000''>this thing in polar form. Now, one of
  the things I didn''t</span> <span m=''1712000''>emphasize enough, probably, when
  I talked to you</span> <span m=''1715000''>about complex numbers last time is, so
  I will remind you,</span> <span m=''1720000''>which saves my conscience and doesn''t
  hurt yours,</span> <span m=''1723000''>suppose you have alpha as a complex number.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1727000''>See, this complex number is a reciprocal.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1730000''>The good number is what''s down below.</span> </p><p><span m=''1732000''>Unfortunately,
  it''s downstairs.</span> </p><p><span m=''1735000''>You should know, like you know
  the back of your</span> <span m=''1738000''>hand, which nobody knows, one over alpha.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1743000''>So that''s the form. The number I''m interested in,</span>
  <span m=''1745000''>that coefficient, it is of the form one over</span> <span m=''1748000''>alpha.
  One over alpha times alpha is</span> <span m=''1750000''>equal to one.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1753000''>And, from that, it follows, first of all,</span> <span m=''1755000''>if
  I take absolute values, if the absolute value of one</span> <span m=''1759000''>over
  alpha times the absolute value of this is equal to one,</span> <span m=''1762000''>so,
  this is equal to one over the absolute value of alpha.</span> </p><p><span m=''1766000''>I
  think you all knew that. I''m a little less certain you</span> <span m=''1769000''>knew
  how to take care of the angles.</span> </p><p><span m=''1773000''>How about the
  argument? Well, the argument of the</span> <span m=''1776000''>angle, in other words,
  the angle of one over alpha</span> <span m=''1780000''>plus, because when you multiply,
  angles add.</span> </p><p><span m=''1784000''>Remember that. Plus, the angle associated
  with</span> <span m=''1788000''>alpha has to be the angle associated with one.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1791000''>But what''s that? One is out here.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1794000''>What''s the angle of one? Zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''1806000''>Therefore,
  the argument, the absolute value of this</span> <span m=''1810000''>thing is want
  over the absolute value.</span> </p><p><span m=''1814000''>That''s easy. And, you
  should know that the</span> <span m=''1818000''>argument of want over alpha is equal
  to minus the argument of</span> <span m=''1823000''>alpha. So, when you take reciprocal,</span>
  <span m=''1827000''>the angle turns into its negative.</span> </p><p><span m=''1830000''>Okay,
  I''m going to use that now, because my aim is to turn</span> <span m=''1835000''>this
  into polar form. So, let''s do that someplace,</span> <span m=''1840000''>I guess
  here. So, I want the polar form for</span> <span m=''1848000''>one over one plus
  i times omega over k.</span> </p><p><span m=''1860000''>Okay, I will draw a picture.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1864000''>Here''s one. Here is omega over k.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1869000''>Let''s call this angle phi.</span> </p><p><span m=''1872000''>It''s
  a natural thing to call it.</span> </p><p><span m=''1875000''>It''s a right triangle,
  of course.</span> </p><p><span m=''1878000''>Okay, now, this is going to be a complex
  number times e to an</span> <span m=''1884000''>angle. Now, what''s the angle going
  to</span> <span m=''1888000''>be? Well, this is a complex number,</span> <span m=''1892000''>the
  angle for the complex number.</span> </p><p><span m=''1895000''>So, the argument
  of the complex number, one plus i times omega</span> <span m=''1900000''>over k
  is how much?</span> </p><p><span m=''1903000''>Well, there''s the complex number
  one plus i over one plus</span> <span m=''1908000''>i times omega over k.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1913000''>Its angle is phi. So, the argument of this is</span>
  <span m=''1917000''>phi, and therefore, the argument of its reciprocal</span> <span
  m=''1921000''>is negative phi. So, it''s e to the minus i phi.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1926000''>And, what''s A?</span> </p><p><span m=''1929000''>A is one over the
  absolute value of that complex number.</span> </p><p><span m=''1934000''>Well, the
  absolute value of this complex number is one plus</span> <span m=''1940000''>omega
  over k squared.</span> </p><p><span m=''1944000''>So, the A is going to be one over
  that, the square root of</span> <span m=''1949000''>one plus omega over k, the quantity
  squared,</span> <span m=''1953000''>times e to the minus i phi.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1959000''>See, I did that.</span> </p><p><span m=''1963000''>That''s a critical
  step. You must turn that coefficient.</span> </p><p><span m=''1966000''>If you want
  to go polar, you must turn is that</span> <span m=''1969000''>coefficient, write
  that coefficient in the polar form.</span> </p><p><span m=''1972000''>And for that,
  you need these basic facts</span> <span m=''1974000''>about, draw the complex number,
  draw its angle,</span> <span m=''1977000''>and so on and so forth. And now, what''s
  there for the</span> <span m=''1982000''>solution? Once you''ve done that,</span>
  <span m=''1986000''>the work is over. What''s the complex solution?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1990000''>The complex solution is this. I''ve just found the polar form</span>
  <span m=''1996000''>for this. So, I multiply it by e to the i</span> <span m=''2000000''>omega
  t, which means these things add.</span> </p><p><span m=''2005000''>So, it''s equal
  to A, this A, times e to the i omega</span> <span m=''2010000''>t minus i times
  phi.</span> </p><p><span m=''2017000''>Or, in other words, the coefficient is one
  over,</span> <span m=''2022000''>this is a real number, now, square root of one
  plus</span> <span m=''2027000''>omega over k squared.</span> </p><p><span m=''2033000''>And,
  this is e to the, see if I get it right,</span> <span m=''2038000''>now. And finally,</span>
  <span m=''2040000''>now, what''s the answer to our real problem?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2045000''>y1: the real answer. I mean: the really real answer.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2051000''>What is it? Well, this is a real number.</span> </p><p><span m=''2053000''>So,
  I simply reproduce that as the coefficient out front.</span> </p><p><span m=''2057000''>And
  for the other part, I want the real part of that.</span> </p><p><span m=''2060000''>But
  you can write that down instantly.</span> </p><p><span m=''2063000''>So, let''s
  recopy the coefficient.</span> </p><p><span m=''2065000''>And then, I want just
  the real part of this.</span> </p><p><span m=''2068000''>Well, this is e to the
  i times some crazy angle.</span> </p><p><span m=''2072000''>So, the real part is
  the cosine of that crazy angle.</span> </p><p><span m=''2076000''>So, it''s the
  cosine of omega t minus phi.</span> </p><p><span m=''2080000''>And, if somebody
  says,</span> <span m=''2082000''>yeah, well, okay, I got the omega k,</span> <span
  m=''2085000''>I know what that is. That came from the problem,</span> <span m=''2089000''>the
  driving frequency, driving angular frequency.</span> </p><p><span m=''2092000''>That
  was omega, and k, I guess,</span> <span m=''2095000''>k was the conductivity, the
  thing which told you how</span> <span m=''2099000''>quickly the heat that penetrated
  the walls of the little inner</span> <span m=''2103000''>chamber. So, that''s okay,</span>
  <span m=''2107000''>but what''s this phi? Well, the best way to get phi</span> <span
  m=''2111000''>is just to draw that picture, but if you want a formula for</span>
  <span m=''2115000''>phi, phi will be, well, I guess from the picture,</span> <span
  m=''2119000''>it''s the arc tangent of omega, k, divided by k,</span> <span m=''2123000''>over
  one, which I don''t have to put</span> <span m=''2128000''>in. So, it''s this number,</span>
  <span m=''2130000''>phi, in reference to this function.</span> </p><p><span m=''2134000''>See,
  if the phi weren''t there, this would be cosine omega t,</span> <span m=''2139000''>and
  we all know what that looks</span> <span m=''2144000''>like. The phi is called the
  phase lag</span> <span m=''2148000''>or phase delay, something like that,</span>
  <span m=''2151000''>the phase lag of the function. What does it represent?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2156000''>It represents, let me draw you a picture.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2162000''>Let''s draw the picture like this.</span> </p><p><span m=''2165000''>Here''s
  cosine omega t.</span> </p><p><span m=''2168000''>Now, regular cosine would look
  sort of like that.</span> </p><p><span m=''2173000''>But, I will indicate that the
  angular frequency is not one by</span> <span m=''2178000''>making my cosine squinchy
  up a little too much.</span> </p><p><span m=''2183000''>Everybody can tell that
  that''s the cosine on a limp axis,</span> <span m=''2188000''>something for Salvador
  Dali, okay.</span> </p><p><span m=''2191000''>So, there''s cosine of something.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2196000''>So, what was it? Blue?</span> </p><p><span m=''2197000''>I
  don''t have blue. Yes, I have blue.</span> </p><p><span m=''2201000''>Okay, so now
  you will know what I''m talking about because this</span> <span m=''2206000''>looks
  just like the screen on your computer when you put in</span> <span m=''2212000''>the
  visual for this. Frequency: your response order</span> <span m=''2216000''>one.
  So, this is cosine omega t.</span> </p><p><span m=''2219000''>Now, how will cosine
  omega t</span> <span m=''2224000''>minus phi look?</span> </p><p><span m=''2227000''>Well,
  it''ll be moved over. Let''s, for example,</span> <span m=''2230000''>suppose phi
  were pi over two. Now, where''s pi over two on the</span> <span m=''2235000''>picture?
  Well, what I do is cosine omega</span> <span m=''2238000''>t minus this. I move
  it over by one,</span> <span m=''2242000''>so that this point becomes that one,
  and it looks like,</span> <span m=''2246000''>the site will look like this. In other
  words,</span> <span m=''2250000''>I shove it over by, so this is the point where</span>
  <span m=''2253000''>omega t equals pi over two.</span> </p><p><span m=''2259000''>It''s
  not the value of t. It''s not the value of t.</span> </p><p><span m=''2263000''>It''s
  the value of omega t.</span> </p><p><span m=''2266000''>And, when I do that, then
  the blue curve has been</span> <span m=''2270000''>shoved over one quarter of its
  total cycle, and that turns it,</span> <span m=''2275000''>of course, into the sine
  curve, which I hope I can draw.</span> </p><p><span m=''2281000''>So, this goes
  up to there, and then, it''s got to get back</span> <span m=''2285000''>through.
  Let me stop there while I''m</span> <span m=''2288000''>ahead. So, this is sine
  omega t,</span> <span m=''2291000''>the yellow thing,</span> <span m=''2293000''>but
  that''s also, in another life,</span> <span m=''2296000''>cosine of omega t minus
  pi over two.</span> </p><p><span m=''2301000''>The main thing is you don''t subtract,
  the pi over two is not</span> <span m=''2306000''>being subtracted from the t. It''s
  being subtracted from the</span> <span m=''2312000''>whole expression, and this
  whole expression</span> <span m=''2315000''>represents an angle, which tells you
  where you are</span> <span m=''2319000''>in the travel, a long cosine to this.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2321000''>What this quantity gets to be two pi, you''re back where
  you</span> <span m=''2326000''>started. That''s not the distance on the</span> <span
  m=''2329000''>t axis. It''s the angle through which</span> <span m=''2331000''>you
  go through. In other words,</span> <span m=''2334000''>does number describes where
  you are on the cosine cycle.</span> </p><p><span m=''2338000''>It doesn''t tell
  you, it''s not aiming at telling you</span> <span m=''2341000''>exactly where you
  are on the t axis.</span> </p><p><span m=''2344000''>The response function looks
  like one over the square root of</span> <span m=''2349000''>one plus omega over
  k squared times cosine omega t minus phi.</span> </p><p><span m=''2359000''>And,
  I asked you on the problem set, if k goes up,</span> <span m=''2364000''>in other
  words, if the conductivity rises,</span> <span m=''2368000''>if heat can get more
  rapidly from the outside to the inside,</span> <span m=''2374000''>for example,
  how does that affect the</span> <span m=''2378000''>amplitude? This is the amplitude,</span>
  <span m=''2382000''>A, and the phase lag. In other words,</span> <span m=''2387000''>how
  does this affect the response?</span> </p><p><span m=''2391000''>And now, you can
  see. If k goes up,</span> <span m=''2395000''>this fraction is becoming smaller.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2399000''>That means the denominator is becoming smaller,</span>
  <span m=''2405000''>and therefore, the amplitude is going up.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2412000''>What''s happening to the phase lag?</span> </p><p><span m=''2414000''>Well,
  the phase lag looks like this: phi one omega over k.</span> </p><p><span m=''2420000''>If
  k is going up,</span> <span m=''2423000''>then the size of this side is going down,
  and the angle is</span> <span m=''2428000''>going down. Now, that part is intuitive.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2432000''>I would have expected everybody to get that.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2436000''>It''s the heat gets in quickly, more quickly,</span> <span m=''2440000''>then
  the amplitude will match more quickly.</span> </p><p><span m=''2444000''>This will
  rise, and get fairly close to one,</span> <span m=''2447000''>in fact, and there
  should be very little lag in the way the</span> <span m=''2453000''>response follows
  input. But how about the other one?</span> </p><p><span m=''2457000''>Okay, I give
  you two minutes. The other one,</span> <span m=''2461000''>you will figure out yourself.</span>
