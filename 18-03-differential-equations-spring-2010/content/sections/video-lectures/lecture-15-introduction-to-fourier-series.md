title: 'Lecture 15: Introduction to Fourier Series'
transcript: <p><span m='25000'>Well, let's get started.</span> </p><p><span m='38000'>The
  topic for today is --</span> <span m='58000'>Sorry. Thank you.</span> </p><p><span
  m='59000'>For today and the next two lectures, we are going to be</span> <span m='65000'>studying
  Fourier series. Today will be an introduction</span> <span m='70000'>explaining
  what they are. And, I calculate them,</span> <span m='75000'>but I thought before
  we do that I ought to least give a couple</span> <span m='81000'>minutes oversight
  of why and where we're going with them,</span> <span m='86000'>and why they're coming
  into the course at this place at all.</span> </p><p><span m='94000'>So, the situation
  up to now is that we've been trying to solve</span> <span m='99000'>equations of
  the form y double prime plus a y prime,</span> <span m='105000'>constant coefficient
  second-order equations,</span> <span m='110000'>and the f of t was the input. So,
  we are considering</span> <span m='115000'>inhomogeneous equations. This is the
  input.</span> </p><p><span m='120000'>And so far, the response, then, is the solution
  equals</span> <span m='125000'>the corresponding solution, y of t,</span> <span
  m='129000'>maybe with some given initial conditions to pick out a special</span>
  <span m='135000'>one we call the response, the response to that particular</span>
  <span m='140000'>input. And now, over the last few</span> <span m='143000'>days,
  the inputs have been, however, extremely special.</span> </p><p><span m='150000'>For
  input, the basic input has been an exponential,</span> <span m='155000'>or sines
  and cosines. And, the trouble is that we</span> <span m='159000'>learn how to solve
  those. But the point is that those</span> <span m='165000'>seem extremely special.
  Now, the point of Fourier</span> <span m='169000'>series is to show you that they
  are not as special as they look.</span> </p><p><span m='177000'>The reason is that,
  let's put it this way,</span> <span m='181000'>that any reasonable f of t which
  is periodic,</span> <span m='187000'>it doesn't have to be even very reasonable.</span>
  </p><p><span m='192000'>It can be somewhat discontinuous,</span> <span m='195000'>although
  not terribly discontinuous,</span> <span m='199000'>which is periodic with period,
  maybe not the minimal period,</span> <span m='206000'>but some period two pi. Of
  course, sine t</span> <span m='212000'>and cosine t have the exact period two pi,</span>
  <span m='216000'>but if I change the frequency to an integer frequency like</span>
  <span m='221000'>sine 2t or sine 26 t,</span> <span m='225000'>two pie would still
  be a period, although would not be</span> <span m='229000'>the period. The period
  would be shorter.</span> </p><p><span m='233000'>The point is, such a thing can
  always be</span> <span m='236000'>represented as an infinite sum of sines and cosines.</span>
  </p><p><span m='242000'>So, it's going to look like this.</span> </p><p><span m='244000'>There's
  a constant term you have to put out front.</span> </p><p><span m='247000'>And then,
  the rest, instead of writing,</span> <span m='250000'>it's rather long to write
  unless you use summation</span> <span m='254000'>notation. So, I will.</span> </p><p><span
  m='255000'>So, it's a sum from n equal one to infinity integer values of n,</span>
  <span m='260000'>in other words, of a sine and a cosine.</span> </p><p><span m='263000'>It's
  customary to put the cosine first,</span> <span m='265000'>and with the frequency,
  the n indicates the frequency</span> <span m='269000'>of the thing. And, the bn
  is sine nt.</span> </p><p><span m='275000'>Now, why does that solve the</span> <span
  m='280000'>problem of general inputs for periodic functions,</span> <span m='287000'>at
  least if the period is two pi or some fraction of it?</span> </p><p><span m='294000'>Well,
  you could think of it this way.</span> </p><p><span m='300000'>I'll make a little
  table. I'll make a little table.</span> </p><p><span m='311000'>Let's look at, let's
  put over here the input,</span> <span m='321000'>and here, I'll put the response.</span>
  </p><p><span m='330000'>Okay, suppose the input is the function sine nt.</span>
  </p><p><span m='334000'>Well, in other words, if you just solve the problem,</span>
  <span m='338000'>you put a sine nt here, you know how to get the</span> <span m='343000'>answer,
  find a particular solution, in other words.</span> </p><p><span m='347000'>In fact,
  you do it by converting this to a complex</span> <span m='351000'>exponential, and
  then all the rigmarole we've been going</span> <span m='355000'>through. So, let's
  call the response</span> <span m='358000'>something. Let's call it y.</span> </p><p><span
  m='362000'>I'd better index it by n because it, of course,</span> <span m='365000'>is
  a response to this particular periodic function.</span> </p><p><span m='369000'>So,
  n of t, and if the input is cosine nt,</span> <span m='372000'>that also will have
  a response, yn.</span> </p><p><span m='376000'>Now, I really can't call them both
  by the same name.</span> </p><p><span m='380000'>So, why don't we put a little s
  up here to indicate that that's</span> <span m='385000'>the response to the sine.
  And here, I'll put a little c</span> <span m='389000'>to indicate what the answer
  to the cosine.</span> </p><p><span m='392000'>You're feeding cosine nt, what you
  get out is</span> <span m='396000'>this function. Now what?</span> </p><p><span
  m='399000'>Well, by the way, notice that if n is zero,</span> <span m='404000'>it's
  going to take care of a constant term,</span> <span m='408000'>too. In other words,</span>
  <span m='410000'>the reason there is a constant term out front is because that</span>
  <span m='416000'>corresponds to cosine of zero t, which is one.</span> </p><p><span
  m='422000'>Now, suppose I input instead an cosine nt.</span> </p><p><span m='428000'>All
  you do is multiply the answer by an.</span> </p><p><span m='434000'>Same here. Multiply
  the input by bn.</span> </p><p><span m='436000'>You multiply the response. That's
  because the equation is</span> <span m='440000'>a linear equation. And now, what
  am I going to do?</span> </p><p><span m='444000'>I'm going to add them up. If I
  add them up from the</span> <span m='448000'>different ends and take a count also,
  the n equals zero</span> <span m='452000'>corresponding to this first constant term,</span>
  <span m='455000'>the sum of all these according to my Fourier formula is going</span>
  <span m='460000'>to be f of t. What's the sum of this,</span> <span m='465000'>the
  corresponding responses? Well, that's going to be</span> <span m='470000'>summation
  a n y n c t plus b n y n,</span> <span m='476000'>the response to the sine.</span>
  </p><p><span m='479000'>That will be the sum from one to infinity, and there will
  be</span> <span m='485000'>some sort of constant term here. Let's just call it c1.</span>
  </p><p><span m='490000'>So, in other words, if this input produces that</span> <span
  m='494000'>response, and these are things which we can calculate,</span> <span m='498000'>we're
  led by this formula, Fourier's formula,</span> <span m='502000'>to the response
  to things which otherwise we would have not been</span> <span m='507000'>able to
  calculate, namely, any periodic function</span> <span m='511000'>of period two pi
  will have, the procedure will be,</span> <span m='515000'>you've got a periodic
  function of period two pi.</span> </p><p><span m='520000'>Find its Fourier series,
  and I'll show you how to do</span> <span m='523000'>that today. Find its Fourier
  series,</span> <span m='526000'>and then the response to that general f of t will
  be this</span> <span m='530000'>infinite series of functions, where these things
  are things</span> <span m='535000'>you already know how to calculate.</span> </p><p><span
  m='537000'>They are the responses to sines and cosines.</span> </p><p><span m='542000'>And,
  you just formed the sum with those coefficients.</span> </p><p><span m='546000'>Now,
  why does that work? It works by the superposition</span> <span m='550000'>principle.
  So, this is true.</span> </p><p><span m='553000'>The reason I can do the adding
  and multiplying by constant,</span> <span m='557000'>I'm using the superposition
  principle.</span> </p><p><span m='561000'>If this input produces that response,
  then the sum of a</span> <span m='565000'>bunch of inputs produces the sum of the
  corresponding responses.</span> </p><p><span m='572000'>And, why is that? Why can
  I use the superposition</span> <span m='578000'>principle? Because the ODE is linear.</span>
  </p><p><span m='583000'>It's okay, since the ODE is linear.</span> </p><p><span
  m='587000'>That's what makes all this work.</span> </p><p><span m='591000'>Now,
  so what we're going to do today is I will show you how to</span> <span m='599000'>calculate
  those Fourier series. I will not be able to use it to</span> <span m='607000'>actually
  solve any differential equation.</span> </p><p><span m='609000'>It will take us
  pretty much all the period to show how to</span> <span m='613000'>calculate a Fourier
  series. And, okay, so I'm going to</span> <span m='617000'>solve differential equations
  on Monday.</span> </p><p><span m='619000'>Wrong. I probably won't even get to it</span>
  <span m='622000'>then because the calculation of a Fourier series is a sufficient</span>
  <span m='626000'>amount of work that you really want to know all the possible</span>
  <span m='630000'>tricks and shortcuts there are. Unfortunately,</span> <span m='635000'>they
  are not very clever tricks.</span> </p><p><span m='637000'>They are just obvious
  things. But, it will take me a period</span> <span m='641000'>to point out those
  obvious things, obvious in my sense if</span> <span m='645000'>not in yours. And,
  finally,</span> <span m='647000'>the third day, we'll solve differential</span>
  <span m='650000'>equations. I will actually carry out the</span> <span m='653000'>program.
  But the main thing we're going</span> <span m='656000'>to get out of it is another
  approach to resonance because</span> <span m='660000'>the things that we are going
  to be interested in are picking out</span> <span m='665000'>which of these terms
  may possibly produce resonance,</span> <span m='668000'>and therefore a very crazy
  response.</span> </p><p><span m='673000'>Some of the terms in the response suddenly
  get a much</span> <span m='676000'>bigger amplitude than this than you would normally
  have thought</span> <span m='681000'>they had because it's picking out resonant
  terms in the</span> <span m='684000'>Fourier series of the input. Okay, well, that's
  a big</span> <span m='688000'>mouthfu. Let's get started on</span> <span m='690000'>calculating.
  So, the program today is</span> <span m='693000'>calculate the Fourier series. Given
  f of t periodic,</span> <span m='700000'>having two pi as a period, find its Fourier
  series.</span> </p><p><span m='707000'>How, in other words, do I calculate those</span>
  <span m='712000'>coefficients, an and bn.</span> </p><p><span m='717000'>Now, the
  answer is not immediately apparent,</span> <span m='720000'>and it's really quite
  remarkable.</span> </p><p><span m='723000'>I think it's quite remarkable, anyway.</span>
  </p><p><span m='725000'>It's one of the basic things of higher mathematics.</span>
  </p><p><span m='730000'>And, what it depends upon are certain things called the</span>
  <span m='734000'>orthogonality relations. So, this is the place where</span> <span
  m='738000'>you've got to learn what such things are.</span> </p><p><span m='741000'>Well,
  I think it would be a good idea to have a general</span> <span m='745000'>definition,
  rather than immediately get into the</span> <span m='749000'>specifics. So, I'm
  going to call u of x,</span> <span m='754000'>u of t, I think I will use,</span>
  <span m='759000'>since Fourier analysis is most often applied when the variable</span>
  <span m='765000'>is time, I think I will stick to independent variable t all</span>
  <span m='771000'>period long, if I remember to, at any rate.</span> </p><p><span
  m='776000'>So, these are two continuous, or not very discontinuous</span> <span
  m='781000'>functions on minus pi. Let's make them periodic.</span> </p><p><span
  m='787000'>Let's say two pi is a period. So, functions,</span> <span m='792000'>for
  example like those guys, sine t, sine nt,</span> <span m='796000'>sine 22t,</span>
  <span m='800000'>and so on, say two pi is a period.</span> </p><p><span m='803000'>Well,
  I want them really on the whole real axis,</span> <span m='808000'>not there. Define
  for all real numbers.</span> </p><p><span m='814000'>Then, I say that they are orthogonal,
  perpendicular.</span> </p><p><span m='819000'>But nobody says perpendicular. Orthogonal
  is the word,</span> <span m='824000'>orthogonal on the interval minus pi to pi</span>
  <span m='829000'>if the integral, so, two are orthogonal.</span> </p><p><span m='834000'>Well,
  these two functions, if the integral from minus pi</span> <span m='840000'>to pi
  of u of t v of t, the product is zero,</span> <span m='846000'>that's called the
  orthogonality condition on minus pi to pi.</span> </p><p><span m='852000'>Now, well,
  it's just the</span> <span m='856000'>definition. I would love to go into a</span>
  <span m='859000'>little song and dance now on what the definition really</span>
  <span m='863000'>means, and what its application, why the word orthogonal is</span>
  <span m='867000'>used, because it really does have something to do with two</span>
  <span m='871000'>vectors being orthogonal in the sense in which you live it in</span>
  <span m='875000'>18.02. I'll have to put that on the</span> <span m='879000'>ice
  for the moment, and whether I get to it or not</span> <span m='883000'>depends on
  how fast I talk. But, you probably prefer I talk</span> <span m='888000'>slowly.
  So, let's compromise.</span> </p><p><span m='890000'>Anyway, that's the condition.
  And now, what I say is that</span> <span m='895000'>that Fourier, that blue Fourier
  series,</span> <span m='898000'>-- -- what finding the</span> <span m='901000'>coefficients
  an and bn depends upon is this theorem that the</span> <span m='906000'>collection
  of functions, as I look at this collection of</span> <span m='911000'>functions,
  sine nt for any value of the integer,</span> <span m='916000'>n, of course I can
  assume n is a positive integer because sine</span> <span m='921000'>of minus nt
  is the same as sine of nt.</span> </p><p><span m='926000'>And, cosine mt, let's
  give it a different,</span> <span m='930000'>so I don't want you to think they are
  exactly the same</span> <span m='934000'>integers. So, this is a big collection
  of</span> <span m='940000'>functions, as n runs from one to infinity-- Here,</span>
  <span m='945000'>I could let m be run from zero to infinity because cosine of</span>
  <span m='951000'>zero t means something.</span> </p><p><span m='954000'>It's a constant,
  one-- that any two distinct</span> <span m='959000'>ones, two distinct, you know,
  how can two things be</span> <span m='964000'>not different? Well, you know,</span>
  <span m='968000'>you talk about two coincident roots.</span> </p><p><span m='972000'>I'm
  just killing, doing a little overkill.</span> </p><p><span m='976000'>Any two distinct
  ones of these, two distinct members of the set</span> <span m='982000'>of this collection
  of, I don't know,</span> <span m='985000'>there's no way to say that, any two distinct
  ones are</span> <span m='991000'>orthogonal on this interval. Of course, they all
  have two pi</span> <span m='996000'>as a period for all of them. So, they form into
  this general</span> <span m='1003000'>category that I'm talking about, but any two
  distinct ones are</span> <span m='1007000'>orthogonal on the interval for minus
  pi to pi.</span> </p><p><span m='1011000'>So, if I integrate from minus</span> <span
  m='1013000'>pi to pi sine of three t times cosine of four t dt,</span> <span m='1017000'>answer
  is zero.</span> </p><p><span m='1020000'>If I integrate sine of 3t times</span>
  <span m='1025000'>the sine of 60t, answer is zero.</span> </p><p><span m='1029000'>The
  same thing with two cosines, or a sine and a cosine.</span> </p><p><span m='1033000'>The
  only time you don't get zero is if you integrate,</span> <span m='1037000'>if you
  make the two functions the same.</span> </p><p><span m='1040000'>Now, how do you
  know that you could not possibly get the</span> <span m='1045000'>answer is zero
  if the two functions are the same?</span> </p><p><span m='1050000'>If the two functions
  are the same, then I'm integrating a</span> <span m='1055000'>square. A square is
  always positive.</span> </p><p><span m='1058000'>I'm integrating a square. A square
  is always positive,</span> <span m='1063000'>and therefore I cannot get the answer,
  zero.</span> </p><p><span m='1067000'>But, in the other cases, I might get the answer
  zero.</span> </p><p><span m='1071000'>And the theorem is you always do.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1074000'>Okay, so, why is this? Well, there are three ways to</span> <span m='1080000'>prove
  this. It's like many fundamental</span> <span m='1083000'>facts in mathematics.
  There are different ways of</span> <span m='1087000'>going about it. By the way,
  along with the</span> <span m='1090000'>theorem, I probably should have included,
  so,</span> <span m='1094000'>I'm far away. But you might as well include,</span>
  <span m='1098000'>because we're going to need it. What happens if you use the</span>
  <span m='1103000'>same function? If I take U equal to V,</span> <span m='1106000'>and
  in that case, as I've indicated,</span> <span m='1109000'>you're not going to get
  the answer, zero.</span> </p><p><span m='1114000'>But, what you will get is, so,
  in other words,</span> <span m='1117000'>I'm just asking, what is the sine of</span>
  <span m='1121000'>n t squared. That's a case where two of them</span> <span m='1124000'>are
  the same. I use the same function.</span> </p><p><span m='1127000'>What's that?
  Well, the answer is,</span> <span m='1130000'>it's the same as what you will get
  if you integrate the cosine,</span> <span m='1134000'>cosine squared n t dt.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1138000'>And, the answer to either one</span> <span m='1142000'>of
  these is pi. That's something you know how</span> <span m='1146000'>to do from 18.01
  or the equivalent thereof.</span> </p><p><span m='1149000'>You can integrate sine
  squared. It's one of the things you had</span> <span m='1154000'>to learn for whatever
  exam you took on methods of integration.</span> </p><p><span m='1159000'>Anyway,
  so I'm not going to calculate this out.</span> </p><p><span m='1163000'>The answer
  turns out to be pi. All right, now,</span> <span m='1167000'>the ways to prove it
  are you can use trig identities.</span> </p><p><span m='1173000'>And, I'm asking
  you in one of the early problems in the</span> <span m='1177000'>problem set, identities,
  identities for the product of</span> <span m='1181000'>sine and cosine, expressing
  it in a form in</span> <span m='1184000'>which it's easy to integrate, and you can
  prove it that way.</span> </p><p><span m='1188000'>Or, you can use, if you have
  forgotten the</span> <span m='1191000'>trigonometric identities and want to get
  some more exercise</span> <span m='1196000'>with complex-- you can use complex exponentials.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1201000'>So, I'm asking you how to, in another part of the same</span>
  <span m='1205000'>problem I'm asking you how to do it, do one of these,</span> <span
  m='1209000'>at any rate, using complex exponentials.</span> </p><p><span m='1213000'>And
  now, I'm going to use a mysterious third method another</span> <span m='1218000'>way.
  I'm going to use the ODE.</span> </p><p><span m='1220000'>I'm going to do that because
  this is the method.</span> </p><p><span m='1224000'>It's not just sines and cosines
  which are orthogonal.</span> </p><p><span m='1230000'>There are masses of orthogonal
  functions out there.</span> </p><p><span m='1233000'>And, the way they are discovered,
  and the way you</span> <span m='1236000'>prove they're orthogonal is not with trig
  identities and complex</span> <span m='1240000'>exponentials because those only
  work with sines and cosines.</span> </p><p><span m='1244000'>It is, instead, by
  going back to the</span> <span m='1246000'>differential equation that they solve.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1248000'>And that's, therefore, the method here that I'm going</span>
  <span m='1252000'>to use here because this is the method which generalizes to many</span>
  <span m='1256000'>other differential equations other than the simple ones</span>
  <span m='1259000'>satisfied by sines and cosines. But anyway, that is the source.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1265000'>So, the way the proof of these orthogonality conditions
  goes,</span> <span m='1269000'>so I'm not going to do that. And, I'm going to assume
  that m</span> <span m='1274000'>is different from n so that I'm not in either of
  these two</span> <span m='1278000'>cases. What it depends on is,</span> <span m='1280000'>what's
  the differential equation that all these</span> <span m='1283000'>functions satisfy?
  Well, it's a different</span> <span m='1286000'>differential equation depending
  upon the value of n,</span> <span m='1290000'>-- -- but they look at essentially</span>
  <span m='1295000'>the same. These satisfy the differential</span> <span m='1298000'>equation,
  in other words, what they have in common.</span> </p><p><span m='1303000'>The differential
  equation is, let's call it u.</span> </p><p><span m='1308000'>It looks better. It's
  going to look better if</span> <span m='1312000'>you let me call it u. u double
  prime plus,</span> <span m='1316000'>well, n squared, so for the function sine n
  t</span> <span m='1320000'>cosine n t, satisfy u double</span> <span m='1325000'>prime
  plus n squared times u.</span> </p><p><span m='1331000'>In other words, the frequency
  is n,</span> <span m='1333000'>and therefore, this is a square of the</span> <span
  m='1336000'>frequency is what you put here, equals zero.</span> </p><p><span m='1339000'>In
  other words, what these functions have in</span> <span m='1342000'>common is that
  they satisfy differential equations that look</span> <span m='1346000'>like that.
  And the only thing that's</span> <span m='1348000'>allowed to vary is the frequency,
  which is allowed to</span> <span m='1352000'>change. The frequency is in this</span>
  <span m='1356000'>coefficient of u. Now, the remarkable thing is</span> <span m='1362000'>that's
  all you need to know. The fact that they satisfy the</span> <span m='1369000'>differential
  equation, that's all you need to know to</span> <span m='1375000'>prove the orthogonality
  relationship.</span> </p><p><span m='1379000'>Okay, let's try to do it. Well, I
  need some notation.</span> </p><p><span m='1386000'>So, I'm going to let un and
  vm be any two of the functions.</span> </p><p><span m='1391000'>In other words,
  I'll assume m is different from</span> <span m='1396000'>n. For example,</span>
  <span m='1397000'>this one could be sine nt, and that could be</span> <span m='1402000'>sine
  of mt, or this could be sine nt</span> <span m='1406000'>and that could be cosine
  of mt.</span> </p><p><span m='1413000'>You get the idea. Any two of those in the</span>
  <span m='1415000'>subscript indicates whether what the n or the m is that are in</span>
  <span m='1420000'>that. Any two, and I mean really two,</span> <span m='1422000'>distinct,
  well, if I say that m is not n,</span> <span m='1425000'>then they positively have
  to be different.</span> </p><p><span m='1428000'>So, again, it's overkill with my
  two's-ness.</span> </p><p><span m='1431000'>And, what I'm going to calculate, well,</span>
  <span m='1433000'>first of all, from the equation,</span> <span m='1436000'>I'm
  going to write the equation this way.</span> </p><p><span m='1440000'>It says that
  u double prime is equal to minus n squared u.</span> </p><p><span m='1447000'>That's
  true for any of these</span> <span m='1451000'>guys. Of course, here,</span> <span
  m='1453000'>it would be v double prime is equal to minus m squared</span> <span
  m='1460000'>times v. You have to make those simple</span> <span m='1466000'>adjustments.
  And now, what we're going to</span> <span m='1470000'>calculate is the integral
  from minus pi to pi of un double</span> <span m='1477000'>prime times vm dt.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1483000'>Now, just bear with me.</span> </p><p><span m='1488000'>Why
  am I going to do that? I can't explain what I'm going</span> <span m='1493000'>to
  do that. But you won't ask me the</span> <span m='1496000'>question in five minutes.
  But the point is,</span> <span m='1499000'>this is highly un-symmetric. The u is
  differentiated twice.</span> </p><p><span m='1505000'>The v isn't. So, those two
  functions-- but</span> <span m='1508000'>there is a way of turning them into an
  expression which looks</span> <span m='1512000'>extremely symmetric, where they
  are the same.</span> </p><p><span m='1516000'>And the way to do that is I want to
  get rid of one of these</span> <span m='1520000'>primes here and put one on here.
  The way to do that is if you</span> <span m='1525000'>want to integrate one of these
  guys, and differentiate this one</span> <span m='1529000'>to make them look the
  same, that's called integration by</span> <span m='1533000'>parts, the most important
  theoretical method you learned</span> <span m='1538000'>in 18.01 even though you
  didn't know that it was the most</span> <span m='1542000'>important theoretical
  method. Okay, we're going to use it now</span> <span m='1547000'>as a basis for
  Fourier series. Okay, so I'm going to integrate</span> <span m='1551000'>by parts.
  Now, the first thing you do,</span> <span m='1553000'>of course, when you integrate
  by parts is you just do the</span> <span m='1556000'>integration. You don't do differentiation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1559000'>So, the first thing looks like this.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1562000'>And, that's to be evaluated between negative pi and pi.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1568000'>In doing integration by parts between limits,</span> <span m='1572000'>minus
  what you get by doing both.</span> </p><p><span m='1576000'>You do both, the integration
  and the</span> <span m='1580000'>differentiation. And, again, evaluate that</span>
  <span m='1584000'>between limits. Now, I'm just going to BS my</span> <span m='1589000'>way
  through this. This is zero.</span> </p><p><span m='1594000'>I don't care what the
  un's, which un you picked and which</span> <span m='1599000'>vm you picked. The
  answer here is always going</span> <span m='1603000'>to be zero. Instead of wasting
  six boards</span> <span m='1606000'>trying to write out the argument, let me wave
  my hands.</span> </p><p><span m='1611000'>Okay, it's clear, for example,</span>
  <span m='1614000'>that a v is a sine, sine mt.</span> </p><p><span m='1617000'>Of
  course it's zero because the sine vanishes at both pi and</span> <span m='1622000'>minus
  pi. If the un were a cosine,</span> <span m='1626000'>after I differentiate it,
  it became a sine.</span> </p><p><span m='1629000'>And so, now it's this side guy
  that's zero at both ends.</span> </p><p><span m='1634000'>So, the only case in which
  we might have a little doubt is if</span> <span m='1638000'>this is a cosine, and
  after differentiation,</span> <span m='1641000'>this is also a cosine. In other
  words,</span> <span m='1644000'>it might look like cosine, after, this cosine nt
  times</span> <span m='1648000'>cosine mt. But, I claim that that's zero,</span>
  <span m='1654000'>too. Why?</span> </p><p><span m='1655000'>Because the cosines
  are even functions, and therefore,</span> <span m='1659000'>they have the same value
  at both ends.</span> </p><p><span m='1662000'>So, if I subtract the value evaluated
  at pi,</span> <span m='1666000'>and subtract the value of minus pi, again zero because
  I have</span> <span m='1671000'>the same value at both ends. So, by this entirely
  convincing</span> <span m='1676000'>argument, no matter what combination of sines
  and cosines</span> <span m='1680000'>I have here, the answer to that part will always
  be zero.</span> </p><p><span m='1687000'>So, by calculation, but thought calculation;</span>
  <span m='1691000'>it's just a waste of time to write anything out.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1696000'>You stare at it until you agree that it's so.</span> </p><p><span m='1700000'>And
  now, I've taken, by this integration by parts,</span> <span m='1705000'>I've taken
  this highly un-symmetric expression and</span> <span m='1710000'>turned it into
  something in which the u and the v are</span> <span m='1715000'>treated exactly
  alike. Well, good, that's nice,</span> <span m='1720000'>but why? Why did I go to
  this trouble?</span> </p><p><span m='1723000'>Okay, now we're going to use the fact
  that this satisfies the</span> <span m='1727000'>differential equation, in other
  words,</span> <span m='1730000'>that u double prime is equal to minus n,</span>
  <span m='1733000'>I'm sorry, I should have subscripted this.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1736000'>If that's the solution, then this is equal to,</span> <span m='1740000'>times.
  You have to put in a subscript</span> <span m='1742000'>otherwise. The n wouldn't
  matter.</span> </p><p><span m='1746000'>All right, I'm now going to take that expression,</span>
  <span m='1750000'>and evaluate it differently. un double prime vm dt</span> <span
  m='1755000'>is equal to, well, un double prime,</span> <span m='1758000'>because
  it satisfies the differential equation is equal</span> <span m='1762000'>to that.
  So, what is this?</span> </p><p><span m='1765000'>This is minus n squared times
  the integral from</span> <span m='1769000'>negative pi to pi, and I'm replacing
  un double</span> <span m='1773000'>prime by minus n squared un.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1779000'>I pulled the minus n squared out.</span> </p><p><span m='1783000'>So,
  it's un here, and the other factor is vm dt.</span> </p><p><span m='1787000'>Now,
  that's the proof. Huh?</span> </p><p><span m='1790000'>What do you mean that's the
  proof?</span> </p><p><span m='1794000'>Okay, well, I'll first state it, why intuitively
  that's the</span> <span m='1799000'>end of the argument. And then, I'll spell it
  out a</span> <span m='1806000'>little more detail, but the more detail you make</span>
  <span m='1811000'>for this, the more obscure it gets instead of,</span> <span m='1816000'>look,
  I just showed you that this is symmetric in u and v,</span> <span m='1822000'>after
  you massage it a little bit.</span> </p><p><span m='1826000'>Here, I'm calculating
  it a different way.</span> </p><p><span m='1830000'>Is this symmetric in u and v?
  Well, the answer is yes or no.</span> </p><p><span m='1837000'>Is this symmetric
  at u and v? No.</span> </p><p><span m='1840000'>Why? Because of the n.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1842000'>The n favors u. We have what is called a</span> <span m='1846000'>paradox.
  This thing is symmetric in u</span> <span m='1850000'>and v because I can show it
  is. And, it's not symmetric in u</span> <span m='1855000'>and v because I can show
  it is. I can show it's not symmetric</span> <span m='1861000'>because it favors
  the n. Now, there's only one possible</span> <span m='1869000'>resolution of that
  paradox. Both would be symmetric if what</span> <span m='1879000'>were true? Pardon?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1882000'>Negative pi. All right, let me write it this</span> <span
  m='1889000'>way. Okay, never mind.</span> </p><p><span m='1892000'>You see, the
  only way this can happen is if this expression is</span> <span m='1897000'>zero.
  In other words,</span> <span m='1899000'>the only way something can be both symmetric
  and not symmetric</span> <span m='1904000'>is if it's zero all the time. And, that's
  what we're trying</span> <span m='1908000'>to prove, that this is zero. But, instead
  of doing it that</span> <span m='1913000'>way, let me show you. This is equal to
  that,</span> <span m='1917000'>and therefore, two things according to Euclid,</span>
  <span m='1920000'>two things equal to the same thing are equal to each other.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1927000'>So, this equals that, which, in turn,</span> <span m='1929000'>therefore,
  equals what I would have gotten.</span> </p><p><span m='1932000'>I'm just saying
  the symmetry of different way,</span> <span m='1935000'>what I would have gotten
  if I had done this calculation.</span> </p><p><span m='1939000'>And, that turns
  out to be minus m squared times the integral</span> <span m='1943000'>from minus
  pi to pi of un vm dt.</span> </p><p><span m='1948000'>So, these two are equal because</span>
  <span m='1953000'>they are both equal to this. This is equal to that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1958000'>This equals that. Therefore, how can this equal</span> <span m='1962000'>that
  unless the integral is zero?</span> </p><p><span m='1966000'>How's that? Remember,
  m is different from</span> <span m='1970000'>n. So, what this proves is,</span>
  <span m='1972000'>therefore, the integral from negative pi to pi of un vm dt is</span>
  <span m='1979000'>equal to zero,</span> <span m='1985000'>at least if m is different
  from n.</span> </p><p><span m='1990000'>Now, there is one case I didn't include.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1992000'>Which case didn't I include? un times un is not supposed
  to</span> <span m='1996000'>be zero. So, in that case,</span> <span m='1998000'>I
  don't have to worry about, but there is a case that I</span> <span m='2002000'>didn't.
  For example,</span> <span m='2004000'>something like the cosine of nt times the
  sine of nt.</span> </p><p><span m='2008000'>Here, the m is the same as the</span>
  <span m='2012000'>n. Nonetheless,</span> <span m='2014000'>I am claiming that this
  is zero because these aren't the same</span> <span m='2019000'>function. One is
  a cosine.</span> </p><p><span m='2022000'>Why is that zero? Can you see mentally
  that</span> <span m='2026000'>that's zero? Mentally?</span> </p><p><span m='2028000'>Well,
  this is trying to be in another life,</span> <span m='2032000'>it's trying to be
  one half the sine of two nt, right?</span> </p><p><span m='2037000'>And obviously
  the integral of</span> <span m='2042000'>sine of two nt is zero between minus pi
  and pi</span> <span m='2046000'>because you integrate it,</span> <span m='2049000'>and
  it turns out to be zero. You integrate it to a cosine,</span> <span m='2053000'>which
  has the same value of both ends.</span> </p><p><span m='2056000'>Well, that was
  a lot of talking.</span> </p><p><span m='2058000'>If this proof is too abstract
  for you, I won't ask you to</span> <span m='2062000'>reproduce it on an exam. You
  can go with the proofs</span> <span m='2065000'>using trigonometric identities,
  and/or complex exponentials.</span> </p><p><span m='2071000'>But, you ought to know
  at least one of those,</span> <span m='2074000'>and for the problem set I'm asking
  you to fool around a</span> <span m='2079000'>little with at least two of them.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2081000'>Okay, now, what has this got to do with the problem we
  started</span> <span m='2087000'>with originally? The problem is to explain this</span>
  <span m='2090000'>blue series. So, our problem is,</span> <span m='2093000'>how,
  from this, am I going to get the terms of</span> <span m='2097000'>this blue series?
  So, given f of t,</span> <span m='2102000'>two pi s a period. Find the an and the
  bn.</span> </p><p><span m='2106000'>Okay, let's focus on the an. The bn is the same.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2111000'>Once you know how to do one, you know how to do the other.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2116000'>So, here's the idea. Again, it goes back to the</span>
  <span m='2121000'>something you learned at the very beginning of 18.02,</span> <span
  m='2126000'>but I don't think it took. But maybe some of you will</span> <span m='2132000'>recognize
  it. So, what I'm going to do is</span> <span m='2136000'>write it. Here's the term
  we're looking</span> <span m='2140000'>for here, this one. Okay, and there are others.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2145000'>It's an infinite series that goes on forever.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2150000'>And now, to make the argument, I've got to put it one more</span> <span
  m='2156000'>term here. So, I'm going to put in ak</span> <span m='2160000'>cosine
  kt. I don't mean to imply that that</span> <span m='2167000'>k could be more than
  n, in which case I should have</span> <span m='2171000'>written it here. I could
  have also used equally</span> <span m='2176000'>well bk sine kt here, and I could
  have put it</span> <span m='2182000'>there. This is just some other term.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2185000'>This is the an, and this is the one we want.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2190000'>And, this is some other term. Okay, all right,</span> <span m='2195000'>now,
  what you do is, to get the an,</span> <span m='2198000'>what you do is you multiply
  everything through by,</span> <span m='2202000'>you focus on the one you want, so
  it's dot,</span> <span m='2206000'>dot, dot, dot, dot, and you multiply by cosine</span>
  <span m='2210000'>nt. So, it's ak cosine kt times</span> <span m='2214000'>cosine
  nt.</span> </p><p><span m='2217000'>Of course, that gets multiplied, too.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2222000'>But, the one we want also gets multiplied, an.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2226000'>And, it becomes, when I multiply by cosine nt,</span> <span m='2231000'>cosine
  squared nt,</span> <span m='2236000'>and now, I hope you can see what's going to
  happen.</span> </p><p><span m='2241000'>Now, oops, I didn't multiply the f of t,</span>
  <span m='2246000'>sorry. It's the oldest trick in the</span> <span m='2250000'>book.
  I now integrate everything from</span> <span m='2255000'>minus, so I don't endlessly
  recopy.</span> </p><p><span m='2258000'>I'll integrate by putting it up in yellow
  chalk,</span> <span m='2262000'>and you are left to your own devices.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2266000'>This is definitely a colored pen type of course.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2270000'>Okay, so, you want to integrate from minus pi to pi?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2275000'>Good. Just integrate everything on</span> <span m='2279000'>the right
  hand side, also, from minus pi to pi.</span> </p><p><span m='2285000'>Plus, these
  are the guys just to indicate that I haven't,</span> <span m='2290000'>they are
  out there, too.</span> </p><p><span m='2293000'>And now, what happens? What's this?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2296000'>Zero. Every term is zero because of</span> <span m='2300000'>the
  orthogonality relations. They are all of the form,</span> <span m='2305000'>a constant
  times cosine nt times something different from</span> <span m='2311000'>cosine nt,
  sine kt,</span> <span m='2315000'>cosine kt, or even that constant term.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2322000'>All of the other terms are zero, and the only one which</span>
  <span m='2326000'>survives is this one. And, what's its value?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2330000'>The integral from minus pi to pi of cosine squared,</span> <span m='2334000'>I
  put that up somewhere. It's right here,</span> <span m='2337000'>down there? It
  is pi.</span> </p><p><span m='2340000'>So, this term turns into an pi, an, dragged
  along,</span> <span m='2344000'>but this, the integral of the square of the cosine
  turns out</span> <span m='2350000'>to be pi. And so, the end result is that</span>
  <span m='2354000'>we get a formula for an. What is an?</span> </p><p><span m='2358000'>an
  is, well, an times pi,</span> <span m='2360000'>all these terms of zero, and nothing
  is left but this</span> <span m='2365000'>left-hand side. And therefore,</span>
  <span m='2368000'>an times pi is the integral from negative pi to pi of f of t</span>
  <span m='2374000'>times cosine nt dt.</span> </p><p><span m='2380000'>But, that's
  an times pi.</span> </p><p><span m='2385000'>Therefore, if I want just an, I have
  to divide it by pi.</span> </p><p><span m='2390000'>And, that's the formula for
  the coefficient an.</span> </p><p><span m='2394000'>The argument is exactly the
  same if you want bn,</span> <span m='2397000'>but I will write it down for the sake
  of completeness,</span> <span m='2402000'>as they say, and to give you a chance
  to</span> <span m='2405000'>digest what I've done, you know, 30 seconds to digest</span>
  <span m='2409000'>it. Sine nt dt.</span> </p><p><span m='2412000'>And, that's because
  the argument is the same.</span> </p><p><span m='2416000'>And, the integral of sine
  squared nt is also</span> <span m='2420000'>pi. So, there's no difference</span>
  <span m='2422000'>there. Now, there's only one little</span> <span m='2424000'>caution.
  It have to be a little careful.</span> </p><p><span m='2427000'>This is n one, two,
  and so on,</span> <span m='2429000'>and this is also n one, two, and unfortunately,</span>
  <span m='2433000'>the constant term is a slight exception.</span> </p><p><span m='2435000'>We
  better look at that specifically because if you</span> <span m='2439000'>forget
  it, you can get them to gross, gross,</span> <span m='2442000'>gross errors. How
  about the constant term?</span> </p><p><span m='2448000'>Suppose I repeat the argument
  for that in miniature.</span> </p><p><span m='2454000'>There is a constant term
  plus other stuff, a typical other</span> <span m='2461000'>stuff, an cosine, let's
  say.</span> </p><p><span m='2466000'>How am I going to get that constant term?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2470000'>Well, if you think of this as sort of like a constant times,</span>
  <span m='2476000'>the reason is the constant is because it's being multiplied by</span>
  <span m='2482000'>cosine zero t. So, that suggests I should</span> <span m='2487000'>multiply
  by one. In other words,</span> <span m='2491000'>what I should do is simply integrate
  this from negative pi</span> <span m='2496000'>to pi, f of t dt.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2500000'>What's the answer? Well, this integrated from</span> <span m='2504000'>minus
  pi to pi is how much? It's c zero times two pi,</span> <span m='2509000'>right?
  And, the other terms all give</span> <span m='2512000'>me zero. Every other term
  is zero</span> <span m='2515000'>because if you integrate cosine nt or sine nt</span>
  <span m='2520000'>over a complete period, you always get zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2526000'>There is as much area above the axis or below.</span> </p><p><span m='2530000'>Or,
  you can look at two special cases.</span> </p><p><span m='2533000'>Anyway, you always
  get zero. It's the same thing with sine</span> <span m='2538000'>here. So, the answer
  is that c zero</span> <span m='2541000'>is equal to, is a little special.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2544000'>You don't just put n equals zero here because then</span>
  <span m='2550000'>you would lose a factor of two. So, c zero should be one</span>
  <span m='2556000'>over two pi times this integral.</span> </p><p><span m='2560000'>Now,
  there are two kinds of people in the world,</span> <span m='2564000'>the ones who
  learn two separate formulas, and the ones who just</span> <span m='2570000'>learn
  two separate notations. So, what most people do is they</span> <span m='2575000'>say,
  look, I want this to be always the formula for a zero.</span> </p><p><span m='2582000'>That
  means, even when n is zero, I want this to be the</span> <span m='2587000'>formula.
  Well, then you are not going to</span> <span m='2590000'>get the right leading term.
  Instead of getting c zero,</span> <span m='2594000'>you're going to get twice it,
  and therefore,</span> <span m='2598000'>the formula is, the Fourier series,</span>
  <span m='2601000'>therefore, isn't written this way.</span> </p><p><span m='2604000'>It's
  written-- If you want an a zero there,</span> <span m='2608000'>calculate it by
  this formula. Then, you've got to write not c</span> <span m='2614000'>zero, but
  a zero over two.</span> </p><p><span m='2617000'>I think you will be happiest if
  I have to give you advice.</span> </p><p><span m='2621000'>I think you'll be happiest
  remembering a single formula for</span> <span m='2625000'>the an's and bn's, in
  which case you have to</span> <span m='2628000'>remember that the constant leading
  term is a zero over two</span> <span m='2632000'>if you insist on using that formula.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2635000'>Otherwise, you have to learn a special formula for the
  leading</span> <span m='2639000'>coefficient, namely one over two pi instead of
  one</span> <span m='2643000'>over pi. Well, am I really going to</span> <span m='2648000'>calculate
  a Fourier series in four minutes?</span> </p><p><span m='2651000'>Not very likely,
  but I'll give it a brave</span> <span m='2654000'>college try. Anyway, you will
  be doing a</span> <span m='2657000'>great deal of it, and your book has lots and
  lots</span> <span m='2661000'>of examples, too many, in fact.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2663000'>It ruined all the good examples by calculating them for you.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2668000'>But, I will at least outline. Do you want me to spend three</span>
  <span m='2674000'>minutes outlining a calculation just so you have something to</span>
  <span m='2678000'>work on in the next boring class you are in?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2682000'>Let's see, so I'll just put a few key things on the board.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2686000'>I would advise you to sit still for this.</span> </p><p><span m='2689000'>Otherwise
  you're going to hack it, and take twice as long as</span> <span m='2694000'>you
  should, even though I knew you've been up to 3:00 in the</span> <span m='2698000'>morning
  doing your problem set. Cheer up.</span> </p><p><span m='2703000'>I got up at 6:00
  to make up the new one.</span> </p><p><span m='2708000'>So, we're even. This should
  be zero here.</span> </p><p><span m='2713000'>So, here's minus pi. Here's pi.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2717000'>Here's one, negative one. The function starts out like</span>
  <span m='2724000'>that, and now to be periodic, it then has to continue on in</span>
  <span m='2731000'>the same way. So, I think that's enough of</span> <span m='2737000'>its
  path through life to indicate how it runs.</span> </p><p><span m='2742000'>This
  is a typical square-away function, sometimes it's called.</span> </p><p><span m='2748000'>It's
  an odd function. It goes equally above and below</span> <span m='2753000'>the axis.
  Now, the integrals,</span> <span m='2756000'>when you calculate them, the an is
  going to be,</span> <span m='2760000'>okay, look, the an is going to turn out to
  be zero.</span> </p><p><span m='2768000'>Let me, instead, and you will get that
  with a</span> <span m='2771000'>little hacking. I'm much more worried about</span>
  <span m='2774000'>what you'll do with the bn's. Also, next Monday you'll see</span>
  <span m='2777000'>intuitively that the an is zero, in which case you won't even</span>
  <span m='2782000'>bother trying to calculate it. How about the bn,</span> <span
  m='2785000'>though? Well, you see,</span> <span m='2786000'>because the function
  is discontinuous,</span> <span m='2789000'>so, this is my input. My f of t is that</span>
  <span m='2792000'>orange discontinuous function. The bn is going to be,</span> <span
  m='2797000'>I have to break it into two parts.</span> </p><p><span m='2800000'>In
  the first part, the function is negative one.</span> </p><p><span m='2803000'>And
  there, I will be integrating from minus pi to pi</span> <span m='2807000'>of the
  function, which is minus one times the</span> <span m='2810000'>sine of nt dt.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2814000'>And then, there's another part,</span> <span m='2817000'>sorry,
  minus pi to zero. The other part I integrate from</span> <span m='2822000'>zero
  to pi of what? Well, f of t is now plus one.</span> </p><p><span m='2826000'>And
  so, I simply integrate sine</span> <span m='2830000'>nt dt. Now, each of these is
  a</span> <span m='2834000'>perfectly simple integral. The only question is how you</span>
  <span m='2839000'>combine them. So, this is,</span> <span m='2841000'>after you
  calculate it, it will be (one minus cosine n</span> <span m='2846000'>pi) all over
  n.</span> </p><p><span m='2849000'>And, this part will turn out to be (one minus
  cosine n pi) over</span> <span m='2854000'>n also. And therefore,</span> <span m='2860000'>the
  answer will be two minus two cosine, two over n times,</span> <span m='2868000'>right,
  two minus, two times (one minus cosine n</span> <span m='2875000'>pi) over n.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2881000'>No, okay, now, what's this?</span> </p><p><span m='2883000'>This
  is minus one if n is odd. It's plus one if n is even.</span> </p><p><span m='2889000'>Now,
  either you can work with it this way, or you can combine</span> <span m='2895000'>the
  two of them into a single expression.</span> </p><p><span m='2899000'>Its minus
  one to the nth power takes care of both of</span> <span m='2906000'>them. But, the
  way the answer is</span> <span m='2909000'>normally expressed, it would be minus
  two over n,</span> <span m='2914000'>two over n times, if n is even,</span> <span
  m='2917000'>I get zero. If n is odd,</span> <span m='2921000'>I get two. So, times
  two,</span> <span m='2923000'>if n is odd, and zero if n is even.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2926000'>So, it's four over n, or it's zero,</span> <span m='2930000'>and the
  final series is a sum of those coefficients times the</span> <span m='2935000'>appropriate--
  cosine or sine? Sine terms because the cosine</span> <span m='2941000'>terms were
  all coefficients, all turned out to be zero.</span> </p><p><span m='2948000'>I'm
  sorry I didn't have the chance to do that calculation in</span> <span m='2953000'>detail.
  But, I think that's enough</span> <span m='2956000'>sketch for you to be able to
  do the rest of it yourself.</span> </p>
