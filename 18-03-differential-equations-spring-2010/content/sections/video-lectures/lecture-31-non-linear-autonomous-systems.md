title: 'Lecture 31: Non-linear Autonomous Systems'
transcript: <p><span m='8000'>So the topic for today is we have a system like the
  kind we</span> <span m='14000'>have been studying, but there is now a difference.</span>
  </p><p><span m='20000'>A system of first order differential equations,</span> <span
  m='25000'>just two of them. It is an autonomous system</span> <span m='30000'>meaning,
  of course, that there is no t explicitly</span> <span m='36000'>on the right-hand
  side. But what makes this different,</span> <span m='42000'>now, is that it is nonlinear.</span>
  </p><p><span m='56000'>In other words, the functions on the right-hand</span> <span
  m='59000'>side are no longer simple things like ax plus by,</span> <span m='63000'>cx
  plus dy. Those are the kind we have been</span> <span m='67000'>studying. But we
  are going to allow them</span> <span m='70000'>to have quadratic terms, sines, cosines,</span>
  <span m='73000'>different stuff there that are not linear functions anymore.</span>
  </p><p><span m='78000'>And the problem is, if it's a linear system you</span> <span
  m='81000'>know how to get a sketch of its trajectories without using the</span>
  <span m='86000'>computer by using eigenlines. You were very good at that on</span>
  <span m='93000'>the exam on Friday. Most of you could do that very</span> <span
  m='98000'>well. But what do you do if you have</span> <span m='102000'>a nonlinear
  system? The problem is to sketch its</span> <span m='107000'>trajectories.</span>
  </p><p><span m='120000'>In general, there are not analytic formulas for the</span>
  <span m='123000'>solutions to nonlinear systems like that.</span> </p><p><span m='126000'>There
  are only computer-drawn things.</span> </p><p><span m='128000'>But sometimes you
  have to get qualitative information,</span> <span m='132000'>a quick idea of how
  the trajectories look.</span> </p><p><span m='135000'>And, especially on Friday,
  I will give you examples of</span> <span m='138000'>stuff that you can do that the
  computer cannot do very well at</span> <span m='142000'>all. Okay, so the problem
  is to</span> <span m='144000'>sketch those trajectories. Now, what I am going to
  do is</span> <span m='148000'>-- The way I will give the lecture</span> <span m='153000'>is,
  this is the general problem. We have to do two things sort</span> <span m='159000'>of
  simultaneously. I will give a general</span> <span m='162000'>explanation using
  x and y, but then, as we do each step of</span> <span m='168000'>the process and
  talk about it in general, I would like to carry</span> <span m='174000'>it out on
  a specific example. And so we will do it with a</span> <span m='180000'>specific
  example. The example I am going to carry</span> <span m='184000'>out is that of
  the nonlinear pendulum.</span> </p><p><span m='190000'>I am using this because it
  illustrates virtually</span> <span m='193000'>everything. And, in addition,</span>
  <span m='196000'>it has the great advantage that, since we know how a</span> <span
  m='200000'>pendulum swings, we will be able to,</span> <span m='203000'>when we
  get the answer, verify it and,</span> <span m='206000'>at various stages of the
  procedure, verify that the</span> <span m='210000'>mathematics is, in fact, in agreement
  with our</span> <span m='214000'>physical intuition. It is going to be a lightly</span>
  <span m='219000'>damped pendulum because I am going to have to put in numbers</span>
  <span m='223000'>in order to do the calculations. And that seems like a good case</span>
  <span m='228000'>which illustrates several types of behavior.</span> </p><p><span
  m='231000'>Let's first of all, before we talk in general,</span> <span m='235000'>remind
  you of the pendulum. The pendulum I am talking about</span> <span m='240000'>has
  the vertex from which it swings.</span> </p><p><span m='244000'>This is a rigid
  rod. It is not one of these</span> <span m='248000'>string-type pendulums. There
  is a mass here.</span> </p><p><span m='252000'>The rigid rod is of length l. And
  so it swings in a circular</span> <span m='257000'>orbit like that back and forth
  in a circle.</span> </p><p><span m='261000'>And let's put in the vertical distance,
  the vertical position</span> <span m='267000'>rather. And now, as variables,</span>
  <span m='270000'>of course normally we use neutral variables like x and y.</span>
  </p><p><span m='275000'>But here x and y are not relevant variables to describing</span>
  <span m='279000'>the way the mass moves. The obviously relevant variable</span>
  <span m='284000'>is theta, this angle. Now, I am taking it in the</span> <span m='287000'>positive
  direction. Here theta is zero.</span> </p><p><span m='290000'>As it swings, theta
  becomes positive.</span> </p><p><span m='293000'>Over here, when it is horizontal,
  theta has the value</span> <span m='297000'>pi over two and then so on it goes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='302000'>Values here correspond to negative values of theta.</span>
  </p><p><span m='306000'>That is how it swings. Now, just to remind you of the</span>
  <span m='310000'>equation that this satisfies, it satisfies F equals ma,</span>
  <span m='315000'>rather ma equals F. Now, the acceleration is along</span> <span
  m='319000'>the circular path. And that is different from the</span> <span m='323000'>angular
  acceleration. I have to put in the factor of</span> <span m='328000'>the length.
  You had that a lot in 8.01 so I</span> <span m='332000'>am simply going to write
  it down.</span> </p><p><span m='335000'>It is the mass. Therefore, the linear</span>
  <span m='338000'>acceleration along the circular path is equal to the angular</span>
  <span m='344000'>acceleration times l. It is l times theta prime</span> <span m='348000'>prime,
  or double dot if you prefer.</span> </p><p><span m='351000'>And so this much of
  it is the acceleration vector.</span> </p><p><span m='355000'>Now, once the force
  is acting on it, well, there is a force of</span> <span m='360000'>gravity which
  is pulling it straight down.</span> </p><p><span m='366000'>But, of course, that
  is not the relevant force.</span> </p><p><span m='369000'>I am interested in the
  force that acts along that circular</span> <span m='374000'>line. And that will
  not be all of the</span> <span m='377000'>pink line but only its component in that
  direction.</span> </p><p><span m='381000'>And the component, I fill out the little
  right</span> <span m='385000'>triangle. And then the way to get the</span> <span
  m='388000'>component in that direction, the vertical pink part has the</span> <span
  m='392000'>magnitude mg. But, since I only want this</span> <span m='396000'>part,
  I have to multiply by the sign of this angle.</span> </p><p><span m='399000'>Now,
  sometimes I have given on a diagnostic test to students</span> <span m='403000'>when
  they enter to what angle is that?</span> </p><p><span m='405000'>But, of course,
  anybody can guess it must be</span> <span m='408000'>theta. Otherwise, why would
  he be</span> <span m='410000'>asking it? So this is still the angle</span> <span
  m='412000'>theta. You can prove these two</span> <span m='414000'>triangles are
  similar. One of them I haven't even</span> <span m='417000'>written in, but it would
  be the right triangle whose leg is</span> <span m='421000'>perpendicular to it.
  So the right angle is here.</span> </p><p><span m='426000'>If that is theta then
  the length of this small pink line</span> <span m='431000'>is mg times the sine
  of theta.</span> </p><p><span m='435000'>That is the force due gravity. It is mg
  sine theta.</span> </p><p><span m='440000'>Except in what direction is it? It is
  acting in the negative</span> <span m='445000'>direction. This is theta increasing.</span>
  </p><p><span m='450000'>This is the opposite direction, so I should put a negative
  sign</span> <span m='455000'>in front of it. But that is not the only force.</span>
  </p><p><span m='459000'>There is also a damping force that goes with a velocity.</span>
  </p><p><span m='464000'>And that also occurs if the angular velocity is positive,</span>
  <span m='468000'>the angle theta is increasing, in other words,</span> <span m='472000'>the
  damping force resists that. It is opposite to the velocity.</span> </p><p><span
  m='479000'>So the velocity is going to be l times theta prime.</span> </p><p><span
  m='482000'>There is my velocity v. Linear velocity,</span> <span m='485000'>not
  angular velocity. And so this is going to be a</span> <span m='488000'>negative
  times some constant times that c1.</span> </p><p><span m='491000'>Now, that is the
  equation. But let's make it look a little</span> <span m='495000'>better by getting
  rid of some of these constants.</span> </p><p><span m='499000'>If I write it out
  this way and put everything on the left-hand</span> <span m='503000'>side, the way
  it is usually done in writing a second order</span> <span m='507000'>differential
  equation. Theta I am going to divide</span> <span m='512000'>through by ml and put
  everything on the left-hand side and in the</span> <span m='517000'>right order.
  Next should come the theta</span> <span m='520000'>prime term. And so that is going
  to be c1l</span> <span m='523000'>divided by ml, so that is c1 over m.</span> </p><p><span
  m='526000'>The l's cancel out. And, finally,</span> <span m='528000'>the last term
  on the right, I will move this over to the</span> <span m='533000'>left, but remember
  everything is being divided by ml,</span> <span m='537000'>so the m's cancel out,
  and it is plus g over l times</span> <span m='541000'>the sine of theta. That is
  our differential</span> <span m='545000'>equation. But let's make it look still
  a</span> <span m='548000'>little bit better by lumping these constants and giving
  them</span> <span m='553000'>new names. It is going to be finally theta</span> <span
  m='556000'>double prime. I will simply call this thing</span> <span m='559000'>the
  damping constant. I will lump those two together</span> <span m='563000'>into single
  damping constant. And then g over l,</span> <span m='567000'>I will lump those together,
  too.</span> </p><p><span m='569000'>And we usually call that k. It is k sine theta.</span>
  </p><p><span m='574000'>Now, this is a second-order</span> <span m='577000'>different
  equation, but it is not linear.</span> </p><p><span m='580000'>If this were a month
  and a half ago and I said solve that,</span> <span m='585000'>you would stare at
  me. But, anyway,</span> <span m='587000'>you couldn't solve that. And nobody can,</span>
  <span m='590000'>in some sense. It is a nonlinear equation.</span> </p><p><span
  m='594000'>It doesn't have any exact solution.</span> </p><p><span m='596000'>The
  only thing you could do is look for a solution in infinite</span> <span m='601000'>series
  or something like that. Well, what do you do?</span> </p><p><span m='606000'>You
  throw it on the computer, that is the easy answer,</span> <span m='611000'>but what
  does the computer do? Well, the first thing the</span> <span m='615000'>computer
  does is turns it into a system because the computer is</span> <span m='620000'>going
  to use numerical methods to solve it.</span> </p><p><span m='625000'>But only those
  methods, the formulas it uses,</span> <span m='628000'>Euler or modified or improved
  Euler or the Runge-Cutta method,</span> <span m='632000'>they are always expressed
  not for single higher-order</span> <span m='636000'>equations, but instead they
  always assume that the equation</span> <span m='641000'>has been converted to a
  first order system.</span> </p><p><span m='644000'>Let's do that for the computer,
  even though it will do it</span> <span m='648000'>itself if nobody tells it not
  to.</span> </p><p><span m='650000'>Theta prime is equal to, now I have to figure
  out what</span> <span m='654000'>new variable to introduce. Normally we use x prime
  and</span> <span m='660000'>call that y. That really doesn't seem to be</span> <span
  m='663000'>very suitable here. But what do the physicists call</span> <span m='667000'>it?
  This is the angular velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='669000'>And the standard designation
  for that is omega.</span> </p><p><span m='673000'>Two Greek letters. I told you
  this was going to be</span> <span m='676000'>hard. Omega prime equals what?</span>
  </p><p><span m='679000'>Well, omega prime equals, now you do it in the standard</span>
  <span m='683000'>way, you convert the system, but remember you have to put</span>
  <span m='687000'>the theta first. So it is minus k sine theta.</span> </p><p><span
  m='692000'>The theta first and then the</span> <span m='696000'>omega term first.
  So minus c times omega,</span> <span m='699000'>minus c theta prime, but theta prime
  is,</span> <span m='702000'>in real life, omega.</span> </p><p><span m='704000'>And
  now we have our acceptable system.</span> </p><p><span m='707000'>The only problem
  is I have not put in any numbers yet.</span> </p><p><span m='711000'>The numbers
  I am going to put in will make it lightly damped.</span> </p><p><span m='718000'>I
  am going to give c, think of it here,</span> <span m='720000'>this is the damping,
  and this is the stuff</span> <span m='723000'>representing, well, if I want to make
  it</span> <span m='726000'>lightly damped all I am saying is that c should be small</span>
  <span m='730000'>compared with k, but it doesn't have to be very</span> <span m='733000'>small.
  I am going to take c equal one</span> <span m='736000'>and k equal two, and that
  will make it</span> <span m='740000'>lightly enough damped. This is the lightly
  damped</span> <span m='743000'>value, values which give underdamping.</span> </p><p><span
  m='746000'>In other words, they are going to allow the</span> <span m='749000'>pendulum
  to swing back and forth instead of strictly going ug and</span> <span m='754000'>ending
  up there. Finally, therefore,</span> <span m='758000'>the system that we are going
  to calculate is where theta prime</span> <span m='764000'>equals omega and omega
  prime equals negative two sine theta</span> <span m='770000'>minus omega.</span>
  </p><p><span m='774000'>And now what do we do with that?</span> </p><p><span m='777000'>There
  is our example. That is our system that</span> <span m='781000'>represents a pendulum
  swinging back and forth,</span> <span m='785000'>damped away. And now let's go back
  to the</span> <span m='788000'>general theory. And, in general,</span> <span m='790000'>if
  you have a nonlinear system,</span> <span m='795000'>how do you go about analyzing
  it?</span> </p><p><span m='802000'>The first step is to find the simplest possible
  solutions,</span> <span m='807000'>solutions that you hope can be found by inspection.</span>
  </p><p><span m='811000'>Now, what would they be? They are the solutions that</span>
  <span m='816000'>consist of a single point. How could a solution be a</span> <span
  m='820000'>single point? Well, like the origin for a</span> <span m='824000'>linear
  system, those points which form</span> <span m='827000'>solutions all by themselves
  are called the critical points.</span> </p><p><span m='832000'>I am looking for
  the critical points of the system.</span> </p><p><span m='837000'>That is the first
  step. The definition is a critical</span> <span m='843000'>point x zero, y zero.</span>
  </p><p><span m='846000'>For that to be a critical point</span> <span m='850000'>means
  that it makes the right-hand side zero.</span> </p><p><span m='855000'>The f is
  zero there, and the g is zero there.</span> </p><p><span m='859000'>See the significance
  of that? If you have such a point,</span> <span m='865000'>let's say there is a
  critical point, what is the velocity</span> <span m='871000'>field at that point?
  Well, it is given by the</span> <span m='876000'>vectors on the right-hand side,
  but the components are zero.</span> </p><p><span m='880000'>That means, at this
  point the velocity vector is zero.</span> </p><p><span m='883000'>Well, that means
  if a solution starts there,</span> <span m='886000'>you put the mouse there and
  tell it to move,</span> <span m='889000'>where do you go? It has no reason to go
  anywhere</span> <span m='892000'>since the velocity vector is zero there.</span>
  </p><p><span m='895000'>So it sits there for all time. And indeed it solves the</span>
  <span m='898000'>system, doesn't it? It makes the right-hand side</span> <span m='903000'>zero
  and it makes the left-hand side zero because x equals x</span> <span m='908000'>zero,
  y equals y zero for</span> <span m='912000'>all time. If that is true for all time
  it</span> <span m='915000'>sits there then the derivatives, with respect to time
  are zero,</span> <span m='920000'>so the left-hand sides are zero, the right-hand
  sides are</span> <span m='925000'>zero and everybody is happy. Well, these are great
  points.</span> </p><p><span m='932000'>How do I find them? Well, by looking for
  points</span> <span m='937000'>that make these two functions zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m='941000'>I find them by solving simultaneously the equations f</span> <span m='946000'>of
  (x, y) equals zero and g of (x, y) equals zero.</span> </p><p><span m='955000'>A
  pair of equations. But the trouble is those are</span> <span m='961000'>not linear
  equations. Linear equations you know how</span> <span m='964000'>to solve, but they
  are not linear equations.</span> </p><p><span m='967000'>They are nonlinear equations
  that you don't know how to</span> <span m='971000'>solve. And, to some extent,</span>
  <span m='973000'>nobody else does either. There are very fat books in the</span>
  <span m='977000'>library whose topic is how to solve just a pair of equations,</span>
  <span m='982000'>f of (x, y) equals zero, g of (x, y) equals zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m='985000'>And it is quite a hard problem. It is even a hard problem by</span> <span
  m='990000'>computer. Because, if you know</span> <span m='993000'>approximately
  where the solution is going to be,</span> <span m='996000'>you can make up the little
  screen and then the computer</span> <span m='1000000'>will find it for you. Or,
  even without a screen,</span> <span m='1003000'>it will calculate it by Newton's
  method or something</span> <span m='1007000'>else, it will zero in. The problem
  is,</span> <span m='1010000'>if you don't know in advance roughly where the critical
  point</span> <span m='1014000'>is that you are looking for, there are a lot of numbers.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1018000'>They go to infinity that way and infinity that way.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1023000'>In general, it is almost an impossible problem.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1026000'>The only thing that makes it possible is that these problems</span>
  <span m='1031000'>always come from the real world and one has some physical</span>
  <span m='1035000'>feeling, one hopes, for where the critical point</span> <span
  m='1039000'>is. I am going to assume breezily</span> <span m='1041000'>and cheerily
  we can solve those. And I am only going to give you</span> <span m='1046000'>examples
  where it is possible to solve them.</span> </p><p><span m='1051000'>But even there,
  you have to watch out.</span> </p><p><span m='1053000'>There is a certain trickiness
  that will be talked about in the</span> <span m='1057000'>recitations tomorrow.
  Okay, so we found the critical</span> <span m='1061000'>points. Let's do it for
  our example.</span> </p><p><span m='1063000'>Let's find the critical point. What
  is the pair of equations</span> <span m='1067000'>we have to solve? We have to solve
  the equations</span> <span m='1070000'>omega equals zero, minus two sine theta minus</span>
  <span m='1073000'>omega equals zero.</span> </p><p><span m='1076000'>Now, it is
  not always this easy.</span> </p><p><span m='1080000'>But the solution is omega
  is zero.</span> </p><p><span m='1083000'>If omega is zero, then sine theta is zero,</span>
  <span m='1087000'>and sine theta is zero at the</span> <span m='1092000'>integral
  multiples of pi. The critical points are omega</span> <span m='1098000'>is always
  zero and theta is zero, or it could be plus or</span> <span m='1104000'>minus pi,
  plus or minus two pi and so on.</span> </p><p><span m='1110000'>In other words,
  there are an infinity of</span> <span m='1112000'>critical points. That seems a
  little</span> <span m='1114000'>discouraging. On the other hand,</span> <span m='1116000'>there
  are really only two. There are really physically</span> <span m='1120000'>only two
  because omega equals zero means the mass is not</span> <span m='1124000'>moving.
  The angular velocity is zero,</span> <span m='1126000'>so it is only the theta position
  which is changing.</span> </p><p><span m='1129000'>Now, what are the possible theta
  positions?</span> </p><p><span m='1132000'>Well, here is our nonlinear pendulum.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1136000'>Here is the critical point, theta equals zero,</span> <span
  m='1139000'>omega equals zero. Theta equals zero means the rod</span> <span m='1143000'>is
  vertical. Omega equals zero means that it</span> <span m='1147000'>is not moving,
  despite the fact that it is</span> <span m='1150000'>moving. Theoretically it is
  not moving.</span> </p><p><span m='1154000'>Now, what is the other one? Well, there
  is theta equals pi.</span> </p><p><span m='1158000'>Theta is now, starting from
  zero and</span> <span m='1161000'>increasing, I hope, through positive theta.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1165000'>And when it gets to pi, it is sticking straight up in</span>
  <span m='1169000'>the air. And so the claim is that</span> <span m='1174000'>another
  critical point is theta equals pi and omega equals zero.</span> </p><p><span m='1180000'>In
  other words, if it gets to this position,</span> <span m='1184000'>it starts out
  in this position and stays there for all time,</span> <span m='1189000'>as you see.
  [LAUGHTER] But my point is what</span> <span m='1193000'>about negative pi? That
  is the same as pi.</span> </p><p><span m='1197000'>Two pi is the same as zero. So
  physically there really are</span> <span m='1203000'>only two critical points, this
  one and that one.</span> </p><p><span m='1208000'>And they obviously have something
  very different about</span> <span m='1213000'>them. This critical point is stable.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1216000'>If I start near there, I approach that critical point</span>
  <span m='1221000'>in infinite time. This one, if I start near</span> <span m='1225000'>there,
  I do not stay near there. I always leave it.</span> </p><p><span m='1231000'>Of
  the two critical points, physically it is clear that the</span> <span m='1238000'>critical
  point is zero, zero and the other guys that</span> <span m='1244000'>look like it,
  two pi zero and so on is a</span> <span m='1249000'>stable critical point. Whereas,
  pi zero,</span> <span m='1253000'>when theta is sticking straight up in the air,</span>
  <span m='1259000'>is unstable. Now, of course,</span> <span m='1263000'>we will
  want to see that mathematically also,</span> <span m='1266000'>but basically there
  are just physically two point.</span> </p><p><span m='1270000'>There are just two
  critical points.</span> </p><p><span m='1272000'>Well, that raises the question
  what about all the others?</span> </p><p><span m='1276000'>As you will see, we have
  to have those.</span> </p><p><span m='1279000'>They are an essential part of the
  problem.</span> </p><p><span m='1282000'>They are not just redundant baggage that
  is trailing along.</span> </p><p><span m='1286000'>They are really important. But
  you will see that when we</span> <span m='1293000'>talk about finally how the trajectories
  look and how the</span> <span m='1300000'>solutions look. Now what do we do?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1303000'>Well, we found the critical points, and now the work begins.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1310000'>Virtually all the work is in this next step.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1316000'>What do we do? Step two.</span> </p><p><span m='1320000'>I can only
  describe it in general terms,</span> <span m='1325000'>but here is what you do.
  For each critical point x zero,</span> <span m='1333000'>y zero, a procedure that
  has to be done at each one,</span> <span m='1341000'>you linearize the system near
  that point.</span> </p><p><span m='1348000'>In other words, you may find a linear
  system,</span> <span m='1352000'>the good kind, the kind you know about,</span>
  <span m='1357000'>which is a good approximation to the nonlinear system at that</span>
  <span m='1363000'>critical point. Plot the trajectories of this</span> <span m='1368000'>linearized
  system. And you do that near the</span> <span m='1373000'>critical point.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1384000'>How do you plot the trajectories?</span> </p><p><span m='1385000'>Well,
  that you knew how to do on Friday so I am assuming you</span> <span m='1389000'>still
  know how to do it on Monday.</span> </p><p><span m='1391000'>In other words, if
  the system is linear you</span> <span m='1394000'>know how to plot the trajectories
  of it by</span> <span m='1396000'>calculating eigenvalues and eigenvectors and maybe
  the</span> <span m='1400000'>direction of motion if it is a spiral.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1402000'>I will give you a couple of examples of that when we work</span> <span
  m='1405000'>out the pendulum. But, on the other hand,</span> <span m='1409000'>how
  do I line arise a system? Well, there are two methods.</span> </p><p><span m='1413000'>There
  is one method the book gives you, which by and large I</span> <span m='1417000'>do
  not want you to use, although I will give you an</span> <span m='1421000'>example
  of it now. I want you to use another</span> <span m='1424000'>method because it
  is much faster.</span> </p><p><span m='1426000'>Especially if you have to handle
  several critical points</span> <span m='1430000'>it is much, much faster. Let's
  first carry this out on</span> <span m='1434000'>an easy case, and then I will show
  you how to</span> <span m='1437000'>do it in general. Just this once I will use
  the</span> <span m='1442000'>book's method because I think it is the method which
  would</span> <span m='1448000'>naturally occur to you. Let's linearize this example
  at</span> <span m='1453000'>the point zero, zero.</span> </p><p><span m='1455000'>What
  should be the linearized system?</span> </p><p><span m='1458000'>In other words,
  it's only the nonlinear terms I</span> <span m='1463000'>have to worry about. Well,
  the minus omega is fine.</span> </p><p><span m='1469000'>It is that stupid sine
  theta that I don't like.</span> </p><p><span m='1473000'>But if theta is small,
  in other words,</span> <span m='1477000'>if I stay near zero, I could replace sine
  theta by</span> <span m='1482000'>theta. The linearized system is minus</span> <span
  m='1486000'>two. You replace sine theta by</span> <span m='1489000'>theta, since
  sine theta is approximately theta if theta is</span> <span m='1495000'>small, if
  theta is near zero. It is the first term of its</span> <span m='1502000'>Taylor
  series you can think of, or it's just the linear</span> <span m='1506000'>approximation
  starts out sine theta equals theta.</span> </p><p><span m='1510000'>That is it.
  Or, you draw a picture.</span> </p><p><span m='1512000'>I don't know. There are
  a millions of ways to</span> <span m='1516000'>do it. So we have it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1517000'>Now what do I do? Okay, now we will plot that.</span> </p><p><span m='1521000'>The
  matrix, let's do our little routine, in other words.</span> </p><p><span m='1525000'>I
  am writing right to left for no reason.</span> </p><p><span m='1530000'>The matrix
  is, now I am just going to make</span> <span m='1534000'>marks on a board the way
  you did on your exam,</span> <span m='1539000'>zero, one. [LAUGHTER] I don't know
  what I</span> <span m='1543000'>am doing, but you know. Negative two,</span> <span
  m='1547000'>negative one, and then I write down the</span> <span m='1551000'>eigen-whatchamacallits.
  Lambda squared,</span> <span m='1555000'>plus lambda, minus the trace.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1560000'>The determinant is minus, minus two, so it is plus two</span> <span
  m='1565000'>equals zero. And then, since it doesn't</span> <span m='1569000'>occur
  to me how to factor this, I will use the quadratic</span> <span m='1574000'>formula.
  It is negative one plus or</span> <span m='1578000'>minus the square root of, b
  squared minus 4ac,</span> <span m='1582000'>minus seven. Complex.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1584000'>That means it is going to be a spiral.</span> </p><p><span m='1590000'>I
  am going to get a spiral. Will it be a source or a sink</span> <span m='1594000'>since
  they are complex roots? Complex eigenvalues give a</span> <span m='1599000'>spiral.
  A source or a sink?</span> </p><p><span m='1601000'>I tell that from the sine of
  the real part.</span> </p><p><span m='1604000'>The real part is negative one-half.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1607000'>Therefore, the amplitude is shrinking like e to the minus
  t</span> <span m='1612000'>over two. And, therefore,</span> <span m='1615000'>the
  spiral is coming into the origin.</span> </p><p><span m='1620000'>It is a spiral
  sink since lambda equals minus one-half</span> <span m='1625000'>plus some number
  times i. Spiral sink.</span> </p><p><span m='1630000'>And the other thing to determine
  is its direction of</span> <span m='1635000'>motion, which will be what? I determine
  its direction of</span> <span m='1641000'>motion by putting in a single vector from
  the velocity field.</span> </p><p><span m='1648000'>Here it is. The vector at one,</span>
  <span m='1652000'>zero will be the same as the first column of the</span> <span
  m='1656000'>matrix. So that is zero,</span> <span m='1658000'>negative two.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1659000'>Here is a vector from the velocity field,</span> <span
  m='1662000'>and that shows that the motion is clockwise and is spiraling</span>
  <span m='1666000'>into the origin. That is a picture,</span> <span m='1669000'>therefore,
  at the origin of how that looks.</span> </p><p><span m='1672000'>Now, it is of the
  utmost importance for your</span> <span m='1675000'>understanding of what comes
  now that you understand in what</span> <span m='1679000'>sense this picture corresponds
  to the physical behavior of the</span> <span m='1683000'>pendulum. Let's start it
  over here.</span> </p><p><span m='1688000'>What is it doing? That means that theta
  is some</span> <span m='1693000'>number like one, for example.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1696000'>Let's make it smaller. Let's say a little bit.</span> </p><p><span m='1700000'>And
  this is the omega access. If it starts over here that</span> <span m='1706000'>means
  the angular velocity is zero and theta is a small</span> <span m='1712000'>positive
  number. Theta is a small positive</span> <span m='1717000'>number. The angular velocity
  is zero.</span> </p><p><span m='1720000'>It's velocity zero, theta small and positive.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1724000'>I release it and it does that. What does this have to do
  with</span> <span m='1730000'>the spiral? Well, the spiral is exactly a</span> <span
  m='1734000'>mathematical picture of this motion.</span> </p><p><span m='1737000'>What
  happens? Theta starts to decrease.</span> </p><p><span m='1742000'>And the angular
  velocity increases but in the negative</span> <span m='1746000'>direction. This
  is negative angular</span> <span m='1748000'>velocity. Theta is decreasing.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1751000'>The angular velocity gets bigger and bigger.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1754000'>And it is biggest, most negative when theta is</span> <span m='1758000'>zero.
  It has reached the vertical</span> <span m='1760000'>position is when the angular
  velocity is biggest.</span> </p><p><span m='1764000'>It continues then. Theta gets
  negative,</span> <span m='1767000'>but the angular velocity then decreases to zero.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1777000'>Now the angular velocity is zero and theta is at its most</span>
  <span m='1781000'>negative, and then it reverses. Angular velocity gets positive</span>
  <span m='1786000'>as theta increases again, and so on.</span> </p><p><span m='1788000'>These
  represent the successive swings back and forth.</span> </p><p><span m='1792000'>Notice
  the fact that it is damped is reflected in the fact</span> <span m='1797000'>that
  each successive swing, the biggest that theta gets is</span> <span m='1801000'>a
  little less than it was before.</span> </p><p><span m='1805000'>In other words,
  this point is not quite as far</span> <span m='1808000'>out as that one. And this
  one isn't as far out</span> <span m='1811000'>as that one. In other words,</span>
  <span m='1813000'>it is spiraling in.</span> </p><p><span m='1820000'>Well, I hope
  that is clear because we now have to go to the</span> <span m='1826000'>next critical
  point. And now we have a little</span> <span m='1831000'>problem. If I want to do
  the next</span> <span m='1834000'>critical point, so what I want to do now is,</span>
  <span m='1838000'>in other words, I want to linearize at the</span> <span m='1842000'>point
  pi zero where theta is pi and the thing is sticking up in</span> <span m='1848000'>the
  air. The question is,</span> <span m='1850000'>how am I going to do that? This trick
  of replacing sine</span> <span m='1855000'>theta by theta, that doesn't work at
  pi.</span> </p><p><span m='1859000'>That works at zero.</span> </p><p><span m='1868000'>Now
  we have to go to the next step of the method.</span> </p><p><span m='1871000'>The
  way to do this, in general, as you will read in</span> <span m='1874000'>the notes
  because, as I say, this is not in the</span> <span m='1877000'>book, is to calculate
  the Jacobian.</span> </p><p><span m='1880000'>I mean the Jacobian matrix. The Jacobian
  is the</span> <span m='1883000'>determinant. I mean, before you put the two</span>
  <span m='1886000'>bars down and made a determinant, you called it just</span> <span
  m='1889000'>the Jacobian matrix. And the formula for it is,</span> <span m='1894000'>it
  is calculated from f and g. The top line is the partial of</span> <span m='1899000'>f
  with respect to x and y, and the bottom line is the</span> <span m='1904000'>partial
  of g with respect to x and y.</span> </p><p><span m='1907000'>So that is the Jacobian
  matrix.</span> </p><p><span m='1917000'>I hope I get a chance at the end of the
  period to explain to</span> <span m='1922000'>you why, but I am most anxious right
  now to at least get you</span> <span m='1927000'>familiar with the algorithm, how
  to do it.</span> </p><p><span m='1931000'>The notes describe the y of it, if we
  don't get a chance to get</span> <span m='1937000'>to it, but I hope we will. What
  do you do?</span> </p><p><span m='1940000'>The Jacobian matrix. You calculate it
  at the point x</span> <span m='1945000'>zero, y zero.</span> </p><p><span m='1949000'>I
  will indicate that by putting a subscript zero on it.</span> </p><p><span m='1952000'>This
  means without the subscript zero it is the</span> <span m='1955000'>Jacobian matrix
  calculated out of those four partial</span> <span m='1959000'>derivatives. When
  I put a subscript zero,</span> <span m='1961000'>I mean I evaluated it at the critical
  point by plugging in</span> <span m='1965000'>each entry as a function of x and
  y.</span> </p><p><span m='1967000'>You plug in for x equals x zero, y equals y zero,</span>
  <span m='1972000'>and you get a numerical matrix.</span> </p><p><span m='1974000'>That
  is the matrix which is the matrix of the linearized system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1980000'>This is the matrix of the linearized system.</span> </p><p><span m='1988000'>Trust
  me, it is. Now, since I don't expect you</span> <span m='1991000'>to trust me, let's
  calculate it. Here, we got the matrix another</span> <span m='1996000'>way, by this
  procedure of saying sine theta is theta-- What would</span> <span m='2001000'>we
  have gotten if we had done it instead by the linearized</span> <span m='2005000'>system?
  Let's do it that way.</span> </p><p><span m='2007000'>Let's do it via the Jacobian.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2017000'>I need to know the Jacobian of the system, which I have</span>
  <span m='2023000'>conveniently covered up. There is the system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2027000'>The Jacobian matrix is what? The top line,</span> <span m='2032000'>I
  take the partial derivative of omega first with respect to</span> <span m='2039000'>theta
  and then with respect to omega.</span> </p><p><span m='2044000'>I then take the
  second line on the right-hand side.</span> </p><p><span m='2048000'>I take its partial
  with respect to theta first.</span> </p><p><span m='2052000'>That is negative two
  cosine theta.</span> </p><p><span m='2056000'>And, thinking ahead, I erase the one
  and move it</span> <span m='2060000'>over a little bit. And what is the partial
  of that</span> <span m='2064000'>thing with respect to omega? It is negative one.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2070000'>Does everyone see how I calculated that Jacobian matrix?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2075000'>And now I want to evaluate it. Let's do our old case first.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2080000'>At zero, zero what would this have</span> <span m='2085000'>amounted
  to? This would have given me zero,</span> <span m='2089000'>one. The cosine of theta
  at zero is</span> <span m='2092000'>one, so this is negative two, negative one.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2096000'>I'm screwed. [LAUGHTER]</span> <span m='2100000'>That is
  the same as that. Now you see it,</span> <span m='2104000'>now you don't. We got
  our old answer back.</span> </p><p><span m='2108000'>That should give us enough
  confidence to use it in the new</span> <span m='2114000'>case, where I don't have
  an old answer to compare it with.</span> </p><p><span m='2120000'>What is it going
  to be at pi, zero?</span> </p><p><span m='2123000'>The answer is J zero is now going
  to be --</span> <span m='2130000'>Well, everything is the same. Zero, one, negative
  one.</span> </p><p><span m='2134000'>And here cosine of pi is negative one,</span>
  <span m='2138000'>so negative two times negative one is two.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2141000'>Everything is the same, except there is a two there now</span> <span
  m='2146000'>instead of negative two. Lambda squared plus lambda,</span> <span m='2151000'>the
  determinant, is now negative two.</span> </p><p><span m='2154000'>And this factors
  into lambda plus two times</span> <span m='2160000'>lambda minus one.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2168000'>So lambda equals one. The corresponding eigenvector.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2172000'>I subtract one here, so the equation is minus a1</span> <span m='2177000'>plus
  a2 is zero.</span> </p><p><span m='2180000'>The solution is one, one, e to the t.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2184000'>And for the other one, it's lambda is equal to</span> <span
  m='2188000'>negative two. This is the sort of stuff you</span> <span m='2193000'>can
  do, so I am doing it fast. Zero minus negative two is two.</span> </p><p><span m='2198000'>So
  the equation is 2a1 plus a2 equals zero.</span> </p><p><span m='2203000'>And the
  solution is now, I give a1 the value one,</span> <span m='2208000'>a2 will be negative
  two, and that is times e to the</span> <span m='2212000'>minus 2t.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2220000'>Well, what does the thing then actually look like?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2225000'>What I am now going to do is, I drew a picture before,</span> <span
  m='2231000'>that spiral picture we had before of the way the thing</span> <span
  m='2237000'>looked at the point zero, zero.</span> </p><p><span m='2242000'>So at
  the point pi, zero how does it</span> <span m='2247000'>look, now? Well, it looks
  like the origin,</span> <span m='2252000'>but I am thinking of it really as the
  point pi,</span> <span m='2257000'>zero. In other words,</span> <span m='2259000'>I
  am thinking of a linear variable change sliding along</span> <span m='2264000'>the
  axis so that the point pi, zero now looks like</span> <span m='2270000'>the origin.
  If I do that then those two</span> <span m='2273000'>basic solutions, there is the
  one,</span> <span m='2276000'>one solution which is going out that way.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2283000'>And it is going out this way. But the other guy is coming in</span>
  <span m='2287000'>along the vector one, negative two.</span> </p><p><span m='2289000'>So
  one, negative two looks like this.</span> </p><p><span m='2292000'>This guy is coming
  in at a somewhat sharper angle,</span> <span m='2295000'>coming in because it is
  e to the negative 2t.</span> </p><p><span m='2299000'>And we recognize this, of
  course, as a saddle.</span> </p><p><span m='2302000'>And I would complete the trajectories
  by putting in some</span> <span m='2306000'>of the typical saddle lines like that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2310000'>Now, I say that, too, gives a picture of what is</span>
  <span m='2316000'>happening to the pendulum near that point.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2321000'>Let's, for example, look here.</span> </p><p><span m='2324000'>What
  is happening here? This is theta,</span> <span m='2329000'>or really it is theta
  minus pi, is this axis.</span> </p><p><span m='2335000'>In other words, this will
  be zero.</span> </p><p><span m='2341000'>When theta is pi this will correspond to
  the point zero.</span> </p><p><span m='2348000'>Here is omega. What is theta doing?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2352000'>Starting up there this represents a value of theta a</span>
  <span m='2358000'>little bit less than pi, a little bit to the negative.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2365000'>A little bit less than pi. Here is pi, so a little bit</span>
  <span m='2373000'>less than pi is over here. A little bit less than pi.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2380000'>A little bit less. And omega is zero.</span> </p><p><span m='2384000'>What
  happened? Theta started decreasing ever</span> <span m='2390000'>more rapidly so
  that the omega was zero here,</span> <span m='2396000'>now omega is negative and
  gets much more negative.</span> </p><p><span m='2404000'>In other words, both theta
  decreases from that</span> <span m='2409000'>point and omega decreases also. What
  happened here?</span> </p><p><span m='2414000'>Here, theta is a little bit more
  than pi.</span> </p><p><span m='2419000'>Now it is a little bit more than pi.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2423000'>Theta now increases until it gets to 2pi and then oscillates</span>
  <span m='2429000'>around 2pi. So theta increases.</span> </p><p><span m='2433000'>And
  omega increases, too, because the angular</span> <span m='2437000'>velocity started
  at zero but, as theta gets more positive,</span> <span m='2442000'>omega gets positive,
  too, because theta is</span> <span m='2446000'>increasing. So omega increases and
  theta</span> <span m='2449000'>increases and it goes off like that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2452000'>Well, the final step is to put them all together to be the big</span>
  <span m='2458000'>picture. Here we are for three,</span> <span m='2463000'>let's
  say, the big picture. Plot trajectories around each</span> <span m='2472000'>critical
  point and then add some.</span> </p><p><span m='2477000'>It's that last step that
  can cause you a little grief,</span> <span m='2485000'>but we will see how it works
  out.</span> </p><p><span m='2492000'>Add some more, according to your best</span>
  <span m='2494000'>judgment. Let's make a big picture now of</span> <span m='2497000'>our
  pendulum the way it apparently ought to look.</span> </p><p><span m='2501000'>Nice
  big axis since we are going to accommodate a lot of</span> <span m='2505000'>critical
  points here. Let's put in some critical</span> <span m='2508000'>points. Here is
  the origin.</span> </p><p><span m='2510000'>And now here is the one at pi, let's
  say, here is one at 2pi.</span> </p><p><span m='2515000'>I am going to add some
  of these others, 3pi, 4pi.</span> </p><p><span m='2520000'>I won't in their values.
  You can figure out what I mean.</span> </p><p><span m='2525000'>Zero here. And then
  here it will be</span> <span m='2528000'>negative pi, and here negative 2pi.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2531000'>I guess I can stop there. That is the theta axis,</span>
  <span m='2535000'>and here is the omega axis. And now, at each one of these,</span>
  <span m='2541000'>I stay nearby and I draw the linear trajectories,</span> <span
  m='2545000'>the trajectories of the corresponding linearized system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2552000'>We decided here that the spiral went clockwise.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2555000'>Now, this point is physically, of course, the same as that</span> <span
  m='2560000'>one. But mathematically,</span> <span m='2562000'>the Jacobian matrix
  is the same also because if theta is 2pi the</span> <span m='2567000'>cosine of
  2pi is also one. And this is the same matrix.</span> </p><p><span m='2571000'>So
  the analysis is identical. And, therefore,</span> <span m='2574000'>this point will
  also correspond to a counterclockwise spiral,</span> <span m='2579000'>as will this
  one. I am sorry, a clockwise spiral.</span> </p><p><span m='2584000'>Here, too,
  all of these points are the same.</span> </p><p><span m='2588000'>The behavior near
  them, clockwise spirals everywhere.</span> </p><p><span m='2592000'>How about the
  other ones? Well, the other ones correspond</span> <span m='2597000'>to these saddles,
  so let's draw them efficiently</span> <span m='2601000'>by doing the same thing
  on every one, mass production of saddles.</span> </p><p><span m='2606000'>There.
  And these guys go out.</span> </p><p><span m='2610000'>And the other guys come in,
  etc.</span> </p><p><span m='2615000'>And so here we have a little bit there, a little
  here,</span> <span m='2624000'>here, there, everywhere, etc.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2638000'>Now what? Now you pray for inspiration.</span> </p><p><span m='2641000'>And
  what you have to do is add trajectories that are compatible</span> <span m='2648000'>with
  the ones you have. Let's start with this guy.</span> </p><p><span m='2653000'>Where
  is it going? Well, a trajectory either goes</span> <span m='2658000'>off to infinity,
  but generally they get trapped</span> <span m='2662000'>around critical points.
  This guy must be surely doing</span> <span m='2668000'>this. How about this one?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2672000'>Yeah, sure. How about this one?</span> </p><p><span m='2675000'>Why
  not? How about that one?</span> </p><p><span m='2678000'>Yeah. But notice you are
  in trouble</span> <span m='2682000'>when two arrows you want to put in are near
  each other and going</span> <span m='2689000'>in opposite directions. That you cannot
  have.</span> </p><p><span m='2694000'>Continuity forbids it. But notice if I,</span>
  <span m='2699000'>for example, had gotten these eigenlines</span> <span m='2701000'>wrong,
  if I made this come in and those go out because I made</span> <span m='2705000'>a
  simple error in drawing the thing, I would have said but I</span> <span m='2708000'>cannot
  draw this picture because this spiral wants to go that way</span> <span m='2712000'>but
  this, right next to it, wants to go the other way.</span> </p><p><span m='2716000'>That
  is the way you would know if you made a mistake.</span> </p><p><span m='2719000'>If
  you didn't make a mistake you won't have any trouble</span> <span m='2722000'>filling
  these things out. The directions of motions of</span> <span m='2726000'>the spirals,
  everything will be compatible.</span> </p><p><span m='2730000'>Okay. What is this
  guy doing?</span> </p><p><span m='2733000'>Oh, well, it must be joining up with
  that.</span> </p><p><span m='2737000'>How about this one? Well, it must be coming
  back</span> <span m='2742000'>there. How about this one?</span> </p><p><span m='2745000'>Well,
  trajectories cannot cross.</span> </p><p><span m='2748000'>This guy cannot cross
  so it must be doing this.</span> </p><p><span m='2753000'>All right. What is that
  trajectory?</span> </p><p><span m='2757000'>Starts zero. Omega, on the other hand,</span>
  <span m='2763000'>is big and positive. Omega big and positive.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2770000'>[LAUGHTER] I am scared. Omega starts.</span> </p><p><span m='2775000'>Theta
  is zero. Omega big and positive.</span> </p><p><span m='2781000'>It went around,
  slowed up, but continued beyond</span> <span m='2788000'>pi. And, in fact,</span>
  <span m='2790000'>went too far. It continued to go here and</span> <span m='2793000'>then
  finally wound around that one.</span> </p><p><span m='2796000'>Now do you see why
  we had to have all the critical points?</span> </p><p><span m='2800000'>You have
  to have all the critical points.</span> </p><p><span m='2802000'>And not just the
  two physicals ones because the other critical</span> <span m='2807000'>points are
  necessary to describe a complicated motion that goes</span> <span m='2811000'>round
  and round and round until finally it crashes.</span> </p><p><span m='2816000'>You
  are going to practice drawing these pictures and</span> <span m='2819000'>interpreting
  them in recitation tomorrow.</span> </p>
